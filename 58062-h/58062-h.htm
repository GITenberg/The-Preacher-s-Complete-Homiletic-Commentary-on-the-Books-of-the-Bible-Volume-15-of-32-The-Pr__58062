<li>Technical note: This book makes heavy use of <span class="smcap">small caps</span> formatting.

&ldquo;small caps&rdquo; formatted in <span class="smcap">small caps.</span></li>
<li>This is a commentary on the first 39 chapters of the Biblical book of Isaiah. It was
written to help ministers with their sermon preparation. Many of the thoughts presented are
condensed from published sermons. The book is a collection of man&rsquo;s opinions on the
inspired Word of God. The Transcriber does not necessarily agree with every opinion expressed.
Among the disagreements are suggestions that the Church replaces Israel, or is &ldquo;the true Israel,&rdquo;
or that human effort has any effect on God&rsquo;s pacing of future events.
Some of the opinions expressed are unapologetically anti-Roman Catholic or culturally insensitive. The book is a product
of its time and place (late nineteenth century greater London). The U.S. conflict between North and
South is still within memory and neither the great European wars to come, nor England&rsquo;s loss
of her colonial possessions in India and Africa, nor the establishment of the State of Israel is even foreshadowed.</li>
<li>The page numbers in the first part of the book (&ldquo;front-matter&rdquo;) and
the last part of the book (&ldquo;back-matter&rdquo;) were modified from unadorned
Arabic numbers to make them unique. In this e-book, front-matter pages are identified
by lower-cased Roman numbers and back-matter pages include the letter &ldquo;A&rdquo;
(for &ldquo;Appendix&rdquo;) and either an &ldquo;L&rdquo; or an &ldquo;R&rdquo; to
identify the left or right column. The <a href="#pA1">Appendix</a> presents two translations of the
whole book of Isaiah and two additional translations of the fifty-second and fifth-third
chapters.</li>
<li>In the original, the outlines are generally in order by scripture reference and information in the
page headers helps one find an outline related to any desired passage. Due to the length
of the e-book, and the supplemental outlines added toward the end, the Transcriber
has inserted a listing of outlines in sequential order by scripture reference after
the Index of Subjects, Index of Authors, and table of Times, Seasons, and Occasions, and prior to the Introduction.</li>
<li>The footnotes in the text are identified by sequential lower-case Greek letters: &alpha;, &beta;, etc.
The Transcriber has changed them to superscript bracketed numbers to comply with current use. In the main
portion of the book, the &ldquo;footnotes&rdquo; were set in smaller type at the end of the respective outlines.
In the Appendix, footnotes were set at the bottom of each page. The text and each footnote are hyperlinked both directions.</li>
<li> Certain long outlines (<a href="#o131">The Virgin&rsquo;s Son,</a> <a href="#o201">The Burden of Dumah</a>)
and the Appendix were set almost entirely in footnote type to save page count.</li>
<li>The detailed list of Transcriber&rsquo;s changes is at the foot of the document. <a href="#DTN">Link to detailed changes.</a></li>

<h2 class="tdc">PREFATORY NOTES.</h2>

<ol>
<li>In the preparation of this Commentary, my aim throughout has been
evangelical and practical. A study of the Book of Isaiah suggests many historical,
critical, and speculative questions, but these I have entirely disregarded.
I have asked only, What messages from God has this inspired prophet for the
men of this generation? What instruction has he to give us? What warnings?
What encouragements? What consolations? To these questions I
believe there are answers in the outlines I have myself prepared, and in those
I have obtained from other sources.</li>

<li>As my work proceeded, my methods somewhat changed. I discovered
that I had commenced the Commentary on too large a scale, and that it was in
danger of becoming too large and costly. I therefore ceased to append illustrations
to the outlines, and contented myself with giving references to illustrations
in my <i>&ldquo;Homiletic Encyclop&aelig;dia of Illustrations in Theology and Morals&rdquo;</i>
and my <i>&ldquo;Dictionary of Poetical Illustrations,&rdquo;</i> using for this purpose the letters
H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I. and P.&nbsp;D.</li>

<li>I also ceased to prepare outlines on <i>all</i> the texts, and limited myself to
those most likely to be profitable to ordinary congregations.</li>

<li>As I proceeded, I also became more convinced that a book intended to be
helpful to many minds should contain the best thoughts of many minds; and
therefore, instead of preparing outlines which might be expanded into sermons,
I condensed sermons preached by others into outlines. Remembering that I
was working for ministers, I stripped the <i>thoughts</i> contained in those sermons
of most of their dress, and so the substance of a sermon of twenty pages was
frequently placed on a page. The result is that in this volume a hundred and
fifty students of Scripture&mdash;Episcopalians, Presbyterians, Congregationalists
and Baptists&mdash;combine to offer to their brethren suggestions as to the best
practical uses to which the writings of Isaiah may be put today.</li>

<li>On pp. <a href="#p447">447</a>&ndash;496 are some valuable outlines obtained too late for insertion
in their proper places. Three of them are interesting specimens of Welsh
preaching.</li>

<h1 class="tdc">ISAIAH.</h1>

<h3 class="tdc">INTRODUCTION.</h3>

<p>Of Isaiah, &ldquo;the evangelical prophet,&rdquo; nothing is <i>known</i> beyond what we are
told of him in the Scriptures. Various traditions concerning him are
current among the Jews, such as that his father Amoz was brother of King
Amaziah, and that he himself died a martyr&rsquo;s death, being sawn asunder
by order of Manasseh; but all that is <i>certain</i> is, that he was the son of Amoz;
that his prophetic ministry commenced in the reign of Uzziah, and closed
in that of Hezekiah (ch. i.&nbsp;1); that his wife was a prophetess (ch. viii.&nbsp;3),
and bare him two sons (ch. vi.&nbsp;3; viii.&nbsp;3); and that he was the author of a
portion of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah (2&nbsp;Chron. xxvi.&nbsp;22).</p>

<p>His name signifies <i>The Salvation of the Lord,</i> and this&mdash;<i>the salvation which
God works for His people from their sins and consequent misery</i>&mdash;is the great, though
not the exclusive, theme of his prophecy.</p>

<p>The length of his ministry is variously estimated. The lowest estimate
would make it comprise forty-nine years, from the last year of Uzziah to the
seventeenth of Hezekiah (<span class="smcap">b.c.</span> 759&ndash;710); the highest, sixty-four years, from the
fourth year before Uzziah&rsquo;s death to the last year of Hezekiah (<span class="smcap">b.c.</span> 762&ndash;698).</p>

<p>In the following Commentary it is assumed that the whole of the sixty-six
chapters of which the Book of Isaiah is composed, were written by one
pen. For clear and conclusive refutations of the theory of a second Isaiah,
see the introductions to the Commentaries of Alexander, Delitsch, and Kay,
and the article <span class="smcap">Isaiah</span> in Smith&rsquo;s, Kitto&rsquo;s, and Fairbairn&rsquo;s <i>Dictionaries of the
Bible.</i></p>

<p>Appended are Ewald&rsquo;s criticisms on Isaiah&rsquo;s
<span class="wsnw">style,<a id="intro_fna1" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#intro_fn1">[1]</a></span> and some admirable
observations by Dr. Kay on the <i>title</i> of Isaiah&rsquo;s prophecy, which readers of it
will do to bear in mind
<span class="wsnw">throughout.<a id="intro_fna2" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#intro_fn2">[2]</a></span></p>

<div class="footnotes"><h4 class="tdc">FOOTNOTES.</h4>
<div class="footnote" id="intro_fn1"><p><a href="#intro_fna1"><span class="label">[1]</span></a>
In Isaiah we see prophetic authorship reaching its culminating point. Everything
conspired to raise him to an elevation which no prophet before or after could as writer attain.
Among the other prophets, each of the more important ones is distinguished by some one
particular excellence, and some one particular talent. In Isaiah all kinds of talent, and all
beauties of prophetic discourse, meet together, so as mutually to temper and qualify each
other; it is not so much any single feature that distinguished him as the symmetry and perfection
of the whole.</p>

<p>We cannot fail to assume, as the first condition of Isaiah&rsquo;s particular historical greatness, a
native power, and a vivacity of spirit which, even among prophets, is seldom to be met with.
It is but rarely that we see combined in one and the same spirit the three several characteristics
of&mdash;first, the most profound prophetic excitement and the purest sentiment; next, the
most indefatigable and successful practical activity amidst all perplexities and changes of outward
life; and, thirdly, that facility and beauty in representing thought which is the characteristic
of the genuine poet; but this threefold combination we find realised in Isaiah as in no
other prophet; and form the traces which we can perceive of the unceasing joint-working of
<span class="pagenum" id="p2">[p.&nbsp;2]</span>
these three powers, we must draw our conclusions as to the original greatness of his genius.
But as prophet and as author, Isaiah stands upon that calm, sunny height, which in each
several branch of ancient literature one eminently favoured spirit at the right time takes
possession of; which seems, as it were, to have been waiting for <i>him;</i> and which, when he has
come and mounted the ascent, seems to keep and guard him to the last as its own right man.
In the sentiments which he expresses, in the topics of his discourses, and in the manner of
expression, Isaiah uniformly reveals himself as the kingly prophet.</p>

<p>In reference to the last-named point, it cannot be said that his method of elaborating
thought is elaborate and artificial: it rather shows a lofty simplicity and an unconcern about
external attractiveness, abandoning itself freely to the leading and requirement of each several
thought; but, nevertheless, it always rolls along in a full stream which overpowers all resistance,
and never fails at the right place to accomplish at every turn its object without toil or
effort.</p>

<p>The progress and development of the discourse is always majestic, achieving much with
few words, which, though short, are yet clear and transparent; an overflowing fulness of
thought, which might readily lose itself in the vast and indefinite, but which always at the
right time with tight rein collects and tempers its exuberance; to the bottom exhausting the
thought and completing the utterance, and yet never too diffuse. This severe self-control is
the most admirably seen in those shorter utterances which by briefly-sketched images and
thoughts give us the vague apprehension of something infinite, whilst, nevertheless, they stand
before us complete in themselves and clearly delineated; <i>e.g.</i>, viii.&nbsp;6&mdash;ix.&nbsp;6,
xiv.&nbsp;23&ndash;32, xviii.&nbsp;1&ndash;7,
xxi.&nbsp;11, 12; while in the long piece, xxviii.&ndash;xxxii., if the composition here and there for
a moment languishes, it is only to lift itself again afresh with all the greater might. In
this rich and thickly-crowded fulness of thought and word it is but seldom that the simile
which is employed appears apart, to set forth and complete itself (xxxi.&nbsp;4, 5); in general, it
crowds into the delineation of the object which it is meant to illustrate, and is swallowed up in
it,&mdash;ay, and frequently simile after simile; and yet the many threads of the discourse, which
for a moment appeared ravelled together, soon disentangle themselves into perfect clearness;&mdash;a
characteristic which belongs to this prophet alone, a freedom of language which with no one
else so easily succeeds.</p>

<p>The versification, in like manner, is always full, and yet strongly marked: while, however,
this prophet is so little concerned about anxiously weighing out to each verse its proper number
of words, not unfrequently he repeats the same word in two members (xxxi.&nbsp;8, xxxii.&nbsp;17,
xi.&nbsp;5, xix.&nbsp;13), as if, with so much power and beauty in the matter within, he did not so much
require a painstaking finish in the outside. The structure of the strophe is always easy and
beautifully rounded.</p>

<p>Still the main point lies here,&mdash;that we cannot in the case of Isaiah, as in that of other
prophets, specify any particular peculiarity, or any favourite colour as attaching to his general
style. <i>He is not the especially lyrical prophet, or the especially elegiacal prophet, or the especially
oratorical and hortatory prophet, as we should describe a Joel, a Hosea, a Micah, with whom there
is a greater prevalence of some particular colour; but, just as the subject requires, he has readily
at command every several kind of style and every several change of delineation; and it is precisely
this that, in point of language, establishes his greatness, as well as in general, forms out of
his most towering points of excellence.</i> His only fundamental peculiarity is the lofty, majestic,
calmness of his style, proceeding out of the perfect command which he feels he possesses over
his subject matter. This calmness, however, no way demands that the strain shall not, when
occasion required, be more vehemently excited, and assail the hearer with mightier blows; but
even the extremest excitement, which does here and there intervene, is in the main bridled
still by the same spirit of calmness, and, not overstepping the limits which that spirit assigns,
it soon with lofty self-control returns to its wonted tone of equability
(ii.&nbsp;10&mdash;iii.&nbsp;1, xxviii.&nbsp;11&ndash;23,
xxix.&nbsp;9&ndash;14). Neither does this calmness in discourse require that the subject shall
always be treated only in a plain level way, without any variation of form; rather, Isaiah shows
himself master in just that variety of manner which suits the relation in which his hearers
stand to the matter now in hand. If he wishes to bring home to their minds a distant truth
which they like not to hear, and to judge them by a sentence pronounced by their own mouth,
he retreats into a popular statement of a case drawn from ordinary life (v.&nbsp;1&ndash;6, xxviii.&nbsp;23&ndash;20).
If he will draw the attention of the over wise to some new truth, or to some future prospect,
he surprises them by a brief oracle clothed in an enigmatical dress, leaving it to their penetration
to discover its solution (vii.&nbsp;14&ndash;16, xxix.&nbsp;1&ndash;8). When the unhappy temper of the people&rsquo;s minds
which nothing can amend leads to loud lamentation, his speech becomes for a while the strain
of elegy and lament (i.&nbsp;21&ndash;23, xxii.&nbsp;4, 5). Do the frivolous leaders of the people mock? he
outdoes them at their own weapons, and crushes them under the fearful earnest of divine
mockery (xxviii.&nbsp;10&ndash;13). Even a single ironical word in passing will drop from the lofty prophet
(xxvii.&nbsp;3, <i>glory</i>). Thus his discourse varies into every complexion: <i>it is tender and stern,
didactic and threatening, mourning and again exulting in divine joy, mocking and earnest;</i> but
ever at the right time it returns to its original elevation and repose, and never loses the clear
ground-colour of its divine seriousness.&mdash;<i>Ewald, quoted in Smith&rsquo;s Dictionary of the Bible,</i> vol.
i. pp. 888, 889, article <span class="smcap">Isaiah.</span></p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="p3">[p.&nbsp;3]</span></p>
<div class="footnote" id="intro_fn2"><p><a href="#intro_fna2"><span class="label">[2]</span></a>
The title of the book is <i>&ldquo;The</i> <span class="smcap">vision</span> <i>of Isaiah,&rdquo;</i> which suggests these remarks&mdash;</p>

<p>(1.) Being a <i>vision,</i> it will frequently speak of events that are yet future, as if they had
already occurred. So in iii.&nbsp;8: &ldquo;Jerusalem <i>is ruined;</i> Judah <i>is fallen.&rdquo;</i> In v.&nbsp;13: &ldquo;Therefore
my people <i>are gone into captivity.</i>&rdquo;</p>

<p>(2.) What is seen in vision must be subject to the laws of <i>perspective.</i> One who views the
snowy Alps from a distance may see two mountain peaks, which really are many miles apart,
as one object. The illustration is imperfect; yet it may serve to explain how, to the eye of a
seer, a nearer event may be blended with one that is <i>in the same direction, but vastly more
remote;</i> the type, for instance, melting into the antitype, or the interval between the first and
second advents of the Messiah being indiscernible.</p>

<p>(3.) It is, as a whole, <i>The Vision;</i>&mdash;<i>one</i> vision. It consists, indeed, of various parts; yet
from the very outset these represent the same <i>vision.</i> Judah <i>is rebellious; is sentenced to exile;
is redeemed; is purified. These elements, on a large scale, compose the book as a whole;</i> and, on
a smaller scale, they compose the first chapter. The body is made up of portions similar in
quality to itself, and to each other. The visions are greatly diversified in size, form, colouring,
and other detail; but in essential characteristics it is one vision.&mdash;<i>Dr. Kay, in The Speaker&rsquo;s
Commentary,</i> vol. v. p. 19.</p></div>

<h3 class="tdc" id="o1"><span class="smcap">The Prophet of the Lord.</span></h3>

<p class="bq">i.&nbsp;1. <i>The vision of Isaiah the son of Amoz, which he saw concerning Judah
and Jerusalem, in the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of
Judah.</i></p>

<p><b>I. The nature of the prophet&rsquo;s endowment:</b>
a &ldquo;vision&rdquo; into the very
heart of things, a power of distinguishing
between the seeming and the
real. <b>II. The sadness and the joy of
the prophet&rsquo;s life:</b> sadness arising from
his &ldquo;vision&rdquo; of human sin (vers. 2&ndash;15);
joy arising from his &ldquo;vision&rdquo; of the
wondrousness of the Divine mercy
(ver. 18).</p>

<p><i>Application.</i>&mdash;1. In these latter days
the prophetic endowment, to a greater
or lesser extent, is possessed by all
God&rsquo;s people (1&nbsp;John ii.&nbsp;20). 2.&nbsp;The
Church should pray that it may be
possessed to the fullest extent by
all who are called to minister in
holy things. Prophets of clear and
penetrating &ldquo;vision&rdquo; are among the
greatest gifts which God can confer
upon the <span class="wsnw">Church.<a id="o1_fna1" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#o1_fn1">[1]</a></span>
3.&nbsp;This great
endowment must be used not merely
for the detection and exposure of
human sin, lest we become cynical and
inhuman, but also for the discovery of
the abounding evidence of the Divine
compassion (as in v.&nbsp;9), that we may
be brought into more perfect sympathy
with Him who hates sin but
desires and seeks to save the sinner.</p>

A preacher who is not in some way a
seer is not a preacher at all. You can never
make people see religious realities by correct
definitions. They will not believe in the
reality of God on the word of a man who
merely demonstrates it to them. You must
see such things yourself if you are going to
help others to see them. This is the secret of
all the preaching that ever was good since
preaching began.&mdash;<i>Beecher.</i></p></div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 class="tdc" id="o2"><span class="smcap">Prophecy the Voice of God.</span></h3>

<p class="bq">i.&nbsp;2. <i>The Lord hath spoken.</i></p>

<p>Thus at the very outset of this
book Divine authority is claimed for
the utterances contained in it. Three
views may be taken of the writings of
the Hebrew prophets. 1.&nbsp;They are
the writings of men who knew they
were uttering that which is false when
they claimed to be messengers of the
Most High. 2.&nbsp;They are the writings
of enthusiasts who mistook the ecstasies
of their excited imaginations for
Divine inspirations. 3.&nbsp;They are the
writings of holy men who were inspired
by the Holy Ghost.</p>

<p>Against the first of these views is
to be set the fact that the whole influence
of the prophets was exerted on
behalf of national righteousness and
individual virtue; that for these
things they suffered; that for these
<span class="pagenum" id="p4">[p.&nbsp;4]</span>
things some of them died. Is it
credible that men who <i>so</i> sought to
promote <i>such</i> ends would begin and
continue their mission with a blasphemous
lie?</p>

<p>Against the second is to be set the
fact that many of their predictions
have been fulfilled&mdash;fulfilled after intervals,
so long, and with such minute
accuracy, that sceptics have sought to
account for such fulfilments by asserting
that the prophecies were written
subsequently to the events to which
they refer; an assertion which the
most competent scholars repel even
with contempt.</p>

<p>There remains then only the third
view; and in support of it may be
urged&mdash;in addition to the <i>conclusive</i>
fact just named&mdash;such considerations
as these: 1.&nbsp;That their conceptions of
God and of human duty are such as
to satisfy the loftiest demands of the
most enlightened reason and the best
instructed conscience. Give examples
(ch. xl.&nbsp;12&ndash;26; lviii.&nbsp;3&ndash;7, &amp;c.)
2.&nbsp;That their conceptions of God and of
human duty have not been surpassed
by those of the sublimest poets or the
ablest philosophers of any subsequent
age. 3.&nbsp;That their sublime conceptions
of God and of human duty, which
still stand as the Alps or Himalaya
of human thought, were given to the
world in an age when, with the exception
only of the prophets and those
who accepted their teaching, the whole
human race was given over to the most
debasing idolatries and superstitions.
4.&nbsp;That the Hebrew prophets stood
out in regard to these conceptions not
only distinct from the men of their
own age, but from the men of their
own nation, from whom they had only
words of rebuke, and against whose
most cherished convictions and steadfast
tendencies they set themselves in
resolute opposition. Give examples
(ch. i.&nbsp;11&ndash;15; lxvi.&nbsp;1, 2, &amp;c.) If due
weight be given to these considerations,
we shall see that there is no escape from
the conclusion that the Hebrew prophets
owed their conceptions of God
and duty to God Himself. They spake
and wrote as they were moved by the
Holy Ghost.</p>

<p>If this be so, then&mdash;1. We should
earnestly study the prophetic utterances.
How mentally as well as morally
debased is the man who is not alert and
concerned to hear and understand what
&ldquo;the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> hath spoken&rdquo;! 2.&nbsp;Such of
their utterances as are predictive should

<p class="bq">i.&nbsp;2&ndash;6. <i>Hear, O heavens, &amp;c.</i></p>

<p>God sometimes speaks to man abruptly;
when this is done, the truth
expressed demands the most profound
attention. In our text the heavens
and the earth are suddenly called to
attend to what is about to be said;
God is charging the human race
with fearful wrongs; the matter at
issue is between the creature and Creator,
child and Parent. Our attention is
called to&mdash;</p>

<p><b>I. The Fatherhood of God.</b> &ldquo;I have
nourished,&rdquo; &amp;c. Divine paternity is a
truth which runs through the whole
Bible, here and there shining out with
resplendent lustre, as in our text. The
fatherhood of God was manifested
towards Israel&mdash;1.&nbsp;In <i>supply.</i> As it
<span class="pagenum" id="p6">[p.&nbsp;6]</span>
affected the Jewish nation this declaration
(I have nourished, &amp;c.) pressed
with tremendous force. Their supplies
were marked by miracle, at least all
the time they were in the wilderness;
and the utterance has weight to-day.
All nature is made to minister to
man&rsquo;s necessities. 2.&nbsp;In <i>guardianship.</i>
&ldquo;Brought up children.&rdquo; This should
have been sufficient to strike the ear
as a thunderclap, seeing how far they
had strayed from Him. Out of a
mean, despised, and enslaved people
He had developed a wealthy, mighty
nation; and His guardianship reaches
to all to-day. 3.&nbsp;In <i>defence.</i> The
early history of these people was one
unbroken chain of Divine interpositions.
From the first day Moses
stood before the king, until they were
fully established in Palestine, God&rsquo;s arm
was stretched out to defend them. The
blood on the door-post, their sea-path,
and the sea-grave of the Egyptians,
together with the hovering cloud in
the wilderness, all speak of strong defence;
and still there are evidences of
defence in the life of every man.</p>

<p><b>II. The wickedness of man.</b> Men
are universally the same; as the father
so is the son, as the Jew so is the
Gentile; and hence in this chapter
we have a true picture of the whole
human family. Let us mark some of
the many features of guilt: 1.&nbsp;<i>Degeneracy.</i>
God bears with weaknesses
and infirmities, but wilful backsliding
He abhors. The Jews were evil-doers;
they went astray from God and all that
was good. It is the wilful sinning of
men that now grieves Him. 2.&nbsp;<i>Insensibility.</i>
Wrong-doing is sure to produce
wrong feeling, or, what is worse,
no feeling at all. A sinful life results
in a dark heart. Here is a people
more insensible of good bestowed than
the stupid ox or more stupid ass; and
there are still persons to be found less
acquainted with the source of their
supplies than the dumb, unconscious
<span class="wsnw">brute.<a id="o4_fna1" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#o4_fn1">[1]</a></span>
3.&nbsp;<i>Defiance.</i> They rebelled
against God. Fear ceased to check
them, and hatred led them to bold,
defiant deeds. The day was to them
as the night, and oppression and murder
were but small sins to be indulged in.
So it is with many to-day; they have
no shame, remorse, or compunction for
sin, openly defying the living God.</p>

<p><b>III. The purpose of Divine chastisement.</b>
No true parent finds any
pleasure in chastising his children,
and any pain inflicted without pure
motives would be an evil. God corrects&mdash;1.&nbsp;<i>To
restrain from Sin.</i> This
explains much that happened to the
Israelites, and also much that transpires
in the history of all men. God
sees the danger, the leaning to wrong,
and with Him prevention is better than
<span class="wsnw">cure.<a id="o4_fna2" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#o4_fn2">[2]</a></span>
2.&nbsp;<i>To show the consequences
of sin.</i> Men profess to be practical,
and wish to be practically dealt with;
hence they say: &ldquo;Words are not
enough; there must be blows.&rdquo; The
transgressor must feel as well as hear,
or he will run mad. God has always
taught men that His laws are more
than mere word-rules; there is force
in them, and he that breaks them
must suffer. 3.&nbsp;<i>To bring to</i>
<span class="wsnw"><i>Himself.</i><a id="o4_fna3" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#o4_fn3">[3]</a></span>
Hence we often hear Him say, &ldquo;Why
will ye be stricken any more?&rdquo; Remonstrance
always precedes the lash
to show His love and tenderness.&mdash;<i>Charles Jupe.</i></p>

The consequences of sin are meant to
warn from sin. The penalty annexed to it
is, in the first instance, corrective, not penal.
Fire burns the child, to teach it one of the truths
of this universe&mdash;the property of fire to burn.
The first time it cuts its hand with a sharp
knife, it has gained a lesson which it will never
<span class="pagenum" id="p7">[p.&nbsp;7]</span>
forget. Now, in the case of pain, this experience
is seldom, if ever, in vain. There is little
chance of a child forgetting that fire will burn,
and that sharp steel will cut; but the moral
lessons contained in the penalties annexed to
wrong-doing are just as truly intended to deter
men from evil, though they are by no means
so unerring in enforcing their application. The
fever, in the veins and the headache which
succeed intoxication are meant to warn against
excess. On the first occasion they are simply
corrective; in every succeeding one they assume
more and more a penal character, in proportion
as the conscience carries with them the
sense of ill-desert.&mdash;<i>F.&nbsp;W. Robertson,</i> 1816&ndash;1853.</p></div>

danger, presently runs to her, casts himself
into her arms, and cries out to be saved and
shielded by her: so we, securely enjoying the
childish sports of worldly prosperity, do so
fondly dote on them that we scarce think of
our Heavenly Father; but when perils and
dangers approach, and are ready to seize upon
us, then we flee to Him, and cast ourselves into
the arms of His protection and providence,
crying and calling to Him by earnest prayer
for help and deliverance in this our extremity

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 class="tdc" id="o5"><span class="smcap">Thoughtlessness.</span></h3>

<p class="bq">i.&nbsp;3. <i>The ox knoweth his owner, and the ass his master&rsquo;s crib: but Israel doth not
know, my people do not consider.</i></p>

<p>It is clear from this chapter that the
Lord views the sin of mankind with
intense regret. Israel in this case is
not so much a type of believers as a
representative of sinners in general.
The greatest difficulty in the world is
to make men think. Consider&mdash;</p>

<p><b>I. The common but serious fault
here condemned.</b> Men are most inconsiderate&mdash;1.&nbsp;Towards
<span class="wsnw">God;<a id="o5_fna1" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#o5_fn1">[1]</a></span>
2.&nbsp;towards their own best
<span class="wsnw">interests;<a id="o5_fna2" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#o5_fn2">[2]</a></span>
3.&nbsp;towards the claims of justice and
<span class="wsnw">gratitude.<a id="o5_fna3" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#o5_fn3">[3]</a></span></p>

<p><b>II. Some things that make the commonness
of this fault surprising.</b>
1.&nbsp;Men live without consideration upon
a matter in regard to which nothing
but consideration will avail. Nothing
can stand in lieu of thoughtfulness in
religion. In regard to other matters
we can employ others to think for us.
But in this matter we must think for
ourselves. Religion is a spiritual business,
and if a man lives and dies refusing
to consider, he has put away from
him all hope of being saved; for grace
comes not into us by mechanical process,
but the Holy Spirit works upon
the mind and soul. 2.&nbsp;This inconsideration
is practised in regard to a
subject the consideration of which
would be abundantly remunerative,
and would lead to the happiest
<span class="wsnw">results.<a id="o5_fna4" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#o5_fn4">[4]</a></span></p>

<p><b>III. Some of the aggravations which
attend it.</b> 1.&nbsp;It is fallen into by those
of whom better things might reasonably
have been expected. &ldquo;<i>Israel</i> doth
not know, <i>my people</i> doth not consider.&rdquo;
It is not the heathen who act
more stupidly than the brutes, but
those whom God has called to Himself,
on whom He has conferred light and
knowledge, &amp;c. 2.&nbsp;They have had
their attention earnestly directed to
the topics which they still neglect.
3.&nbsp;They have also been chastised, in the
gracious endeavour to arouse them
from their thoughtlessness. 4.&nbsp;Many
of them are very zealous in regard to
outward religion, as were those whom
the prophet rebuked. 5.&nbsp;They have
been most earnestly and affectionately
invited to turn to God by gracious
promises (such as ver. 18). 6.&nbsp;They
have ability enough to consider other
things.</p>

<p><b>IV. Some of the secret causes of
this widespread fault.</b> 1.&nbsp;In the case
of many thoughtless persons we must
lay the blame to the sheer <i>frivolity of
their nature</i>. 2.&nbsp;In every case the
bottom reason is <i>opposition to God Himself</i>.
3.&nbsp;Upon some minds the tendency
<span class="pagenum" id="p8">[p.&nbsp;8]</span>
to <i>delay</i> operates fearfully.
4.&nbsp;Some make an excuse for themselves
for not considering eternity, because
<i>they are such eminently practical men</i>.
They are living for realities of the
nature of hard case, and will not be
induced to indulge in fancies and
<span class="wsnw">notions.<a id="o5_fna5" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#o5_fn5">[5]</a></span>
5.&nbsp;Many are <i>prejudiced,</i>
because some Christian professor has
not lived up to his profession, or they
have heard something which is said to
be the doctrine of the gospel of which
they cannot approve. 6.&nbsp;In most
cases men <i>do not like to trouble themselves,</i>
and they have an uncomfortable
suspicion that if they were to look too
narrowly into their affairs, they would
find things far from
<span class="wsnw">healthy.<a id="o5_fna6" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#o5_fn6">[6]</a></span>&mdash;<i>C.&nbsp;H.
Spurgeon, Metropolitan Tabernacle
Pulpit,</i> vol. xviii. pp. 373&ndash;384.</p>

<div class="footnotes"><h4 class="tdc">FOOTNOTES:</h4>
<div class="footnote" id="o5_fn1"><p><a href="#o5_fna1"><span class="label">[1]</span></a>
One would pardon them if they forgot
many minor things, and neglected many inferior
persons; but to be inconsiderate to their
Creator, to their Preserver, to Him in whose
hand their everlasting destiny is placed, this is
a strange folly as well as a great sin. Whoever
a courtier may neglect, he is sure to consider
his king. Men when they start their sons in
business will bid them mind the main chance,
and attend to the principal point, and especially
take care to stand well with such a man
who has the power to help or to ruin them.
Men, as a general rule, are far too ready to
seek the assistance of those who are in power,
and this makes it all the more strange that
the all-powerful God, who lifteth up and
casteth down, should be altogether forgotten,
or, when remembered, should still be dishonoured
by mankind. If it were only because
He is great, and we are so dependent
upon Him, one would have thought that a
rational man would have acquainted himself
with God, and been at peace; but when we
reflect that God is supremely good, kind,
tender, and gracious, as well as great, the
marvel of man&rsquo;s thoughtlessness is much
increased. Every good man desires to be on
good terms with the good; unusual goodness
wins admiration, and an invitation to associate
with the eminently excellent is usually
accepted with pleasure; yet in the case of the
thrice holy God, whose name is Love, it is not
so. All attractions are in the character of
God, and yet man shuns his Maker. If God
were a demon, man could hardly be more cold
towards Him.&mdash;<i>Spurgeon.</i></p></div>

<div class="footnote" id="o5_fn2"><p><a href="#o5_fna2"><span class="label">[2]</span></a>
When we ask men to attend to matters
which do not concern them, we are not astonished
if they plead that they have no time, and
little thought to spare. If I were to address
you upon a matter which affected the interests
of the dwellers in the Dog-star, or had some
relation to the inhabitants of the moon, I
should not marvel if you were to say, &ldquo;Go to
those whom it may concern, and talk to them;
but as for us, the matter is so remote, that we
take no interest in it.&rdquo; But how shall we
account for it that man will not know about
himself, and wilt not consider about his own
soul? Any trifle will attract him, but he will
not consider his own immortality, or meditate
upon the joy or the misery that must be his
portion. It is in very truth a miracle of
human depravity&mdash;what if I say insanity&mdash;that
man should be unmindful of his best self.&mdash;<i>Spurgeon.</i></p></div>

<div class="footnote" id="o5_fn3"><p><a href="#o5_fna3"><span class="label">[3]</span></a>
I have known men who have said, &ldquo;Let
the heavens fall, but let justice be done:&rdquo; and
they have scorned in their dealings with their
fellow-men to take any unrighteous advantage,
even though it were as little as the turning of
a hair. I have known some also who, if they
were called ungrateful, would indignantly
spurn the charge. They would count themselves
utterly loathsome if they did not return
good to those who have done them good; and
yet it may be these very same persons have
been throughout life unjust towards God, and
ungrateful towards Him to whom they owe
their being, and all that makes it endurable.
The service, the thankfulness, the love
which are due to Him, they have withheld.&mdash;<i>Spurgeon.</i></p></div>

<div class="footnote" id="o5_fn4"><p><a href="#o5_fna4"><span class="label">[4]</span></a>
We should not marvel at men if they
would not think upon topics which made them
unhappy; but albeit there are some who have
suffered frightful depression of spirits in connection
with true religion, yet its general and
ultimate fruit has ever been peace and joy
through believing in Christ Jesus, and even
the exceptions could be easily accounted for.
In some melancholy spirits their godliness is
too shallow to make them happy; they breathe
so little of the heavenly air that they are
distressed for want of more. In others the
sorrow occasioned by gracious reflection is but
a preliminary and passing stage of grace;
there must be a ploughing before there can be a
harvest; there must be medicine for the
disease before health returns, and the newly-awakened
are just in the stage and the condition
of drinking bitter medicine. This will
soon be over, and the results will be most
admirable. A great cloud of witnesses, among
whom we joyfully take our place, bear witness
to the fact that the ways of the Lord are
ways of pleasantness. Our deepest joy lies
now in knowing God, and considering Him.&mdash;<i>Spurgeon.</i></p></div>

<div class="footnote" id="o5_fn5"><p><a href="#o5_fna5"><span class="label">[5]</span></a>
I only wish that those who profess to be
practical were more nearly so, for a practical
man will always take more care of his body
than of his coat, certainly; then should he not
take more care of his soul than of the body,
which is but the garment of it? If he were a
truly practical man, he would do that. A
<span class="pagenum" id="p9">[p.&nbsp;9]</span>
practical man will always consider matters in
due proportion; he will not give all his mind
to a cricket-match and neglect his business.
And yet how often your practical man still
more greatly errs; he devotes all his time to
money-making, and not a minute to the salvation
of his soul, and its preparation for
eternity! Is this practical? Why, sir, Bedlam
itself is guilty of no worse madness than that!
There is not in all your wards a single maniac
who commits a more manifest act of insanity
than a man who spends all his force upon this
fleeting life, and lets the eternal future go by
the board.&mdash;<i>Spurgeon.</i></p></div>

<div class="footnote" id="o5_fn6"><p><a href="#o5_fna6"><span class="label">[6]</span></a>
They are like the bankrupt before the
court the other day who did not keep books.
Not he. He did not know how his affairs
stood, and, moreover, he did not want to know;
he did not like his books, and his books did
not like him. He was going to the bad, and
he therefore tried to forget it. They say of
the silly ostrich that when she hides her head
in the sand, and does not see her pursuers, she
thinks she is safe; that is the policy of many
men. They spread their sails, and get up the
steam, and go with double speed straight
ahead. What, not look at the chart! No,
they do not want to know whether there are
rocks and breakers ahead. Arrest that captain,
put him in irons, and find a sane man
to take charge of the vessel. Oh for grace
to arrest that folly which is the captain of
your bark, and put sound sense in command,
or else a spiritual shipwreck is certain.&mdash;<i>Spurgeon.</i></p></div>

Silly man is like the foolish chickens,
though the kite comes and takes away many
of their fellows, yet the rest continue pecking
the ground, never heeding their owner, never
minding their shelter. Death comes and
snatches away one man here, a second there;
one before them, another behind them, and
they are killed by death, undone for ever; yet
they who survive take no warning, but persist
in their wicked, ungodly ways (Job. iv.&nbsp;20, 21).&mdash;<i>Swinnock,</i> 1673.</p>

<p>A plough is coming from the far end of a
long field, and a daisy stands nodding, and full
of dew-dimples. That furrow is sure to strike
the daisy. It casts its shadow as gaily, and
exhales its gentle breath as freely, and stands
as simple and radiant and expectant as ever;
and yet that crushing furrow, which is turning
and turning others in its course, is drawing
near, and in a moment it whirls the heedless
flower with sudden reversal under the
sod! And as is the daisy, with no power of
thought, so are ten thousand thinking sentient
flowers of life, blossoming in places of peril,
and yet thinking that no furrow of disaster is
running in toward them&mdash;that no iron plough
of trouble is about to overturn them. Sometimes
it dimly dawns upon us, when we see
other men&rsquo;s mischiefs and wrongs, that we are
in the same category with them, and that perhaps
the storms which have overtaken them
will overtake us also. But it is only for a
moment, for we are artful to cover the ear,
and not listen to the voice that warns us of
danger.&mdash;<i>Beecher.</i></p></div>

<p class="bq">i.&nbsp;3. <i>My people doth not consider.</i></p>

<p>The universe is regulated by fixed
laws, by which God preserves and
governs all things. Man is endowed
with rational powers, intellectual faculties,
capable of apprehending these
laws, whether they become known to
him by revelation or by his own discoveries,
and of using them as his
guides. His well-being depends upon
his harmony with them, and his
dignity and bliss on the right application
of his mental powers. One of
Satan&rsquo;s main stratagems is to endeavour
to hinder him from using them
aright; to induce him to act without
forethought or reflection, and to incite
him to act merely on impulse, feeling,
or <span class="wsnw">passion.<a id="o7_fna1" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#o7_fn1">[1]</a></span>
As a result of these
artifices, the great mass of mankind
live without thought, and are borne in
stupid insensibility to the eternal
world. Thus God complains of the
infatuation of Israel, &ldquo;My people doth
not consider.&rdquo; To consider is to think
deliberately, to reflect maturely. There
are many subjects to which our consideration
should be attentively and
diligently given. We should consider&mdash;<b>I.&nbsp;The
character and will of God.</b>
His <i>words</i> should lead us to this. If
you see a beautiful picture, or piece of
sculpture or mechanism, you naturally
direct your thoughts to the artist
or mechanist who has produced it.
The grandeur of the divine works
surrounds you, and ought you not to
consider the wondrous Architect of the
whole? His <i>relationship to you</i> should
induce it. Your existence is derived
from Him, and He fashioned you, and
bestowed on you all your endowments.
He is your Father, your bountiful Preserver.
Besides, you are ever in His
hand, ever before His eyes, He surrounds
you. And He is great, wise,
powerful, holy, and just. His love
and favour are heaven; His anger and
frowns are hell. <b>II.&nbsp;Ourselves.</b> What
are we? What our powers? our capabilities?
our end and destination? the
claims of God? our duties to others?
the improvement we should make of
the present? the preparation we should
make for the future? Are we answering
the end of our being? &amp;c. <b>III.&nbsp;Our
spiritual state before God.</b> Is it
one of ignorance, or of knowledge?
folly, or wisdom? guilt, or pardon?
condemnation or acceptance? alienation,
or sonship and adoption? safety,
or imminent peril? Are we heirs of
wrath or perdition, or of God and
salvation? <b>IV.&nbsp;The importance of
life.</b> Life is the seedtime for eternity,
the period of probation, the only opportunity
of securing eternal blessedness.
How short it is, how fragile,
how uncertain! How criminal to
waste it, to pervert it! &amp;c. <b>V.&nbsp;The
solemnities of death</b> (Deut. xxxii.&nbsp;29).
Consider its certainty, its probable
nearness, its truly awful character.
Try to realise it. Consider if you
were now dying, <span class="wsnw">&amp;c.<a id="o7_fna2" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#o7_fn2">[2]</a></span>
<b>VI.&nbsp;The
great concerns of eternity.</b> The judgment-day.
Heaven, with its eternal
glories; hell, with its everlasting
horrors. Eternity itself, how solemn,
how overwhelming! How blissful to
the saint! how terrific to the sinner!
<span class="smcap">Eternity!</span> <b>VII.&nbsp;That salvation which
will fit us for living, dying, and for
eternity.</b> Provided by the mercy
of God, obtained by the Lord
Jesus Christ, revealed in the gospel,
offered to every sinner, received by
simple faith, and which delivers from
guilt, pollution, fear, and everlasting
wrath. <b>VIII.&nbsp;Our present duty and
interest.</b> Men are supposed to care
naturally for these. But their care
usually relates merely to the body,
and the things of time. Consider
whether it is not your <i>duty</i> to obey and
serve God; whether it is not your <i>interest</i>
(1&nbsp;Tim. iv.&nbsp;8). <b>IX.&nbsp;That there is
no substitute for religion</b> (Jer. ii.&nbsp;13).</p>

<p><i>Application.</i>&mdash;Urge consideration
upon all present. 1.&nbsp;<i>Some have
never considered.</i> Now begin. Retire
<span class="pagenum" id="p11">[p.&nbsp;11]</span>
and reflect; weigh and consider these
things. 2.&nbsp;<i>Some have considered occasionally</i>&mdash;in
church, or when sick, in

the <i>habit</i> of
<span class="wsnw">consideration,<a id="o7_fna3" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#o7_fn3">[3]</a></span> and

Satan doth his utmost, that sinners may
not have any serious thoughts of the miserable
state they are in while they are under his
rule, or hear of anything from others which
might the least unsettle their minds from his
service. Consideration, he knows, is the first
step to repentance. He that doth not consider
his ways what they are, and whither they lead
him, is not likely to change them in haste.
Israel stirred not until Moses came, and had
some discourse with them about their woful
slavery and the gracious thoughts of God towards
them, and then they begin to desire to be
gone. Pharaoh soon bethought him what consequence
might follow upon him, and cunningly
labours to prevent it by doubling their
task. &ldquo;Ye are idle, ye are idle, therefore ye
say, Let us go, and do sacrifice unto the Lord.
Go therefore and work.&rdquo; Thus Satan is very
jealous of the sinner, afraid every Christian
that speaks to him, or ordinance that he hears,
will inveigle him. By his good-will he should
come at neither; no, nor have a thought of
heaven or hell from one end of the week to
the other, and that he may have as few as may
be, he keeps him full-handed with work. The
sinner grinds, and he is filling the hopper that
the mill may not stand still. Ah, poor wretch!
was ever slave so looked to? As long as the
devil can keep thee thus, thou art his own sure
enough. The prodigal &ldquo;came to himself&rdquo;
before he came to his father. He considered
with himself what a starving condition he was
in; his husks were poor meat, and yet he had
not enough of them; and how easily he might
mend his commons if he had but grace to go
home and humble himself to his father! Now,
and not till now, he goes.&mdash;<i>Gurnall,</i> 1616&ndash;1679.</p></div>

No man is in so much danger as he who
thinks there is no danger. Why, when the
bell rings, when the watchman rends the air
with cries of &ldquo;Fire! <i>Fire!</i> <span class="smcap">Fire!</span>&rdquo; when
in every direction there is the pattering of feet
on the sidewalk, and when the engines come
rattling up to the burning house, one after
another the inmates are awakened, and they
rush out; and they are safest that are most
terrified, and that suffer most from a sense of
danger. One only remains behind. He hears
the tumult, but it weaves itself into the shape
of dreams, and he seems to be listening to
some parade, and soon the sounds begin to be
indistinct in his ear, and at length they cease
to make any impression upon him. During
all this time he is inhaling the deadly gas with
which his apartment has become filled, gradually
his senses are benumbed, and finally he
is rendered unconscious by suffocation. And,
in the midst of peril, and the thunder of
excitement, that man who is the least awake,
and the least frightened, is the very man
that is most likely to be burned up.&mdash;<i>Beecher.</i></p></div>

<h3 class="tdc" id="o8"><span class="smcap">Religious Consideration.</span></h3>

<p class="bq">i.&nbsp;3. <i>My people doth not consider.</i></p>

<p>In a former discourse we noticed
that one of Satan&rsquo;s chief devices was
to keep men from consideration, and
we referred to a variety of subjects
upon which it is important that we
should reflect. We now call your
attention to <i>the true character of religious
consideration.</i></p>

<p><b>I. It should be serious and earnest.</b>
The subjects are too solemn and
<span class="pagenum" id="p12">[p.&nbsp;12]</span>
weighty to be hastily dismissed. It
must not be a mere cursory survey, a
rapid glance at these great concerns,
but a careful, deliberate contemplation
of them; just as a prisoner about to
be tried for a capital offence would
consider his defence, or a wrecked
mariner how he shall escape a watery
grave, or a traveller how to accomplish
some momentous journey or voyage.
If it be done lightly and hastily, it
will not profit us or please God.
<b>II.&nbsp;It should be prayerful.</b> The exercise
will be irksome to the natural
heart. We shall be disposed to give
it up, or do it slightingly. The grace
of God alone can give the spirit necessary
for the right discharge of it.
Therefore begin, continue, and follow
it out with prayer. <b>III.&nbsp;It should be
pursued in connection with a diligent
use of the public means of grace.</b>
Hearken to the Divine Word as it is
read in the sanctuary, and to the
preaching of the gospel, Christian
conversation, &amp;c. Consideration will
not profit us if God&rsquo;s means and
ordinances are neglected. All are
needful to the soul, as wind, sun, rain,
and dew are all needful to the ripening
of fruit. <b>IV.&nbsp;It should be continued
and persevering.</b> Not too much to
devote a portion of every day to it.
The first and last moments would be
thus profitably <span class="wsnw">exercised,<a id="o8_fna1" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#o8_fn1">[1]</a></span>
<i>and it must be followed</i>
<span class="wsnw"><i>out.</i><a id="o8_fna2" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#o8_fn2">[2]</a></span></p>

<p>In conclusion, notice <b>some reasons
why you should consider.</b> 1.&nbsp;<i>Because
you have powers to do so.</i> God made
you for this end, that you should
consider. In neglecting this, you
despise your own souls, you sink to
below the level of the brute creation.
They do answer the end of their existence,
and obey their several instincts.
&ldquo;The ox knoweth his owner.&rdquo; Nearly
every creature disposes of its time and
means wisely; but an inconsiderate
man defaces the faculties within him.
2.&nbsp;<i>Because it is your duty.</i> God enjoins
it&mdash;He urges, expostulates. To neglect
it is, therefore, to despise God and
rebel against Him. 3.&nbsp;<i>It is essential to
the possession of true religion.</i> Various
are the ways in which God brings
man to Himself; by a variety of instruments
and means, but none without
consideration. Manasseh in prison&mdash;Jonah
in the belly of the whale&mdash;the
prodigal in his misery, &amp;c. It is the
first great step towards saving religion.
4.&nbsp;<i>By prudent men, it is never neglected
in worldly things.</i> In entering upon
any contract, in buying and selling, in
all business engagements, in all secular
pursuits. We consider, in reference to
the body, our houses, food, and raiment,
our families, &amp;c. Are the soul&rsquo;s eternal
concerns the only things not deserving
of it? 5.&nbsp;<i>God may compel you to consider.</i>
By bereaving you of the dearest
objects of your hearts, by afflicting
your bodies, by embittering all earthly
good. Is it not better to avoid these
corrections, sorrows, and griefs?
6.&nbsp;<i>You may consider when it is too late.</i>
Perhaps on the verge of eternity, if
not in eternity itself. The foolish
virgins considered when the cry was
heard: the rich man considered too
late; the wicked will consider in the
great day of Christ&rsquo;s wrath, when they
cry to the rocks and hills, &amp;c. The
consideration of the lost in eternity
will be in vain&mdash;will be bitter beyond
description&mdash;will be everlasting, and
as horrible as it is durable. Therefore,
consider <i>now,</i> while consideration may
yet profit you.&mdash;<i>Jabez Burns, D.D., Pulpit
Cyclop&aelig;dia,</i> vol. ii. pp. 37&ndash;39.</p>

Make up your spiritual accounts daily;
see how matters stand between God and your
souls (Ps. lxxvii.&nbsp;6). Often reckonings keep
God and conscience friends. Do with your
heart as you do with your watch&mdash;wind it up
every morning by prayer, and at night examine
whether it has gone true all that day, whether
the wheels of your affections have moved
swiftly toward heaven. Oh call yourself often
to account; keep your reckonings even, and
that is the way to keep your peace.&mdash;<i>Waters,</i>

The end of all arts and sciences is the
practice of them. And as this is to be confessed
in all other arts, so it cannot be denied
in divinity and religion, the practice whereof
doth in excellency surmount the knowledge
and theory, as being the main end whereunto
it tends. For to what purpose do men spend
their spirits and tire their wits in discerning
the light of truth, if they do not use the benefit
of it to direct them in all their ways? (Ps. cxix.&nbsp;59.)&mdash;<i>Downame,</i>

<h3 class="tdc" id="o9"><span class="smcap">Iniquity a Burden.</span></h3>

<p class="bq">i.&nbsp;4. <i>A people laden with iniquity.</i></p>

<p><i>A very surprising description:</i> &ldquo;A
people laden with <i>iniquity.</i>&rdquo; On account
of their punctilious and costly
observance of the Mosaic ritual (see
vers.&nbsp;11&ndash;15), the Jews imagined that
they deserved the commendation of
Heaven; but God pronounced them
to be &ldquo;a people laden with iniquity.&rdquo;
<i>Men</i> often form very different estimates
of the same thing; <i>e.g.,</i> buyer and seller
(Prov. xx.&nbsp;14). There is often as
marked a difference between the divine
and human estimates of character (Luke
xviii.&nbsp;11; Rev. iii.&nbsp;17). This is so
because God and men judge by different
standards; men take into account only
their occasional good actions; God
judges by that feature of their character
which is <span class="wsnw">predominant.<a id="o9_fna1" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#o9_fn1">[1]</a></span> So
judging, He condemned these most
&ldquo;religious&rdquo; Jews. What is His estimate
of <i>us?</i></p>

<p><i>A very instructive description:</i> &ldquo;A
people <i>laden</i> with iniquity.&rdquo; The conception
is that of a nation that has
gone on adding sin to sin, as a man
gathering sticks in the forest adds
fagot to fagot, until he staggers beneath
the load; that which was eagerly sought
after becomes an oppressive burden.
How true this is! There are many
national burdens; despotism, an incapable
government, excessive taxation,
&amp;c., but the worst and most oppressive
of all is a nation&rsquo;s iniquities.</p>

<p>The iniquities of a nation constitute
a burden that impede it&mdash;1.&nbsp;<i>In its pursuit
of material prosperity.</i> With what
desperate intensity this English nation
toils! and for what end? Chiefly that
it may accumulate wealth. How greatly
it is impeded in this pursuit by its
costly government! But how much
more by its costly vices! On strong
drink alone this nation expends a
larger sum than the whole amount both
of imperial and local taxation&mdash;more
than one hundred millions annually!
Other vices that are nameless, how
much they cost, and what a hindrance
they are to the nation in its pursuit of
wealth! 2.&nbsp;<i>In its pursuit of social
happiness.</i> What a crushing burden of
sorrow the nation&rsquo;s iniquities impose
upon it! 3.&nbsp;<i>In its pursuit of moral
and intellectual improvement.</i> According
to a monkish legend, the church of
St. Brannock&rsquo;s, in Braunton, Devon,
could not be erected on its original
site, because as fast as the builders
reared up the walls by day, by night
the stones were carried away by invisible
hands. A like contest goes
on in our own land. The nation&rsquo;s
virtues are toiling to elevate the
national character morally and intellectually,
using as their instruments
the school, the church, the press; but
as fast as the virtues build, the vices
pull down. In all these respects the
nation&rsquo;s iniquities constitute its heaviest
burden.</p>

<p><i>Consequently,</i> 1. To give a legal sanction
to vices, or to connive at what
promotes them, for the sake of certain
additions to the national revenues, is
suicidal folly of the grossest kind.
2.&nbsp;Those are the truest national benefactors
who do most to abate the
national iniquities. The palm for
truest patriotism must be awarded, not
to &ldquo;active politicians,&rdquo; but to faithful
preachers, Sunday-school teachers, temperance
reformers, &amp;c. 3.&nbsp;Vices of all
kinds should be branded, not only as
sins against God, but as treasons against
society; and all good men should, in
self-defence, as well as in a spirit of
enlightened patriotism, band themselves
together for their overthrow.
That is a mistaken spirituality which
leads some good men to leave imperial
and local affairs in the hands
of the worldly and the vicious. We
are bound to labour as well as to pray
that God&rsquo;s will may be done &ldquo;on earth
as it is in heaven,&rdquo; and that &ldquo;His
kingdom&rdquo; may come in our own
<span class="wsnw">land.<a id="o9_fna2" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#o9_fn2">[2]</a></span></p>

<p>That which is true of nations is
<span class="pagenum" id="p14">[p.&nbsp;14]</span>
true also of individuals; the heaviest
burdens which men can take upon
themselves are vices. Vices lay upon
men a burden&mdash;1.&nbsp;<i>Of expense.</i> Even
so-called &ldquo;indulgences&rdquo; are costly;
many professing Christians spend more
annually on tobacco than they give to
the cause of missions. Vices keep
millions poor all their <span class="wsnw">lives.<a id="o9_fna3" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#o9_fn3">[3]</a></span>
2.&nbsp;<i>Of discredit.</i> 3.&nbsp;<i>Of sorrow,</i> clouding all
the present. 4.&nbsp;<i>Of fear,</i> darkening all
the future.</p>

<p>There is this terrific feature about
the burden of iniquity&mdash;there is none
so hard to be got rid of. It is hard to
inspire a nation or a man with the
desire to get rid of it. How nations
and men hug their vices, notwithstanding
the miseries they entail! It is
still harder to accomplish the desire!
Society is full of men who stagger and
groan under this burden, from which
they strive in vain to free themselves.
In them the fable of Sinbad, unable to
rid himself of the old man who he
has taken upon his shoulders, has a
melancholy realisation. These men
feel themselves to be helpless, and
their case would indeed be hopeless
were it not that God has laid help for
us on One who is mighty to save. Cry
to Him, ye burdened ones, and obtain
release!</p>

Men are to be estimated, as Johnson says,
by the mass of character. A block of tin may
have a grain of silver, but still it is tin; and
a block of silver may have an alloy of tin, but
still it is silver. The mass of Elijah&rsquo;s character
was excellence; yet he was not without the
alloy. The mass of Jehu&rsquo;s character was base;
yet he had a portion of zeal which was directed
by God to great ends.&mdash;<i>Cecil.</i></p></div>

As Christians are to think of living for
awhile in the world, it is not unreasonable for
them to be affected with its occurrences and
changes. Some plead for a kind of abstracted
and sublimated devotion, which the circumstances
they are placed in by their Creator
render equally impractical and absurd. They
are never to notice the affairs of government,
or the measures of administration; war, or
peace; liberty, or slavery; plenty, or scarcity,&mdash;all
is to be equally indifferent to them; they
are to leave these carnal and worldly things to
others. But have they not bodies? Have they
not families? Is religion founded on the ruins
of humanity? When a man becomes a Christian,
does he cease to be a member of civil
society? Allowing that he be not the owner
of the ship, but only a passenger in it, has he
nothing to awaken his concern in the voyage?
If he be only a traveller towards a better
country, is he to be told that because he is at
an inn which he is soon to leave, it should not
excite any emotion in him whether it be invaded
by robbers or consumed by flames before
the morning? In the peace thereof ye shall
have peace; and are not Christians to provide
things honest in the sight of all men? Are
they to detach themselves while here from the
interests of their fellow-creatures; or to rejoice
with them that rejoice, and weep with them
that weep? Is our religion various affected
by public transactions? Can a Christian, for
instance, be indifferent to the cause of freedom,
even on a pious principle? Does not civil
liberty necessarily include religion? and is it
not necessary to the exertions of ministers,
and the spreading of the gospel?&mdash;<i>Jay.</i></p></div>

As colour and favour, and proportion of
hair and face and lineament, and as disease
and infirmities of the body, so, commonly, the
liabilities and dispositions and tempers of the
mind and affections become hereditary, and
run in the blood. An evil bird hatches an
evil egg, and one viper will breed a generation
of vipers. Most sins pass along from the
father to the son, and so downward, by a kind
of lineal descent, from predecessors to posterity,
and that for the most part with advantage
and increase, whole families being tainted
with the special vices of their stock. John
the Baptist speaks of &ldquo;a generation of vipers;&rdquo;
and if we should but observe the condition of
some families in a long line of succession,
might we not espy here and there even whole
generations of drunkards, and generations of
swearers, and generations of idolaters, and
generations of worldlings, and generations of
seditious, and of envious, and of riotous, and
of haughty, and of unclean persons, and of
sinners in other kinds.&mdash;<i>Sanderson,</i> 1587&ndash;1662.</p>

<p>Original or birth sin is not merely a doctrine
in religion, it is a fact in man&rsquo;s world acknowledged
by all, whether religious or not. Let
a man be providing for an unborn child: in
case of distribution of worldly property, he will
take care to bind him by conditions and covenants
which shall guard against his fraudulently
helping himself to that which he is to
hold for or to apportion to another. He never
saw that child; he does not know but that
child may be the most pure and perfect of
men; but he knows it will not be safe to put
temptation in his way, because he knows he
will be born in sin, and liable to sin, and sure
to commit sin.&mdash;<i>Alford,</i> 1810&ndash;1871.</p></div>

<div class="footnote" id="o10_fn2"><p><a href="#o10_fna2"><span class="label">[2]</span></a>
While children are the children of
Christian parents, as <i>they</i> were children of
Christian parents, the presumptions are that
they will turn out right; not without parental
training, but, that being implied, the presumptions
are that they will, by the force of
natural law, tend in that direction. All the
presumptions are that the children of moral
and sensible parents will become moral
and sensible. Only the grossest neglect and the
most culpable exposure to temptation will
overrule the presumption and likelihood that
the children of good parents will be good.
There may be opposing influences; there may
be temptations and perversions that shall interrupt
the natural course of things; but this
does not invalidate the truth that there is a
great law by which like produces like. And I
say that under this law the Christian parent
has a right to this comforting presumption&mdash;&ldquo;My
children have all the chances in their
favour by reason of the moral constitution
which they have inherited.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I know multitudes of families in which the
moral element is hereditary; and it is not
surprising that the children of these families
are moral. Moral qualities are as transmissible
as mental traits or physical traits. The same
principle applies to every part of the human
constitution. And where families have been
from generation to generation God-fearing,
passion-restraining, truth-telling, and conscience-obeying,
the chances are ninety-nine
in every hundred in favour of the children.&mdash;<i>Beecher.</i></p></div>

<h3 class="tdc" id="o11"><span class="smcap">Forsaking the Lord.</span></h3>

<p class="bq">i.&nbsp;4. <i>They have forsaken the Lord.</i></p>

<p>How many souls are guilty of forsaking
the Lord? They forsake Him
by yielding to what are called &ldquo;little
<span class="wsnw">sins.&rdquo;<a id="o11_fna1" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#o11_fn1">[1]</a></span>
Then they are further removed
from Him by habitual wickedness.</p>

<p><b>I. This conduct is surprising.</b> Is it
not most surprising that men should
forsake the great God, their Creator
and Benefactor? He is all-powerful.
He is all-wise. He is all-loving. The
soul cannot have a better helper in
difficulty, or a truer and wiser friend
in sorrow. From the Godward aspect
of the case nothing is more surprising
than that men should forsake God;
but from the manward aspect of things
this is not surprising, for man is carnal,
and the carnal mind is enmity against
God. Satan draws the soul from God.
It chases a phantom into the great
darkness, and finds in the end that it
has wandered from the Infinite Being.</p>

<p><b>II. This conduct is criminal.</b> We
should esteem it criminal to forsake a
parent, to forsake a benefactor, to forsake
a master. But this offence is
small compared to that of the soul
when it wanders from the Lord. It
exhibits <i>insubordination.</i> It rejects the
Supreme Moral Ruler of the universe.
It exhibits <i>ingratitude.</i> It forsakes its
Redeemer. It exhibits <i>folly,</i> for away
from Christ the soul cannot obtain true
rest.</p>

<p><b>III. This conduct is inexcusable.</b>
The soul can give no true reason, or
valid excuse, for such unholy conduct.
<span class="pagenum" id="p16">[p.&nbsp;16]</span>
The Lord has dealt bountifully with it,
and therefore it has no ground of
complaint. He is attractive in character.
He is winning in disposition.
He is kindly in the discipline of life.
He gives holy influences to draw the
soul to Himself. Hence man has no
excuse for forsaking God.</p>

<p><b>IV. This conduct is common.</b> The
world of humanity has forsaken God.
One by one souls are returning, and
are being welcomed to Christ and to
heaven. Many agencies are at work
for the return of souls to the heavenly
kingdom. Let us seek to make them
efficient. Let us pray that they may
be successful. Have you forsaken
God?&mdash;<i>J.&nbsp;S. Exell.</i></p>

There is many a man who evinces, for a
time, a steadfast attention to religion, walking
with all care in the path of God&rsquo;s commandments,
&amp;c., but who, after awhile, declines
from spirituality, and is dead, though he may
yet have a name to life. But how does it
commonly happen that such a man falls away
from the struggle for salvation? Is it ordinarily
through some one powerful and undisguised
assault that he is turned from the faith,
or over one huge obstacle that he falls not to
rise again? Not so. It is almost invariably
through little things. He fails to take notice
of little things, and they accumulate into great.
He allows himself in little things, and thus
forms a strong habit. He relaxes in little
things, and thus in time loosens every bond.
Because it is a little thing, he counts it of little
moment, utterly forgetting that millions are
made up of units, that immensity is constituted
of atoms. Because it is only a stone, a pebble,
against which his foot strikes, he makes light
of the hindrance; not caring that he is contracting
a habit of stumbling, or of observing
that whenever he trips there must be some
diminution in the speed with which he runs
the way of God&rsquo;s commandments, and that,
however slowly, these diminutions are certainly
bringing him to a stand.</p>

<p>The astronomer tells us, that, because they
move in a resisting medium, which perhaps
in a million of years destroys the millionth
part of their velocity, the heavenly bodies will
at length cease from their mighty march.
May not, then, the theologian assure us that
little roughnesses in the way, each retarding
us, though in an imperceptible degree, will
eventually destroy the onward movement,
however vigorous and direct it may at one
time have seemed? Would to God that we
could persuade you of the peril of little offences!
We are not half as much afraid of your hurting
the head against a rock, as of your hurting
the foot against a stone. There is a sort of
continued attrition, resulting from our necessary
intercourse with the world, which of itself
deadens the movements of the soul; there is,
moreover, a continued temptation to yield in
little points, under the notion of conciliating;
to indulge in little things, to forego little
strictnesses, to omit little duties; and all with
the idea that what looks so light cannot be of
real moment. And by these littles, thousands,
tens of thousands, perish. If they do not come
actually and openly to a stand, they stumble
and stumble on, getting more and more careless,
nearer and nearer to indifference, lowering
the Christian standards, suffering religion
to be peeled away by inches, persuading themselves
that they can spare without injury such
inconsiderable bits, and not perceiving that
in stripping the bark they stop the sap.&mdash;<i>Melvill.</i></p></div>

up as irreclaimable (Hos. <span class="wsnw">iv. 17).<a id="o12_fna1" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#o12_fn1">[1]</a></span>
<b>III.&nbsp;The folly of expecting sanctification
as the inevitable result of suffering.</b>
Contrary to the expectation of
the Universalists, the sufferings of the
lost may only confirm them in their

While God visits us at all, it is a sign He
thinks of us. The present life is not the time
for punishment devoid of mercy. While the
debtor is on his way to prison, he may agree
with his adversary, and escape the messenger&rsquo;s
hands. While the sick man feels pain, there
is vitality and activity in his constitution, and
he may recover. And therefore I think it
must be a terrible thing to have one&rsquo;s perdition
sealed; to have the process already closed;
both depositions and sentence, and laid up in
God&rsquo;s chancery, as an irreversible doom, and
so him who is its object troubled no further,
but allowed the full choice of his pleasures,&mdash;as
one permits a man, between sentence and
execution, his choice of viands, in full certainty
that when his hour hath tolled the terrible
law will take its course. How smoothly glides
along the boat upon the wide, unruffled, though
most rapid stream that hurries it onward to
<span class="pagenum" id="p17">[p.&nbsp;17]</span>
the precipice, over which its waters break in
thunder! How calm, and undisturbed by the
smallest ripple, slumbers its unreflecting steersman!
Or for one rock in the midst of its
too smooth channel, against which it may be
dashed and whirled about, to shake him from
this infatuated sleep! It is the only hope that
remains for him. Woe to him if to the end
his course be pleasant! That end will pay it
all!&mdash;<i>Wiseman.</i></p></div>

<div class="footnote" id="o12_fn2"><p><a href="#o12_fna2"><span class="label">[2]</span></a>
Afflictions leave the wicked worse, more
impenitent, hardened in sin, and outrageous
in their wicked practices. Every plague on
Egypt added to the plague of hardness on
Pharaoh&rsquo;s heart; he that for some while could
beg prayers of Moses for himself, at last comes
to that pass that he threatens to kill him if
he come to him any more. Or, what a prodigious
height do we see some come to in sin
after some great sickness or other judgment!
Oh, how grossly and ravenous are they after
their prey, when once they got off their clog
and chain from their heels! When physic works
not kindly, it doth not only leave the disease
uncured, but the poison of the physic stays
in the body also. Many appear thus poisoned
by their afflictions.&mdash;<i>Gurnall,</i> 1617&ndash;1679.</p>

<p>Trust not in any unsanctified afflictions, as
if these could permanently and really change
the condition of your heart. I have seen the
characters of the writing which the flames had
turned into a film of buoyant coal; I have seen
the thread which has been passed through the
fire retain, in its cold grey ashes, the twist it
had got in spinning; I have found every
shivered splinter of the flint as hard as the
unbroken stone: and let trials come, in Providence,
sharp as the fire and ponderous as the
crushing hammer, unless a gracious God send
along with these something else than these,
bruised, broken, bleeding as thy heart may be,
its nature remains the same.&mdash;<i>Guthrie.</i></p></div>

<h3 class="tdc" id="o13"><span class="smcap">Needless Stripes.</span></h3>

<p class="bq">i.&nbsp;9. <i>Why should ye be stricken any more? ye will revolt more and more.</i></p>

<p>That sin should not go unpunished
is a law of our own hearts, and it is a
law of God. Punishment is intended
to be <span class="wsnw">remedial;<a id="o13_fna1" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#o13_fn1">[1]</a></span> but remedies that
are intended to cure sometimes irritate,
and God&rsquo;s remedies may act in two
ways&mdash;they may make a man better,
or they may make him <span class="wsnw">worse.<a id="o13_fna2" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#o13_fn2">[2]</a></span>
There are those who &ldquo;kick against
the pricks,&rdquo; and as the result of afflictions
which their own sins have brought
upon them, become desperate. Chastisement
is then of no further use, and
like a father weary of correcting
the child who has proved irreformable, God
may say, &ldquo;Why should,&rdquo; &amp;c. (Hos. iv.&nbsp;17).
Terrible meaning, then, may lurk
in these words: they may speak of
that state in the sinner&rsquo;s career when
his moral malady has become incurable,
when the Good Physician feels that
His severest and most searching remedies
are of no avail, when God withholds
His hand, and says, &ldquo;He that
is filthy, let him be filthy
<span class="wsnw">still.&rdquo;<a id="o13_fna3" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#o13_fn3">[3]</a></span>
So some here understood these words.</p>

<p>But a more gracious meaning may
be contained in them; they may be
the first note of that tender Divine invitation
which is fully expressed in
ver. 18. For mark, God begins here
to reason with men,&mdash;bids them look
at themselves, their situation, the fatal
folly of sinning when sin brings its
own sure punishment. What need of
these disasters? Note: the first aim
of the Gospel is to make the sinner
understand that sin and its torments
are alike of his own seeking; repentance
cannot come until he feels this.</p>

<p>These words may then be regarded
as implying&mdash;<b>I.&nbsp;That there is no inherent
necessity that sinners should
continue to be stricken.</b> 1.&nbsp;There is
no reason <i>in the nature of God</i> (Ezek.
xviii.&nbsp;23). God is love. Love may ordain
laws for the general security and
safety, the breaking of which may be
attended with terrible consequences;
but yet God has no delight when these
consequences overwhelm the transgressor.
He pities even while He punishes,
and is on the outlook for the very first
beginnings of penitence, that He may
stay His <span class="wsnw">hand.<a id="o13_fna4" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#o13_fn4">[4]</a></span>
2.&nbsp;There is no reason
<i>in the nature of man.</i> As man is
not impelled by any inherent necessity
to sin, but in every sin acts by deliberate
choice, so neither is he compelled
to repeat his transgressions. Even
when he has done wrong, his consciousness
testifies that he might have done
right, and it is precisely on this account
that his conscience condemns him!
<span class="pagenum" id="p18">[p.&nbsp;18]</span>
<b>II.&nbsp;That a way of avoiding the merited
punishment is open.</b> We know
what that way is. The prophet saw it
afar off, and rejoiced (ver. 18; ch. liii.&nbsp;5, 6).
&ldquo;Why should ye be stricken
any more,&rdquo; when Christ has been
stricken for you? The way of reconciliation
is open: avail yourselves of it
with patience, with thankful joy!&mdash;But
if men despise the offered grace,
let them know that when the doom
from which they <i>would not</i> be delivered
comes crashing down upon them, they
will neither have nor merit any pity.
Even the Angel of Mercy will answer
them, &ldquo;Ye have destroyed yourselves!&rdquo;&mdash;<i>W. Baxendale.</i></p>

When Almighty God, for the merits of
His Son, not of any ireful mind, but of a
loving heart towards us, doth correct and
punish us, He may be likened unto a father;
as the natural father first teacheth his dear
beloved child, and afterwards giveth him warning,
and then correcteth him at last, even so
the Eternal God assayeth all manner of ways
with us. First He teacheth us His will
through the preaching of His Word, and giveth
us warning. Now if so be that we will not
follow Him, then He beateth us a little with
a rod, with poverty, sickness, or with other
afflictions, which should be esteemed as nothing
else but children&rsquo;s rods, or the wands
of correction. If such a rod will not do any
good, and his son waxeth stubborn, then taketh
the father a whip or a stick, and beateth him
till his bones crack; even so, when we wax
obstinate, and care neither for words nor
stripes, then sendeth God unto us more heavy
and universal plagues. All this He doth to
drive us unto repentance and amendment of
our lives. Now truth it is, that it is against
the father&rsquo;s will to strike his child; he would
much rather do him all the good that ever he
could. Even so certainly, when God sendeth
affliction upon our necks, there lieth hidden
under that rod a fatherly affection. For the
peculiar and natural property of God is to be
loving and friendly, to heal, to help, and to
do good to His children, mankind.&mdash;<i>Wermullerus,</i> 1551.</p>

<p>The surgeon must cut away the rotten and the
dead flesh, that the whole body be not
poisoned, and so perish; even so doth God
sometimes plague our bodies grievously, that
our souls may be preserved and healed. How
deep soever God thrusteth His iron into our
flesh, He doeth it only to heal us; and if it
be so that He kill us, then will He bring us to
the right life. The physician employeth one
poison to drive out another; even so God in
correcting us useth the devil and wicked
people, but yet all to do us good.&mdash;<i>Wermullerus,</i> 1551.</p></div>

Sorrow is in itself a thing neither good
nor bad; its value depends on the spirit
of the person on whom it falls. Fire will inflame
straw, soften iron, or harden clay; its effects
are determined by the object with which it
comes in contact. Warmth develops the energies
of life, or helps the progress of decay.
It is a great power in the hothouse, a great
power also in the coffin; it expands the leaf,
matures the fruit, adds precocious vigour to
vegetable life; and warmth, too, develops with
tenfold rapidity the weltering process of dissolution.
So, too, with sorrow. There are
spirits in which it develops the seminal principle
of life; there are others in which it prematurely
hastens the consummation of irreparable
decay.&mdash;<i>F.&nbsp;W. Robertson.</i></p></div>

As long as the physician hath any hope
of the recovery of his patient, he assayeth
all manner of means and medicine with him,
as well sour and sharp as sweet and pleasant;
but as soon as ever he beginneth to doubt of
his recovery, he suffereth him to have whatever
himself desireth. Even so the heavenly
Physician, as long as He hath any hope to
recover us, will not always suffer us to have
what we most desire; but as soon as He hath
no more hope of us, then He suffereth us for
a time to enjoy all our own pleasure.&mdash;<i>Wermullerus,</i> 1551.</p></div>

It is harder to get sin felt by the creature,

By these powerful figures the prophet

body, so in the body politic the vice
of any one class tends to spread
through all society.&mdash;These two considerations
should lead us&mdash;1.&nbsp;<i>To pray
constantly and earnestly for our country.</i>
&ldquo;Christian England&rdquo; left to itself, and
unrestrained by Divine grace and mercy,
would soon become as Sodom and Gomorrah.
2.&nbsp;<i>Not to be selfishly indifferent
to the sins of the classes of society to
which we do not happen to belong.</i> This
were as foolish as it would be for a
man to give no heed to the fact that
his neighbour&rsquo;s house was on fire, in
forgetfulness or the other fact that fire
spreads; or as if in the body the head

reprobation of them will be of no avail.

will abate and lessen them. No; these
&ldquo;sores&rdquo; are <i>&ldquo;putrefying;&rdquo;</i> and if the
body politic is ever to be restored to
moral health, they must be &ldquo;closed,
bound up, and mollified with ointment.&rdquo;
In some cases this &ldquo;ointment&rdquo;
must be moral suasion, in
other cases legal coercion. This principle
is already recognised in regard to
cockfighting, the sale of indecent books
and pictures, &amp;c. <b>III.&nbsp;In a modified
sense, the declarations of our text are
true of every human being.</b> The doctrine
of &ldquo;total depravity&rdquo; has been
preached in such a manner as to discredit
it, and statements have been
made in exposition of it which would
imply that every child comes into the
world as wicked as Nero left it (not
only depraved in every faculty, but in
every faculty totally depraved!) This
representation of the doctrine is contrary
both to Scripture (2&nbsp;Tim. iii.&nbsp;13;
1&nbsp;Pet. iv.&nbsp;4, &amp;c.) and to fact. But
our rejection of this exaggerated form
of it must not lead us to reject the
doctrine itself. Our whole personality
has been &ldquo;depraved&rdquo;&mdash;debased and
deteriorated&mdash;by sin; the whole man&mdash;his
affections, passions, understanding,
reason, imagination, and will&mdash;has
been impaired by the &ldquo;fall;&rdquo; just
as by certain diseases <i>all</i> the functions
of the body are <span class="wsnw">disordered.<a id="o14_fna1" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#o14_fn1">[1]</a></span>
The natural tendency of this inborn corruption
is not to lessen with increasing
years, but to intensify; as a matter of
fact, <i>aged</i> sinners are always the vilest
and most malignant. These facts&mdash;1.&nbsp;<i>Disclose
man&rsquo;s need of a redemptive power
external to himself.</i> Our moral corruption
is not like one of those minor diseases
which are best left to &ldquo;nature;&rdquo;
it is like a cancer or a malignant fever&mdash;if
it is left to run its course, it will
kill us. There is in us no <span lang="la">vis medicatrix</span>
capable of overcoming and expelling
it. If we are to be restored
to moral soundness, it must be by a
Power external to us. 2.&nbsp;<i>Should lead
us to accept with gratitude the proffered
help of the Great Healer.</i> We all need
His help. Without it we shall grow
worse day by day. His help will avail
for us, however desperate may be our
case; as it was in the days of His
flesh physically, so it is now morally
and spiritually (Matt. iv.&nbsp;23, 24; xiv.&nbsp;36).
<b>IV.&nbsp;Moral depravity brings on
physical misery.</b> The desolation set
forth in vers. 7, 8, was the natural consequence
of the depravity denounced in
vers. 5, 6. By an everlasting and most
righteous decree a bad character and
a bad condition are linked together,
and can be only for a very little while
disassociated. This is true both of
nations and individuals. Sin inevitably
leads to sorrow. Of this fact we
have ten thousand evidences in this
present world. Hence also the realm
of unrelieved wickedness in the realm
of unmitigated woe. Were man always
<span class="pagenum" id="p20">[p.&nbsp;20]</span>
reasonable beings, the fearfulness and
the certainty of the consequences of
sin would be sufficient and prevailing
arguments for repentance and amendment
of life. Let them prevail with
us (Ezek. xviii.&nbsp;30, 21).</p>

It is not only the inferior powers of the
soul which this plague of sin has seized, but
the contagion has ascended into the higher
regions of the soul. The most supreme, most
spiritual faculty in man&rsquo;s mind, the understanding
power of man, is corrupted, and
needs renewing. To a carnal understanding
not enlightened by the Word, this always
has been and is the greatest paradox. Indeed,
when blind reason, which thinks it sees, is
judge, it is not strange that this corruption of
the understanding should be a wonder to it.
The reason, being the supreme faculty of all
the rest, which judges all else, and is judged
by none but itself, because of its nearness to
itself, it least discerns itself. As a man&rsquo;s eye,
though it may see the deformity of another
member, yet not the bloodshot that is in itself,
but it must have a glass by which to discern
it. And so, though even corrupt nature discerns
the rebellions of the affections and sensual
part of man by its own light, as the
heathens did, and complained thereof, yet it
cannot discern the infection and defilement
that is in the spirit itself, but the glass of the
Word is the first that discovers it; and when
that glass is also brought, there had need by
an inward light of grace, which is opposite to
this corruption, to discover it.&mdash;<i>T. Goodwin,</i> 1600&ndash;1679.</p></div>

utterly destroyed them, as He might
have done in strict justice. This reminds
us&mdash;1.&nbsp;That the punishments
that befall wicked men in this world
frequently fall short of their deserts.
2.&nbsp;That this disproportion between
guilt and chastisement occurs because
God is not so much concerned to
punish sin as to reclaim sinners. God

is so reluctant to punish, instead of
encouraging us in rebellion, should
incite us to prompt and loving obedience.

If in an affliction we would pour forth
to God such acceptable prayers as may obtain
comfort in our crosses and deliverance from
all our calamities, we must confess our sins,
and humbly acknowledge that we deserve to
be overwhelmed with much more heavy
plagues and punishments. And so the Lord
will excuse us when we accuse ourselves,
remit our sins when we remember them, and
absolve us from punishment when in all humility
we acknowledge that we have justly deserved
the fearfullest of His plagues. For if
we, who have but a little of the milk of mercy,
are moved with compassion when either our
sons or our servants acknowledge their faults,
and offer themselves of their own accord to
suffer that punishment which they have deserved,

Take heed of abusing this mercy of
God. Suck not poison out of the sweet flower
of God&rsquo;s mercy: do not think that because
God is merciful you may go on in sin; this
is to make mercy your enemy. None might
touch the Ark but the priests, who by their
office were more holy: none may touch the
ark of God&rsquo;s mercy but such as are received to
be holy. He that sins because of mercy
shall have judgment without mercy. Mercy
abused turns to fury (Deut. xxix.&nbsp;19, 20).
&ldquo;The mercy of the Lord is upon them that
fear Him.&rdquo; Mercy is not for them that sin
and fear not, but for them that fear and sin
not. God&rsquo;s mercy is a holy mercy; where it
pardons, it heals.&mdash;<i>Watson,</i> 1696.</p></div>

God, ye people of Gomorrah.</i></p>

<p>The prophet being about to make a
still more terrible announcement, puts
forth a renewed call for attention. It
is well worthy of our study. We find
in it&mdash;</p>

<p>I. <span class="smcap">A Startling Description.</span>
&rdquo;Rulers of Sodom,&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. people of
Gomorrah.&rdquo; What an astonishing declaration
is this, that Sodom, Gomorrah,
and Jerusalem are synonymous
terms! It reminds us&mdash;<b>1.&nbsp;That man
may be morally alike to those from
whom they think themselves the furthest
removed.</b> Many a Protestant
who hates the very name of Rome is
himself a little Pope: he never doubts
his own infallibility, and is ready to
anathematise all who dare to dissent
from him. Many a man who has never
stood in the felon&rsquo;s dock is a thief at
<span class="wsnw">heart.<a id="o16_fna1" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#o16_fn1">[1]</a></span>
The people of Jerusalem
were ready to thank God that they
were not as Sodom and Gomorrah,
whereas they really resembled the
people they despised. For, like the inhabitants
of those guilty cities, they had
been living&mdash;(1)&nbsp;<i>In habitual self-indulgence.</i>
Self-indulgence may vary in its
forms, but in its essential nature it is
ever the same. The inhabitants of
Sodom and Gomorrah had pandered to
the lusts of the body, the inhabitants
of Jerusalem to the lusts of the mind
(see vers. 17, 23; iii.&nbsp;16, &amp;c.)
(2)&nbsp;<i>In habitual defiance of God.</i> The sins of
which they were guilty were as plainly
condemned in God&rsquo;s Word as were those
by which the inhabitants of Sodom and
Gomorrah polluted themselves. All
sin is rebellion against <span class="wsnw">God,<a id="o16_fna2" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#o16_fn2">[2]</a></span>
and the manner in which we sin is comparatively
unimportant (James ii.&nbsp;10).
If we rebel against God, it does not
matter much with what weapons we
fight against Him. <b>2.&nbsp;That men may
be utterly unconscious of their own
real character.</b> Self-delusion as to
character is almost universal. Man can
live in the practice of gross sin without
any compunction of conscience.
Laodicea and the foul criminal David
are at peace until the rebukes of God
begin to crash like thunders over their
heads (Rev. iii.&nbsp;17; 2&nbsp;Sam. xii.&nbsp;7). As
such delusion is most common, so also
it is most disastrous. It renders reform
impossible. It sends men blindfolded
into eternity to the most appalling
<span class="wsnw">surprises.<a id="o16_fna3" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#o16_fn3">[3]</a></span>
The remedy for it is earnest,
searching, prayerful self-examination,
conducted in the light of God&rsquo;s
<span class="wsnw">Word.<a id="o16_fna4" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#o16_fn4">[4]</a></span>
<b>3.&nbsp;That God describes men according
to their essential character.</b> He
does not take men according to their
own estimates of their character and
conduct, and ticked them accordingly.
His description of man is often precisely
the opposite of that which they would
give of themselves, and even of what
men would give of them. His neighbours
as well as himself would doubtless have
described the prosperous farmer (Luke
xii.&nbsp;16) as a shrewd and wise man, but
God pronounced him to be a fool. So
here, these men who prided themselves
that they were rulers of Jerusalem, the
holy city, were declared to be &ldquo;rulers
of Sodom,&rdquo; the vilest of cities. Are
we quite sure that God describes <i>us</i> as
we have been accustomed to describe
ourselves?</p>

<p>II. <span class="smcap">A Solemn Summons.</span> &ldquo;Hear
the <i>word</i> of the Lord;&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. give ear
unto the <i>law</i> of our God.&rdquo; What is
the law to which attention is thus
emphatically called? It is the great
truth announced in the following verses
(11&ndash;15), that <b>worship offered by ungodly
men is not only without value,
but is positively hateful in the sight
of God.</b> The most flaming zeal concerning
the externals of religion is often
found in men of unholy

Judas was evidently so zealous in such matters
as completely to delude his fellow-disciples:
even when Christ announced
that there was a traitor in their midst,
no suspicion turned towards him; the
eleven were more ready to suspect
themselves than him (Matt. xxvi.&nbsp;21).
<span class="pagenum" id="p22">[p.&nbsp;22]</span>
Attention to the externals of religion
is in itself a good thing; but unless it
be conjoined with integrity and benevolence,
it will secure for us at the last
not the commendation but the condemnation
of the Judge (Matt. xxiii.&nbsp;23).</p>

To us there seems a wide difference between
the judge, with the robes of office on his
back, mind in his eye, and dignity in his
mien, and that poor, pale, haggard wretch at
the bar, who throws stealthy glances around,
and hangs his head with shame. Yet the difference
that looks so great to man may be very
small in the eyes of God; and would look
small in ours if we knew the different upbringing
and history of both. The judge never
knew what it was to want a meal; the felon
often went cold and hungry to bed. The one,
sprung of wise, kind, reputable, and perhaps
pious parents, was early trained to good, and
launched, with all the advantages of school and
college, on an honourable and high career;
while the other, bred up a stranger to the
amenities of cultivated and Christian society,
had no such advantages. Born to misery, his
struggles with misfortune and evil began at
the cradle. None ever took him by the hand
to lead him to church or school. A child
of poverty, and the offspring of abandoned
parents, he was taught no lessons but how to
swear, and lie, and drink, and cheat, and steal.
The fact is, it is just as difficult for some to be
honest as it is easy for others. What merit
has that judge in his honesty? None. He
has no temptation to be else than honest. And
so, I suspect, much of the morality of that unblemished
character and decent life in which
many trust, saying to some poor guilty thing,
&ldquo;Stand aside, I am holier than thou,&rdquo; and
pluming themselves on this, that they have not
sinned as others have done&mdash;is due, less to
their superior virtue, than to their more favourable
circumstances. Have they not sinned as
others have done? I reply, They have not
been tempted as others have been. And so
the difference between many honest men and
decent women on the one hand, and those on
the other hand on whom a brand of infamy
has been burned, and the key of a prison turned,
may be just the difference between the green
branch on the tree and the white ashes on the
hearth. This is bathed in the dews of night
and fanned by the breath of heaven, while
that, once as green, has been thrust into the
burning fire&mdash;the one has been tried in a way
that the other has not.&mdash;<i>Guthrie.</i></p></div>

As every sin is a violation of the law, so
every violation of the law reflects upon the lawmaker.
It is the same offence to coin a penny
and a piece; the same to counterfeit the seal
of a subp&oelig;na, as of a pardon. The second
table was writ by the hand of God as well as
the first, and the majesty of God, as He is

a theft as well as in an idolatry or a blasphemy.&mdash;<i>Donne,</i> 1573&ndash;1631.</p></div>

Is there anything more terrible than a
false confidence? It is an awful thing to wake
up and find that what we have been trusting
in is rotten. To embark gaily in a ship that
on mid-ocean proves to be worm-eaten, and
leaky; for a man who believed himself to be
wealthy to receive tidings that the failure
of a bank has made him a beggar; for a sick
man rejoicing in the cessation of his pain to
be told by his physician that that is due only
to the setting in of mortification that precedes
death;&mdash;what horrible disappointments are
these! But what poor and faint image they
furnish of the horror of that man who lives in a
state of delusion as to his spiritual condition,
who dies in peace, imagining falsely that he is
Christ&rsquo;s, and who, when he has traversed the
valley of the shadow of death&mdash;when he has
reached that point from which there is no
return, finds that the doors of heaven are shut
against him, discovers that he is shrouded by
thick darkness, and begins to feel the fires of
hell kindling upon him! Can you picture to
yourself his astonishment, his terror, his despair?
Do not tell me that such a case is not
conceivable&mdash;Christ declares that such cases
are frequent (Matt. vii.&nbsp;21&ndash;25).</p></div>

&ldquo;Examine yourselves:&rdquo; A metaphor
from metal, that is pierced through to see if
it be gold within. Self-examination is a
spiritual inquisition set up in one&rsquo;s soul: a
man must search his heart for sin as one
would search a house for a traitor: or as Israel
sought for leaven to burn it.&mdash;<i>Watson,</i> 1696.</p>

<p>This duty of examining and proving supposes
that there is some sure standard, which
if we go by, we are sure not to be deceived.
Not that rule is the Word of God. But as in
matters of doctrine men have left the Scripture,
the sure rule, and taken up antiquity,
universality, tradition, and the like for their
pride, and by this means have fallen into the
ditch; so in matters of godliness, when we
should try ourselves according to the characters
and signs that the Scripture deciphers,
we take up principles in the world, the applause
of others, the conversation of most in the
world. And thus it is with us as men in an
hospital, because every one is either wounded
or lame, or some way diseases, therefore none
are offensive to each other.&mdash;<i>Burgess.</i></p>

<p>Men compare themselves with men, and
readily with the worst, and flatter themselves
with that comparative betterness. This is not
the way to see spots, to look into the muddy
streams of profane men&rsquo;s lives; but look into
the clear fountain of the Word, and there we
may both discern and wash them; and consider
the infinite holiness of God, and this will
humble us to the dust.&mdash;<i>Leighton,</i> 1611&ndash;1684.</p></div>

Fruit-trees that bring forth the fairest
and most beautiful blossoms, leaves, and
shoots, usually bring forth the fewest and
least fruits; because where nature is intent
and vigorously pressing to do one work, spending
<span class="pagenum" id="p23">[p.&nbsp;23]</span>
its strength there, it is not at the same time
weak about other works; but distinct and
several works of nature, in moderate and
remote degree, are all promoted at the same
time. Generally those persons who are excessive
and most curious about the forms of
duties, have least of the power of godliness.
The Pharisees were extremely careful about
the outside of God&rsquo;s worship. So it was
among us of late years; bowing at the name
of Jesus, the communion-table, surplice, common
prayer, &amp;c.,&mdash;those and suchlike were
pressed with all eagerness and strictness. The
body of religion was large and monstrous, but
without a soul: or, if any, it was lean and
feeble. These persons are like the Indian fig-tree
that Pliny speaks of, which had leaves as
broad as targets, but fruits no bigger than
a bean. This is a foul fault among us at this
day: men stand more about the forms of worship
than about the power of it: they look so
much after the way, manner, and circumstances
that they almost lose the substance;
things which are but as husks or shells to the
kernels, or as leaves in respect of fruits.&mdash;<i>Austen,</i> 1656.</p>

<p>Many are set upon excess of ceremonies,
because they are defective in the vital parts,
and should have no religion if they had not
this. All sober Christians are friends to outward
decency and order; but it is the empty
self-deceiver that is most for the unwarrantable
inventions of man, and useth the worship of
God but as a masque or puppet-show, where
there are great doings with little life, and to
little purpose. The chastest woman will wash
her face; but it is the harlot, or wanton, or
deformed, that will paint it. The soberest
and the comeliest will avoid a nasty or ridiculous
habit, which may make them seem
uncomely where they are not; but a curious
dress and excessive care doth signify a crooked
or deformed body, or a filthy skin, or, which
is worst, an empty soul, that hath need of
such a covering. Consciousness of such greater
want doth cause them to seek these poor supplies.
The gaudiness of men&rsquo;s religion is not
the best sign that it is sincere. Simplicity is
the ordinary attendant of sincerity. It hath
long been a proverb, &ldquo;The more ceremony,
the less substance; and the more compliment,
the more craft.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Baxter,</i> 1615&ndash;1691.</p></div>

<h3 class="tdc" id="o17"><span class="smcap">Rejected Sacrifices.</span></h3>

<p class="bq">i.&nbsp;11. <i>To what purpose is the multitude of your sacrifices unto me? saith the Lord.</i></p>

<p>Try to conceive what emotions would
spring up in the breasts of the men to
whom these words were first addressed&mdash;men
who with most scrupulous care
had fulfilled the requirements of a costly
ceremonial worship, the respectable,
the orthodox of their day. With what
indignation they would rebuke the prophet,
and how triumphantly they would
remind him that all the sacrifices which
they offered, and all the ceremonies
they observed, were of Divine appointment!
And, doubtless, to their
rebuke they would add a protestation
that they had had a sincere delight in
the services, which, they would not
doubt, had come up as a sweet-smelling
savour before the Lord. Both these
allegations they might have made with
truth, but the prophet would have
dismissed them as irrelevant. What
he denounced was not sacrifices, but
certain sacrifices offered by particular
individuals whose wickedness disqualified
them for taking part in Divine
worship. &ldquo;To what purpose is the
multitude of <i>your</i> sacrifices,&rdquo; &amp;c.</p>

<p>But why should the wickedness of
the worshippers cause the rejection of
the worship, seeing that <i>it</i> is of Divine
appointment? Because&mdash;1.&nbsp;<i>Sacrifices are
in themselves worthless to God.</i> He does
not need, nor is He enriched by our
offerings (Ps. l.&nbsp;7&ndash;13). 2.&nbsp;<i>Sacrifices
were instituted merely to be expressions of
and helps to human piety, and are worthless
when there is no piety to be expressed
or fostered by them.</i> Outward worship
is to religion just what a bank-note is
to commerce; it is valuable only in so
far as it is really representative of something
beyond itself. The worship which
does not really represent penitence,
faith, and love in the worshipper is a
falsehood, and is necessarily repulsive
to the God of truth, and to the offerer
of it it is a deadly hurt. As the sunlight
which develops life only hastens
the putrefaction of the dead, so the
very services which help to sanctify
and ennoble the saintly may more
completely disqualify the insincere for
heaven. 3.&nbsp;<i>Piety towards God is proved,
not by costly sacrifices and stately ceremonies,
even though pungent emotions are
experienced by those who offer and take
part in them, but by its pervasive influence
on the character and the life.</i> In family
<span class="pagenum" id="p24">[p.&nbsp;24]</span>
life love is proved by obedience; and
to our Heavenly Father the protestations
of reverence and love which are
offered by men who live in disregard
and defiance of His requirements are
naturally and necessarily repulsive (1&nbsp;Sam. xv.&nbsp;22, 23).
No elaborateness
or costliness of ceremonial worship can
atone for the absence of godliness in
the lives of the worshippers; sacrifices
are no equivalents for sanctification;
and by the love of sin in the soul of the
pretended worshipper even a divinely-appointed
ritual is rendered abhorrent
to God.</p>

<p>Judaism and its ritual are now things
of the past, but men still need to be
reminded of the facts now pointed out.
The men of our day, after committing
during the week all the sins denounced
in the prophecies of Isaiah, assemble in
the sanctuary on Sunday, and,
because they enjoy its services, they
imagine that they are well-pleasing to
God, and will bring down His blessing
on themselves. To-day, as of old, men
need to be told plainly that public
worship may be an abomination to God,
and that, instead of making those who
join in it more sure of heaven, it may,
by confirming them in their self-delusion,
make their eternal damnation
more certain.</p>

<p>There is another side to all this.
While &ldquo;the sacrifice of the wicked is
an abomination to the Lord,&rdquo; <i>&ldquo;the
prayer of the upright is His delight&rdquo;</i> (Psa.
cxlvii.&nbsp;11; l.&nbsp;23). Concerning the
&ldquo;true worshippers,&rdquo; who &ldquo;worship the
Father in spirit and in truth,&rdquo; it is declared
that &ldquo;the Father <i>seeketh</i> such to
worship Him.&rdquo; How wonderful, how
astonishing is that! That <span class="smcap">God,</span> whom
angels, archangels, and all the shining
hosts of heaven adore, should not
merely condescend to accept the worship
of men upon earth, but that He
should <i>seek</i> such worship! Think much
of that surprising and comforting assurance.
It used to seem to me almost too
wonderful to be true, but I believe
and understand it now. I am helped
to understand it almost every day; for
almost every day my little girl steals
away from her nursemaid. I hear her
climbing laboriously up the stairs; it
is an immense journey for her little
legs; and then presently she knocks at
my door, and calls me by my name. I
am often busy when she comes; she
interrupts me when it is not pleasant
to be interrupted; but, notwithstanding,
I rejoice that there is so much love
for me in her heart that she thinks it
worth while to climb up so far, just
to see me for a moment and then be
sent down again. So the marvellous
<i>&ldquo;seeketh&rdquo;</i> is explained by the word
that comes before it! The &ldquo;<span class="smcap">Father</span>
seeketh such to worship Him&rdquo;! When
His children come, and knock at His
door, and call &ldquo;Abba, Father!&rdquo; He
listens with a joy that only a father can
understand.</p>

<p class="bqpoemr">&ldquo;His saints are precious in His sight;<br />
&nbsp;He views His children with delight;<br />
&nbsp;He sees their hope, He knows their fear,<br />
&nbsp;And looks, and loves His image there.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="bq">i. 11, 16, 17. <i>To what purpose is the multitude of your sacrifices unto me? saith
the Lord. I am full of the burnt-offerings of rams, and the fat of fed beasts; and I
delight not in the blood of bullocks, or of lambs, or of he-goats.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Wash you, make
you clean; put away the evil of your doings from before mine eyes; cease to do evil;

<p>What was the business of the ancient
prophet? Not merely to predict events.
His chief work was to make men realise
vividly the presence of God. Religions,
in order to their permanence, require
system. But religious systems, with
their creeds, forms, and ceremonies,
have an inevitable tendency to coldness
and deadness. The prophet was sent
to counteract this tendency. It was
his mission to restore to great words
their great meanings, to cause moral
<span class="pagenum" id="p25">[p.&nbsp;25]</span>
principles to reassert themselves as the
lords of conscience and of will&mdash;in a
word, to prophesy on the dry bones of
a decaying religion until there came
upon them flesh and sinew, and there
passed into them the breath of spiritual
life. Such a mission was that of Isaiah.
In his time religion was in a state of
petrifaction, nay, rather of putrefaction.
From this fact his prophetic
message takes its keynote. It begins
with an invective that reminds us of
John the Baptist.</p>

<p>What was the condition of things
that provoked his indignation? Not a
lack of religious observances; there
was a redundancy of them. That
which caused a righteous anger to burn
with him vehemently was their perversion
of the sacrificial system to
which they gloried, their dissociation
of it from the moral law, to which
God intended it to be only a supplement.
It was given to teach men the
hatefulness of sin, and the duty of consecration
to God; but they separated
it from the moral law, and allowed all
its spiritual meaning to drop out of it.
Instead of using it as a help to morality,
they were making it the substitute for
morality. Coming up red-handed from
their murders, and reeking with their
foul vices, they stood up before God,
claiming His favour; for were they not
sacrificing to Him, yea, in accordance
with the regulations Himself had given?
No wonder that a man with veracity in
him and a love of righteousness should
pour out upon such men and such offerings
the whole wrath of his nature.</p>

<p>From this exposition take the
following practical lessons&mdash;1.&nbsp;<i>All
forms of religion have a tendency to lose
their original purity and freshness.</i> As
a stream, clear at its fountain-head,
but turbid before it reaches the sea;
as our planet, which physicists say
was flung off at first from the sun a
glowing mass of light and heat, has
been cooling down ever since; so is it
with religions and churches. As a
rule, their history has been one of
gathering accretions and of diminishing
purity and power in proportion to
their distance from their fountain-head.
So was it with Judaism. So has it been
with Christianity. Contrast Christianity
as we have it in St. Paul&rsquo;s epistles,
all aglow with fervour and love, and
that of the time of Leo X., with its
professed head and most of his court
professed infidels, and the officials of
the Church selling indulgences to sin
for money! Luther lit the fire again;
but Protestantism has had its illustrations
of the same law. Witness the
state of things in this country in the
last century. In view of this fact let the
Church pray for prophetic spirits who
shall in each generation rekindle the
dying fires; and, apart from the influence
of specially-gifted men, let each
Church betake itself continually to the
Fountain-head of spiritual life.
2.&nbsp;<i>False religiousness is worse than none at
all.</i> Isaiah says, not simply that such
observances are of no avail with God,
but that they are abominations to
Him. We can see the reason. Such
a religion as that which Isaiah denounced
works harm to the individual
and to the cause of godliness generally;
to the individual, but inspiring him
with a vain confidence; to the cause
of godliness, by furnishing points for
the shafts of ridicule, by which faith is
killed in many hearts. It would be
difficult to say who are the greatest promoters
of infidelity&mdash;professed atheists
or hypocritical religionists. 3.&nbsp;<i>It is a
perilous thing to overlook the connection
between impression and practice in religion.</i>
In vers. 16 and 17, the prophet shows us
what the true nexus between them is.
&ldquo;Your ceremonies and observances will
do you no good unless you practise the
morality, the judgment, mercy, and
love to which they point.&rdquo; Our power
of receiving impressions is under a
directly opposite law from our power
of practice. The former steadily decreases
by exercise, the latter as
steadily increases. This is so in
religion, as well as in other things.
The impression produced upon the
Jews by the sacrifices would decrease
as they were repeated, unless by them
they were led to practical righteousness,
and their whole system would
<span class="pagenum" id="p26">[p.&nbsp;26]</span>
in time become utterly powerless as
a moral incentive; just as, if a man is
for a few mornings wilfully deaf to an
alarum in his bedroom, it presently
loses its power even to waken him.
The same law will operate with us.
The preaching of the gospel is intended
to produce impression, and that again
to lead to practice. If the latter does
not follow <i>at once,</i> the chances are all
against its ever following, because the
impressions will become feebler with
each repetition. A fact this for all
hearers to ponder. 4.&nbsp;<i>Religious observances
and machinery of all kinds have
their end in the development of character.</i>
This was so in Isaiah&rsquo;s time. It is
so now. If their religious observances
were not leading them to &ldquo;cease to be
evil,&rdquo; and to &ldquo;learn to do well,&rdquo; but
were hindering them from doing so, it
were better for them to give them up.
So our creeds, organisations, ministers,
&amp;c., are of use only as related to
character. They are the scaffolding,
character is the building; they are the
tools, that the work. If no building
is going on, this parade of scaffolding
is an imposture, and had better be
swept away.&mdash;<i>J. Brierley, B.A.</i></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 class="tdc" id="o19"><span class="smcap">The Possibilities of Public Worship.</span></h3>

<p class="bq">i.&nbsp;13. <i>It is iniquity, even this solemn meeting.</i></p>

<p><b>I. Public worship is a thing of Divine
appointment.</b> A considerable part
of the earlier books of Scripture is
occupied with injunctions to observe
it, and with directions for its conduct.
All the best men of ancient times made
public worship part of the business of
their lives. David, Josiah, Hezekiah,
Ezra, and Nehemiah made great sacrifices
that it might be duly honoured.
Our Lord Himself, who set aside the
traditions of men, was careful to observe
this Divine ordinance; besides attending
the great feasts, He attended the
synagogue every Sabbath-day (Luke iv.&nbsp;16).
The apostles and early Christians
were in this respect His true followers
(Acts ii.&nbsp;46; iii.&nbsp;1). And we are expressly
warned against neglect of it
(Heb. x.&nbsp;24, 25). <b>II.&nbsp;Public worship
may be a means of communion with
God.</b> It was this possibility that
induced men to build the Temple,
that there might be a recognised place
of meeting, not only with each other,
but with God. There God did often
meet with them (Ps. lxiii.&nbsp;2, xxvii.&nbsp;4,
&amp;c.) The temple now is wherever
devout men are assembled for worship,
and God, in the person of His Son, has
expressly promised to be in their midst
(Matt. xviii.&nbsp;20). <b>III.&nbsp;Consequently
public worship may be a thing of the
highest profit to man.</b> Upon those to
whom communion with God is indeed
vouchsafed, public worship exerts a
transforming and ennobling
<span class="wsnw">influence.<a id="o19_fna1" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#o19_fn1">[1]</a></span>
They are uplifted for a season
above the cares, the sorrows, and the
joys of life; they receive new strength
for the performance of life&rsquo;s duties and
the bearing of life&rsquo;s burdens; from the
mount of supplication they come down
bearing a more real and abiding likeness
to God than that which in the old
time gave to the countenance of Moses
an overwhelming splendour. <b>IV.&nbsp;It
may also be a thing supremely acceptable
to God.</b> When His children
assemble to unite in expressing
their common thankfulness, trust,
and love for Him, He listens with
fatherly <span class="wsnw">delight.<a id="o19_fna2" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#o19_fn2">[2]</a></span>
Compared with angelic worship, human worship is a
very poor and imperfect thing; it is
but an earthen vessel compared with a
chalice of silver or of gold; but the
emotions of gratitude, trust, and love
with which it is filled, make it precious
in His sight. There is a reversal of
our Lord&rsquo;s saying (Matt. xxiii.&nbsp;19):
the rude altar is hallowed by the spiritual
sacrifice.</p>

<p>These are some of the possibilities of
public worship; but they are not the
only ones. The reverse of all this may
be true. The worship may be observed
and offered without any real regard to
the Divine will and pleasure; it may
separate God and men still more
<span class="pagenum" id="p27">[p.&nbsp;27]</span>
widely; it may be a curse to those
who partake in it, and it may be a
grievous offence to the Holy One of
Israel.</p>

<p>Let us recall some of the things in
connection with public worship which
are apt to satisfy men. They are such
as these: a crowded assembly; sweet
singing; a noble liturgy; an eloquent
sermon; a large collection. When
these things are combined in any service,
we are apt to felicitate ourselves
exceedingly. But upon that very service
God may look with unqualified
condemnation. The crowd may have
assembled for reasons very far removed
from a desire to worship God; the
singing may have been merely an
artistic performance; the liturgy may
have been made up of prayers such as
that which a newspaper described as
&ldquo;the most eloquent ever <i>addressed to a
Boston audience;</i>&rdquo; the sermon may have
had for its supreme object the glorification
of the preacher; the contributors
to the collection may have been moved
merely by a desire to place the name
of their congregation at the head of the
subscription-list published in the newspapers
on the following day. The
whole thing may have been of the
earth, earthy, and this may have been
God&rsquo;s verdict concerning it, &ldquo;It is
iniquity, even the solemn meeting.&rdquo;</p>

<p>What, then, are the elements in
worship essential to its acceptance
with God? 1.&nbsp;<i>That it be offered by His
people.</i> Not from rebels against His
authority will He accept expressions
of <span class="wsnw">homage;<a id="o19_fna3" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#o19_fn3">[3]</a></span>
in their lips such expressions
are mockeries vile and horrible
as those wherewith in Pilate&rsquo;s judgment-hall
the Roman soldiers jeered at the
Son of God (Matt. xxvii.&nbsp;27&ndash;29).
2.&nbsp;<i>That it be offered with reverence,</i> with
that sweet and solemn awe which is
born of a recognition of God&rsquo;s nearness
and of His exceeding glory (Ps.
<span class="wsnw">lxxxix. 7).<a id="o19_fna4" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#o19_fn4">[4]</a></span>
3.&nbsp;<i>That it be the expression of love</i>&mdash;love
singing in the hymns, breathing
in the prayers, awakening &ldquo;godly
sorrow&rdquo; for the sins of the past, leading
to sincere and resolute dedication
of the whole being to God for the future.
Where these principles animate the
worshippers, they will be governed by
them also in daily life; their whole
life will be a service and sacrifice well-pleasing
in the sight of God, and what
are called their &ldquo;acts of worship&rdquo; will
not be artificial flowers stuck on to
dead and rotting branches for their
adornment, but sweet, natural blossoms,
upon which God will smile, and which
He will pronounce &rdquo;very good.&rdquo;</p>

The mind is essentially the same in the
peasant and the prince; the forces of it naturally
equal in the untaught man and in the
philosopher; only the one of these is busied
in meaner affairs and within narrower bounds,
the other exercises himself in things of weight
and moment; and this is that put the wide
distance between them. Noble objects are to
the mind what the sunbeams are to a bud or
flower: they open and unfold, as it were, the
leaves of it, put it upon exerting and spreading
itself every way, and call forth all those
powers that lie hid and locked up in it. The
praise and admiration of God, therefore,
brings this advantage along with it, that it
sets our faculties upon their full stretch, and
improves them to all the degrees of perfection
of which they are capable.&mdash;<i>Atterbury,</i> 1663&ndash;1732.</p></div>

<div class="footnote" id="o19_fn2"><p><a href="#o19_fna2"><span class="label">[2]</span></a>
No doubt the prayers which the faithful
put up to heaven from under their private
roofs, were very acceptable unto Him; but if
a saint&rsquo;s single voice in prayer be so sweet to
God&rsquo;s ear, much more the Church choir, His
saints&rsquo; prayers in consort together. A father
is glad to see any one of his children, and
makes him welcome when he visits him, but
much more when they come together, the
greatest feast is when they all meet as his
house. The public praises of the Church are
the emblem of heaven itself, when all the
angels and saints make but one consort.
There is a wonderful prevalency in the joint
prayers of His people. When Peter was in
prison, the Church meets and prays him out
of his enemies&rsquo; hands. A prince will grant a
petition subscribed by the hands of a whole
city, which maybe he would not at the request
of a private subject, and yet love him
well too. There is an especial promise to
public prayer: <i>&ldquo;Where two or three are gathered
together in My Name, there am I in the
midst of them.&rdquo;</i>&mdash;<i>Gurnall,</i> 1617&ndash;1679.</p></div>

If a person was to attend the levee of an
earthly prince every court-day, and pay his
obeisance punctually and respectfully, but at
other times speak and act in opposition to his
sovereign, the king would justly deem such a
one an hypocrite and an enemy. Nor will a
solemn and stated attendance on the means of
grace in the house of God prove us to be God&rsquo;s
children and friends,&mdash;if we confine our religion
to the church walls, and do not devote
<span class="pagenum" id="p28">[p.&nbsp;28]</span>
our lips and lives to the glory of that Saviour
we profess to love.&mdash;<i>Salter.</i></p></div>

<div class="footnote" id="o19_fn4"><p><a href="#o19_fna4"><span class="label">[4]</span></a>
A remembrance of God&rsquo;s omnipresence
will quell distractions in worship. The actual
thoughts of this would establish our thoughts,
pull them back when they begin to rove, and
blow off all the froth that lies on the top of our
spirits. An eye taken up with the presence of
one object is not at leisure to be filled with
another; he that looks intently upon the sun
shall have nothing for a while but the sun in
his eye. Oppose to every intruding thought
the idea of the Divine omnipresence, and put
it to silence by the awe of His majesty. When
the master is present, scholars mind their
books, keep their place, and run not over the
forms to play with one another; and the
master&rsquo;s eye keeps an idle servant to his work,
that otherwise would be gazing at every straw,
and prating to every passenger. How soon
would the remembrance of this dash all
extravagant fancies out of countenance, just
as the news of the approach of a prince would
huddle up their vain sports, and prepare
themselves for a reverent behaviour in his
sight. We should not dare to give God a
piece of our heart, when we apprehend Him
present with the whole; we should not dare
to mock one that we knew were more inwards
with us than we are with ourselves, and that
beheld every motion of our mind as well as
action of our body.&mdash;<i>Charnock,</i> 1628&ndash;1680.</p>

<p>I have sometimes had the misfortune to sit
in concerts where persons would chatter and
giggle and laugh during the performances of
the profoundest passages of the symphonies of
the great artists; and I never fail to think, at
such times, &ldquo;I ask to know neither you, nor
your father and mother, nor your name: I
know what you <i>are,</i> by the way you conduct
yourself here&mdash;by the want of sympathy and
appreciation which you evince respecting what
is passing around you.&rdquo; We could hardly help
striking a man who should stand looking upon
Niagara Falls without exhibiting emotions of
awe and admiration. If we were to see a man
walk through galleries of genius, totally unimpressed
by what he saw, we should say to
ourselves, &ldquo;Let us be rid of such an unsusceptible
creature as that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Now I ask you to pass upon yourselves the
same judgment. What do you suppose angels
that have trembled and quivered with ecstatic
joy in the presence of God, think when they
see how indifferent you are to the Divine love
and goodness in which you are perpetually
bathed, and by which you are blessed and sustained
every moment of your lives? How can
they do otherwise than accuse you of monstrous
ingratitude and moral insensibility, which betoken
guilt as well as danger?&mdash;<i>Beecher.</i></p></div>

<p class="bq">i.&nbsp;14. <i>Your new moons and your appointed feasts my soul hateth: they are a
trouble unto me; I am weary to bear them.</i></p>

<p>It is the Almighty who here speaks,
and His speech is a protest to men
who imagined that by their worship
they would conciliate and please Him.
Their worship He rejects: it was polluted
by the pollution of those who
offered it. Instead of cleansing them,
as they vainly dreamed, they had defiled
it. It is the Almighty who
speaks, and in what terms of intensity
of pain! He speaks as one who has
long been burdened by a load that has
at length become intolerable. Strictly
speaking, it is of worship offered to
Him by ungodly men that He here
expressed His abhorrence; but it is
not conceivable&mdash;it is contrary to repeated
declarations of His Word to
suppose&mdash;that this is the only form of
human transgression that is grievous
to Him; and therefore we may fairly
widen our contemplation, and consider&mdash;</p>

<p><b>I. God&rsquo;s sensibility to human sin.</b>
God is unchangeable; with Him there
is no fickleness or caprice (James i.&nbsp;17);
this is one of the glories of His
nature. But how strangely have philosophers
and theologians interpreted
this sublime declaration! They have
presented us with a deity impassive as
the stars, which shine with equal
splendour upon the display of great
virtues and the perpetration of hideous
crimes, calm, serene, undisturbed by
anything that takes place on earth.
Not such is the God of the Bible. He
thrills with intensest emotions of delight
or of disapprobation, of joy or of
sorrow (Jer. ix.&nbsp;24; Nahum i.&nbsp;6;
Zeph. iii.&nbsp;17; Gen. iii.&nbsp;6). Let philosophers
call these &ldquo;anthropomorphic
representations&rdquo; if they will, but words
have no meaning if such declarations
do not teach that God is stirred by
emotions which are determined by the
<span class="pagenum" id="p29">[p.&nbsp;29]</span>
character and conduct of men. He is
no cast-iron deity: He is &ldquo;the living
God.&rdquo; Sin is hateful to Him, because
1.&nbsp;<i>It is an infraction of that order which
He has established for the moral well-being
of the universe.</i> As the Sovereign of the
universe, He is bound to resent and to
punish any injury done to the meanest
of His <span class="wsnw">subjects.<a id="o20_fna1" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#o20_fn1">[1]</a></span>
2.&nbsp;<i>It is a defiance
of His authority.</i> Every sinner is a
rebel against the authority of the King
of kings; and that king would be unworthy
of his crown who could see his
authority defied without feeling any
emotion of displeasure, or without
taking steps to vindicate his authority.
It was precisely this selfish and pusillanimous
weakness that made our
Stephen despised and hated by his
subjects. With God there is longsuffering
and tender mercy, but there
is no weakness. Sin is more than a
defiance of God&rsquo;s authority; it is&mdash;3.&nbsp;<i>An
offence against His feelings.</i> It is
contrary to what we may call His
<span class="wsnw">instincts.<a id="o20_fna2" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#o20_fn2">[2]</a></span>
That which is contrary to
our best instincts fills us with disgust
and anger. What profound emotion
is stirred in a man of generosity and
benevolence by a story of oppression
and wrong! <i>e.g.,</i> the effect upon David
of Nathan&rsquo;s parable (2&nbsp;Sam. xii.&nbsp;5).
Whole communities have been roused
to uncontrollable indignation by a
crime of unusual atrocity, even though
no member of the community has been
directly affected thereby. &ldquo;Lynch
Law.&rdquo; So all sin, as sin, arouses the
Divine disgust and indignation. &ldquo;My
<i>soul</i> hateth.&rdquo; 4.&nbsp;<i>It is a degradation of
those whom God loves.</i> We all condemn
and loathe drunkenness; but who of
us loathes it as does that mother who
is being hurried by it to an untimely
and dishonoured grave? God loves us
more than any mother ever loved her
son, and His hatred of sin is proportioned
by His love for us whom it
degrades and <span class="wsnw">destroys.<a id="o20_fna3" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#o20_fn3">[3]</a></span>
5.&nbsp;<i>It is
often a wrong inflicted on those whom He
loves.</i> Few men sin without wronging
others as well as themselves. Now
with what anger do we burn when we
detect our children defrauding and
oppressing each other! But between
the sputtering of a lucifer-match and
the glowing fires of a volcano, there is
not so much disparity as between the
anger which the spectacle of sins
against brotherhood kindles in us
and that which it rouses in God (Jer.
ix.&nbsp;9). To form any adequate conception
of the offensiveness of sin to
God, we must remember that these
considerations do not operate singly,
but operate in combination to make
it hateful to Him. How marvellous,
then, is His endurance of it! Consider,
then&mdash;</p>

<p><b>II. God&rsquo;s patience with human sin.</b>
He speaks here of being &ldquo;troubled&rdquo;
by the worship of ungodly men; it is
a burden of which He is &ldquo;weary.&rdquo;
Why, then, does He bear it for a
moment? Why, then, does He not
give quick vent to the indignation that
burns within Him, and consume His
troubles with swift destruction? He
bears with us&mdash;1.&nbsp;<i>That by His patience
He may appeal to our better feelings.</i>
He does us good, and not evil (Matt.
v.&nbsp;45), that we may be made ashamed
to sin against such generosity. When
men are not altogether hardened in
iniquity, there is nothing so likely to
overcome them as a requital of wrongs
by <span class="wsnw">blessing,<a id="o20_fna4" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#o20_fn4">[4]</a></span>
especially where he
who so requites it has full power to
avenge himself. By His long-suffering,
God has led countless thousands to
repentance. 2.&nbsp;<i>That He may set us an
example of self-restraint.</i> It is because
He is Himself so slow to anger, that
He is able to warn us against vindictiveness.
God does not only lay upon
us precepts of excellence: He Himself
embodies them. 3.&nbsp;<i>That He may place
the righteousness of his judgments beyond
dispute.</i> A space of grace and forbearance
seems necessary to enable onlookers
to perceive that the awful
doom which at length will come upon
sinners is fully deserved, and is perfectly
consistent with His own mercifulness.
If &ldquo;Wisdom&rdquo; had not &ldquo;called,&rdquo;
reproved, counselled, &ldquo;stretched out
her hands&rdquo; in entreaty, the stern words
in which she announces the awful
and irrevocable doom of her despisers
would shock us (Prov. i.&nbsp;20, 32). 4.&nbsp;<i>That</i>
<span class="pagenum" id="p30">[p.&nbsp;30]</span>
<i>a moral probation may be rendered
possible.</i> If punishment always instantly
and obviously followed transgression,
the world would be ruled by
terror so overwhelming that free agency
would be destroyed, and virtue consequently
rendered impossible. For
such reasons as these, God bears with
sinners, and &ldquo;sentence against an evil
work&rdquo; is not executed speedily.</p>

<p><b>III. God&rsquo;s protest against human
sin.</b> God suffers under human sin,
but He does not suffer in silence:
He vehemently protests against it.
Two reasons should lead us to heed
this protest:&mdash;1.&nbsp;<i>Gratitude.</i> He might
have sent vengeance without warning.
His protests and threatenings are
proofs of His love. All that is noblest
and best in us should lead us to give
instant and thankful heed when God
appeals to us, and says, &ldquo;Oh, do not
this abominable thing that I hate!&rdquo;
(Jer. xliv.&nbsp;4). But if sin has so debased
your nature that higher considerations
such as this cannot move you,
then I appeal&mdash;2.&nbsp;to your <i>instinct of
self-preservation.</i> God&rsquo;s protest against
sin is no unmeaning form: His threatenings
against sin are no empty words
(Prov. xxix.&nbsp;1). Rightly considered,
the sinner&rsquo;s untroubled condition is the
most awful of all <span class="wsnw">warnings.<a id="o20_fna5" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#o20_fn5">[5]</a></span></p>

The tempter persuadeth the sinner that
it cannot be that God should make so great a
matter of sin, because the thoughts of a man&rsquo;s
heart, or his words, or deeds, are matter of no
great moment, when man himself is so poor a
worm, and whatever he doth is no hurt to
God. But if God so much regard us as to
make us, and preserve us continually, and to
become our Governor, and make a law for us
and judge us, and reward His servants with
no less than heaven; then you may easily see
that He so much regardeth us, as to observe
whether we obey or break His laws. He that
so far careth for a clock or watch, as to make
it and wind it up, doth care whether it go true
or false. What do these men make of God,
who think He cares now what men do! Then
He cares not if man beat you, or rob you, or
kill you, for none of this hurteth God. And
the king may say, &ldquo;If any murder your
friends and children, why should I punish
him? he hurt not me.&rdquo; But justice is to keep
order in the world, and not only to preserve
the governor from hurt: God may not be wronged,
though He be not hurt. And He will make
you pay for it, if you hurt others; and smart
for it, if you hurt yourself.&mdash;<i>Baxter,</i> 1618&ndash;1691.</p></div>

<div class="footnote" id="o20_fn2"><p><a href="#o20_fna2"><span class="label">[2]</span></a>
Our sin is not so much a violation of a
law that lies outside of the bosom of God, as
it is a disregard of the feelings and nature of
God Himself. You will by a moment&rsquo;s reflection
see that there is a marked distinction
between personal feeling infringed upon and
law transgressed. The magistrate sits upon
the bench, and a culprit is brought before
him. There are two ways in which that culprit
may be considered as transgressing. He
may have broken the law of the land, which
the magistrate represents officially, but not
personally. The magistrate regards him as a
culprit, to be sure. But suppose that, in the
exercise of truth and justice by a pure administration
or decision, the magistrate arouses
the anger of the culprit, and he insults him
to his face, and in his own court; is there any
difference between his former crime, which
was the violation of the law of the land, and
in his latter crime, which is a transgression
of the feeling of the magistrate, sitting as a
magistrate?</p>

<p>It is the same everywhere. When you
employ men in your affairs, you know that
there is a distinction between a disregard of
the rules of business, and a personal disagreement
with yourself. You know that when a
man offends against you, his wrong is more
heinous and provoking than when he offends
against your rules or laws. We know that a
child may violate the laws of morality as they
are established by the Word of God and by
the consent of the community; that he may
violate the civil law of the land in which he
dwells; that he may violate the rules and
regulations of a well-ordered family; and yet,
though all these courses of conduct are grievous
wrongs which shock the parent, not be
as culpable as when he treads on the feelings
of the parent. There are exigencies in which
the child flies, as it were, in the heart of the
father and other, and does not so much
violate their command as their living feeling;
intolerable and more flagrant than simply
setting aside and forgetting or transgressing a
law. In other words, it is possible to break a
statute; that is one kind of transgression. It
is possible, also, to sin by directly infringing
upon the heart and the feeling; that is
another kind of transgression, and one that is
considered more stinging, more intolerable,
and more unforgivable than any other.</p>

<p>Now God and His law are one, in the
sense in which we approach Him as moral
beings&mdash;one in such a sense that when we
offend against His moral law, we offend
against His own personal feeling. He is not
a magistrate for whom a system has been
framed, and to the administration of which He
comes under a sense of justice. He is a universal
Father, administering according to His
own instincts, His own tastes, His own affections,
His own feelings, among His children.
<span class="pagenum" id="p31">[p.&nbsp;31]</span>
God&rsquo;s law is God&rsquo;s self, pervading the universe,
and our transgression is a personal
affront of God Himself. Just as when your
taste, or your love, or your conscience, is violated
by the direct act of another person
against yourself, the offence is greater than if
any exterior canon were broken; so it is
when we violate the Divine commands.</p>

<p>This conception of God should quicken
every moral sensibility, and make a life of sin
painful and distasteful to us. It is one thing
to sin against a government, and another
thing to sin against a being. There are a
great many children that will sin against the
family arrangements, who would not sin
against their mother. There is many a child
to whom the mother says, &ldquo;My dear child,
you know your father has made a law in this
family, that such and such things shall not be
done, and you know you have broken that
law three of four times; now, for my sake,
avoid breaking it again.&rdquo; The child feels,
when the mother interposes herself, that there
is something that touches him which did not
when it was only a law of the family that he
was setting aside.</p>

<p>Now, God puts Himself in just that position,
and the motive of obedience and righteousness
is this: that God is the tenderest, the most
patient, the gentlest, and the dearest friend
that we have; that He knows everything
within and without; and that though we are
sinful and wicked, He, in His infinite compassion
and mercy, forgives us, and says, &ldquo;Do
not sin against me, nor against mine.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Beecher.</i></p>

<p>When a man defrauds you in weight, he sins
against <i>you,</i> not against the scales, which are
only the instruments of determining true and
false weight. When men sin, it is against
God, and not against His law, which is but
the indicator of right and wrong. You care
little for sins against God&rsquo;s law. It has no
blood in its veins, no sensibility. Now, every
sin that you commit is personal to God, and
not merely an infraction of His <i>laws.</i> It is
casting javelins and arrows of base desire into
His loving bosom. I think no truth can be
discovered which would be so powerful upon
the moral sense of men, as that which should
disclose to them that sinning is always a
personal offense against a personal God. Law
without is only an echo of God&rsquo;s heart-beat
within.&mdash;<i>Beecher.</i></p></div>

<div class="footnote" id="o20_fn3"><p><a href="#o20_fna3"><span class="label">[3]</span></a>
Is there any human being who so hates the
sin of a child, or the companion of that friend?
To whose eye so much as to the eye of the
lover is a defect a thing to be abhorred? Is
there anywhere in the world such compassion
as is found in a father or in a mother over the
sin or fault of the child? Yea, with evil
associates, with growing bluntness of feeling,
with accumulating evasions and deceits, with
a development of serpent passions, with a life
by day and by night that emasculates manliness,
the mother sees her boy going steadily
down, step by step; and in her nightly vigils,
with strong crying and tears, she pours herself
out before God, abhorring with unutterable
detestation all these terrible evils that threaten
the life and immortality of her son; and for
years she carries in her soul the suffering that
ought to be in his, and bears his sin, his
sorrow, and his shame, and lies humiliated,
and bowed down in the dust, the just for the
unjust.&mdash;<i>Beecher.</i></p>

<p>God hates sin, because it destroys what
He loves. He could live high and lifted up
above all noise of man&rsquo;s groaning, all smoke
of his torment; but His nature is to come
down after man&mdash;to grope for him amid all
the dark pollutions of sin, and, if possible, to
rescue and cleanse him.</p>

<p>God hates sin very much, as mothers hate
wild beasts. One day a woman stood washing
beside a stream. She was in a wild frontier
country, and the woods were all around. Her
little, only child was playing about near her.
By and by she missed the infant&rsquo;s prattle, and,
looking about, she called its name. There
was no answer. Alarmed, the mother ran to
the house, but her babe was not there. In
wild distress the poor woman now fled to
search the woods, and there she found her
child. But it was only its little <i>body</i> that she
clasped to her heart. A wolf had seized her
treasure, and when, at last, she rescued it from
those bloody fangs, its spirit had gone. Oh,
how that mother hated wolves! And do you
know that this is the very figure Christ uses
to show what feeling He has towards the sin
that is seeking to devour His children?&mdash;<i>Beecher.</i></p>

<p>It makes a difference to God how we act.
His happiness is affected by the conduct of His
children; for His heart is the heart of a father.
If, when my child sins, a pang goes through
my own soul, and I fly to rescue him from
further iniquity, it is because God struck into
my breast a little spark of what in Him is
infinite.&mdash;<i>Beecher.</i></p></div>

A group of rough men were assembled
at a tavern one night. One man boasted that
it did not make any difference what time he
went home, his wife cheerfully opened the door,
and provided an entertainment if he was
hungry when he got home. So they laid a
wager. They said: &ldquo;Now, we&rsquo;ll go along
with you. So much shall be wagered. We&rsquo;ll
bet so much that when you go home, and
make such a demand, she will resist it.&rdquo; So
they went along at two or three o&rsquo;clock in the
morning and knocked at the door. The door
opened, and the man said to the wife: &ldquo;Get us
a supper.&rdquo; She said: &ldquo;What shall I get?&rdquo;
He selected the articles of food. Very cheerfully
were they provided, and about three or
four o&rsquo;clock in the morning they sat down at
the table&mdash;the most cheerful one in all that
company the Christian wife&mdash;when the man,
the ruffian, the villain, who had demanded all
<span class="pagenum" id="p32">[p.&nbsp;32]</span>
this, broke down and said: &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t stand
this. O what a wretch I am!&rdquo; He disbanded
that group. He knelt down with his Christian
wife and asked her to pray for the salvation of
his immortal soul, and before the morning
dawned they were united in the faith and hope
of the Gospel. A patient, loving, Christian
demeanour in the presence of transgression,
in the presence of hardness, in the presence
of obduracy and crime, is an argument from
the throne of the Lord Almighty.&mdash;<i>Talmage.</i></p></div>

Since we know God to be grievously
displeased with sin, here is something awful
in His keeping silence while it is committed
under His eye. If a child comes home conscious
of having offended a parent, and the parent
says nothing all that night, but merely looks
very grave, the child is more frightened than
he would be by a sharp rebuke or severe
punishment, for if such rebuke or punishment
were inflicted, he would at least know the
worst; but when the parent is silent, he knows
not what may be hanging over him. So when
we remember how many things plainly offensive
to God are going on all around us, it is a
terrible thought that He is still silent. We
fear that He is but getting ready to take vengeance
on those who defy Him. And so that
passage which we have quoted from the Psalms
carries on the train of thought in what follows.
&ldquo;God is a righteous judge, strong and patient,
and God is provoked every day. If a man will
not turn, He will whet His sword, He hath bent
His bow, and made it ready.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In countries where earthquakes happen, a
dead silence always goes before the earthquake.
Nature seems hushed into an awful stillness,
as if she were holding her breath at the thought
of the coming disaster. The air hangs
heavily; not a breath fans the leaves; the
birds make no music; there is no hum of
insects; there is no ripple of streams; and
this while whole houses, and even cities sometimes,
are hanging on the brink of ruin. So
it is with God&rsquo;s silence,&mdash;it will be followed,
when it seems deepest, by the earthquake of
His judgments. And so the holy Apostle
writes to the Thessalonians: &ldquo;When they
shall say, Peace and safety&rdquo; (from the fact of
God&rsquo;s being so still and so dumb), &ldquo;Then
sudden destruction cometh upon them, as
travail upon a woman with child, and they
shall not escape.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Goulburn.</i></p></div>

<p class="bq">i.&nbsp;15. <i>And when ye spread forth your hands, I will hide mine eyes from you;
yea, when ye make many prayers, I will not hear.</i></p>

<p>The Jews had been likened unto the
inhabitants of Sodom and Gomorrah
(ver. 10). As such, they are summoned
to listen to a series of declarations
of which this is the sum, that worship
without holiness is a solemn mockery.
Confining ourselves to our text only,
we may see that it teaches us&mdash;<b>I. The
worthlessness of ritualism without
spirituality.</b> &ldquo;When ye spread forth
your hands,&rdquo; &amp;c. 1.&nbsp;<i>Ritualism is an essential
element of public worship.</i> There must
be some form by which thought can be
expressed, and the devotions of others
guided. There may be too little, or
too much, but <i>some</i> is
<span class="wsnw">indispensable.<a id="o21_fna1" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#o21_fn1">[1]</a></span>
2.&nbsp;<i>Ritualism may be the expression of
earnest spiritual life, and a help thereto.</i>
It may be the outcome of a sincere feeling
and deep piety&mdash;such was the ritual
which David and his devout companions
devised and elaborated for the
service of the Temple. It was costly
and magnificent beyond even that
which is observed in St. Peter&rsquo;s at
Rome; but as practised by them it was
as spiritual as the baldest service that
has ever been conducted in the barest
conventicle. A splendid ritual may be
acceptable to the Most High, and the
followers of George Fox must not
imagine that they are the only persons
who worship God &ldquo;in spirit and in
truth.&rdquo; 3.&nbsp;But <i>ritualism may be, and
often is, only a form.</i> It may mean only
an exhibition of millinery, a scrupulous
observance of a prescribed series of
postures and genuflexions. It may be,
according to a too suggestive phrase,
merely a service &ldquo;performed.&rdquo; In this
case God passes it by with contempt.
To all engaged in such histrionic performances
He says, &ldquo;When ye spread
forth your hands,&rdquo; &amp;c. Supplication
without desire will never draw down
the Divine benediction. <b>II.&nbsp;The worthlessness
of prayer without purity of
heart.</b> &ldquo;When ye make many prayers,
I will not hear.&rdquo; 1.&nbsp;<i>Prayer is a necessity
of the Christian life.</i> A consciousness
of weakness and want, and a profound
conviction of God&rsquo;s power and
willingness to succour him, prompts
the Christian to make &ldquo;many prayers.&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum" id="p33">[p.&nbsp;33]</span>
And each supplication so inspired finds
its way to the throne and heart of God.
To hear and answer the prayers of His
children is one of our Heavenly Father&rsquo;s
joys (ch. lxv.&nbsp;24). 2.&nbsp;<i>But prayer, like
ritualism, instead of being the expression
of a realised need, may be only an empty
form.</i> The supplications that are
offered may be uttered merely by rote,
with as little feeling as a child recites
the multiplication-table; or they may
be devices by which deluded men seek
to propitiate that God whom they are
offending by their conduct every day,&mdash;mere
lip-homage, which they imagine
He will accept in condonation of their
habitual disregard of His will. In
either case, their &ldquo;many prayers&rdquo; are
worthless husks which He rejects with
disdain.</p>

<p>If we would have our worship
accepted of God, there must be&mdash;1.&nbsp;<i>Spiritual
conceptions of His character.</i>
These will prevent us from mocking
Him by merely formal prayers or
praises. 2.&nbsp;<i>A solemn realisation of His
presence.</i> How often this is lacking in
those who take part in the service of
the sanctuary, and even in those who
conduct them! But God is not throned
in some distant heaven, to which our
prayers struggle up we know not how:
He is <span class="smcap">here</span>! We shall never be nearer
to Him than we are to-day! 3.&nbsp;<i>An
earnest endeavour after holiness in daily
life</i> (Ps. lxvi.&nbsp;18). See why God would
not regard the uplifted hands of the
Jewish supplicants&mdash;&ldquo;Your hands are
full of blood.&rdquo; See also ch. lix.&nbsp;1&ndash;3.
To no rebel is access to the presence-chamber
of the King of kings granted:
this is the high privilege of those only
who can lift up &ldquo;holy hands&rdquo; (1&nbsp;Tim.

The external part of religion is, doubtless,
of little value in comparison with the
internal; and so is the cask in comparison
with the wine contained in it: but if the cask
be staved, the wine must perish. If there
were no Sundays or holydays, no ministers,
no churches or religious assemblies, no prayers
or sacraments, no Scriptures read, or sermons
preached, how long would there be any religion
left in the world: and who would desire to live
in a world where there was none?&mdash;<i>Horne,</i>
1730&ndash;1792.</p>

<p>Forms are necessary to religion as the means
of its manifestation. As the invisible God
manifests His nature&mdash;His power, wisdom, and
goodness, in visible material forms, in the
bright orbs of heaven, in the everlasting hills,
in the broad earth with its fruits and flowers,
and in all the living things which He has
made,&mdash;so the invisible soul of man reveals
its convictions and feelings in the outward
acts which it performs. As there could be no
knowledge of God without the visible forms in
which He reveals Himself, so there could be
no knowledge of the religion which exists in
the soul of man without the outward forms in
which it expresses itself. A form is the flag,
the banner, the symbol of an inward life, it is to
a religious belief what the body is to the soul;
as the soul would be utterly unknown without
the body, so religion would be unknown without
its forms, a light hidden under a bushel,
and not set up in a candlestick that it may
give light to all that are in the house.</p>

<p>Forms are necessary not only to the manifestation
of religion, but to its nourishment
and continued existence. A religion which
expressed itself in no outward word or act
would soon die out of the soul altogether. The
attempt to embody truth and feeling, to express
it in words and actions, is necessary to
give it the character of living principle in the
soul: in this respect forms are like the healthy
exercise which at once expresses and increases
the vigorous life of the body, or they may be
compared to the leaves of a tree, which not
only proceed from its inward life, but catch
the vitalising influences of the light, the rain
and the atmosphere, and convey them down
to the root.</p>

<p>What, then, is that formalism which is
everywhere in the Scripture, and especially in
the discourses of our Lord, described as an
offence and an abomination in the sight of
God? I answer, formalism is the substitution
of the outward rite in the place of the inner
spirit and life of the soul; it is the green leaf
which still hangs upon the dead branch which
has been lopped off.&mdash;<i>David Loxton.</i></p></div>

God doth not institute worship-ordinances
for bodily motion only; when He
speaketh to men He speaketh as to a man,
and requireth human actions from him, even
the work of the soul, and not the words of a
parrot or the motion of a puppet.&mdash;<i>Baxter,</i>
1615&ndash;1691.</p>

<p>You think you serve God by coming to
church; but if you refuse to let the Word convert
you, how should God be pleased with such
a service as this? It is as if you should tell
your servant what you have for him to do, and
because he hath given you the hearing, he
thinks he should have his wages, though he
do nothing of that which you set him to do.
Were not this an unreasonable servant? Or
would you give him according to his expectation?
It is a strange thing that man should
think that God will save them for dissembling
<span class="pagenum" id="p34">[p.&nbsp;34]</span>
with Him; and save them for abusing His
name and ordinances. Every time you hear,
or pray, or praise God, or receive the sacrament,
while you deny God your heart and
remain unconverted, you do but despise Him
and show more of your rebellion than your
obedience. Would you take him for a good
tenant that at every rent-day would duly wait
on you, and put off his hat to you, but bring
you never a penny of rent? Or would you
take him for a good debtor that brings you
nothing but an empty purse, and expects you
should take that for payment? God biddeth
you come to church and hear the Word; and
so you do, and so far you do well; but withal,
He chargeth you to suffer the Word to work
upon your hearts, and to take it home and consider
of it, and obey it, and cast away
from former courses, and give your hearts and lives
to Him; and this you will not do. And you
think that He will accept of your service?&mdash;<i>Baxter,</i>

<h3 class="tdc" id="o22"><span class="smcap">Reasons for the Rejection of Prayer.</span></h3>

<p class="bq">i.&nbsp;15. <i>When ye make many prayers, I will not hear.</i></p>

<p>God has characterised Himself as
&ldquo;the Hearer of prayer;&rdquo; and it is
the great consolation of His people
that they cannot seek His face in vain.
But here He declares that He will not
hear the prayers of Israel, however
many. This solemn and momentous
declaration may well lead us to inquire
why prayer is, in many instances, rejected.
Prayer, to be heard, must be
both <i>right</i> and <i>real.</i> If it possess
neither of these characteristics, or only
one of them&mdash;if it is <i>neither right nor
real,</i> or is <i>right without being real,</i> or <i>real
without being right</i>&mdash;it cannot fail to be
rejected.</p>

<p>I. A man may pray <i>rightly,</i> either
because he has been taught the principles
of orthodoxy, or knows what
language is conformable to those principles,
or because he uses prayers composed
by spiritual men, or, finally,
because he used the very word prescribed
or sanctioned by God Himself.
But in all these cases, while his prayer
may be right, it may be altogether
unreal. He may neither know the
meaning of the requests it contains,
nor desire their
<span class="wsnw">fulfilment.<a id="o22_fna1" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#o22_fn1">[1]</a></span>
Thus do many men pray for a free pardon
for Christ&rsquo;s sake, for entire sanctification,
and repeat the Lord&rsquo;s Prayer.
There is nothing in the heart corresponding
to what is expressed by the
lips; nay, the heart and the mouth are
often completely at variance with each
other.</p>

<p>II. Prayer may be <i>real without being
right.</i> A man may really acknowledge
mercies received, and petition for more;
and yet neither the acknowledgement
nor the petition may be regarded by
God. The acknowledgement and the
petition have reference to mere earthly
desires already gratified or yet to be
gratified. He thanks God that the
&ldquo;lusts have had the food which they
craved;&rdquo; he prays that they may never
want it. Pride, vanity, the love of
ease, pleasures, and worldly respectability
are &ldquo;lusts&rdquo; on which he has
hitherto &ldquo;consumed,&rdquo; and on which
he intends still to &ldquo;consume,&rdquo; the good
things which God has given, or may
yet give him. The secret soul of all
his supplications is not any zeal for
the glory of God, but selfishness. His
prayers are of the earth, earthy. The
spiritual blessings which God holds
out in His right hand he passes by in
contemptuous neglect, and clamours
for the natural blessings which are in
God&rsquo;s left hand.</p>

<p>III. Both the faults of prayer above
referred to are often found in one and
the same individual, and the guilt of
both accumulated on one and the same
head.</p>

<p>Let it not be inferred from what has
been said that we lay an interdict on
natural blessings, and forbid the seeking
of them in prayer. Our Saviour
has given us authority to ask for daily
bread, and this fully warrants the conclusion
that natural blessings, as well
as spiritual, may and ought to form a
subject of prayer. We ought to &ldquo;seek
<i>first</i> the kingdom of God and His righteousness,&rdquo;
and <i>then</i> ask Him to fulfil
His promise of &ldquo;adding unto us all
other things.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>R. Nesbit, Discourses,</i>
pp. 308&ndash;319.</p>

Will men&rsquo;s prayers be answered? Not
if they pray as boys whittle sticks&mdash;silently,
hardly knowing or caring what they are about.
I have known men begin to pray about Adam,
and go on from him to the present time, whittling
their stick clear to a point, with about as
much feeling, and doing about as much good
as the boy does.&mdash;<i>Beecher.</i></p>

<h3 class="tdc" id="o23"><span class="smcap">A Startling Charge.</span></h3>

<p class="bq">i.&nbsp;15. <i>Your hands are full of blood.</i></p>

<p>Such is the reason which God assigns
for turning a deaf ear to the prayers
of His ancient people: the hands they
lifted up to Him in supplication were
blood-stained. It was as if Cain, red
with the murder of Abel, had lifted
up his hands in prayer to God for
blessing. By this startling charge we
are reminded&mdash;<b>I.&nbsp;That between the
estimates formed by God and man as
to what takes place in the sanctuary
there is often an infinite disparity.</b>
Behold the court of the temple filled,
apparently, with devout worshippers,
who lift up their hands to heaven in
earnest supplication,&mdash;what a pleasing
sight! But God looks down, and says,
&ldquo;Those hands are full of blood.&rdquo; The
same contrast is repeated in another
form (ch. xxix.&nbsp;13). Other contrasts:
Eli sees what he thinks to be a drunken
woman; God sees a humble supplicant
(1&nbsp;Sam. i.&nbsp;12, 13). Men see an eminently
religious man praying in the
sanctuary; God sees a man prostituting
prayer into a means of self-glorification
(Luke xviii.&nbsp;11, 12). Men see a foul
wretch whose presence in the sanctuary
is a pollution; God sees a broken-hearted
penitent, and hastens to bless
him (Luke xviii.&nbsp;13, 14). So it is in
our sanctuaries to-day. <b>II.&nbsp;That God
holds us responsible for the ultimate
consequences of our actions.</b> The men
who thronged the temple in Isaiah&rsquo;s
time, and whose prayers God rejected,
were not bandits and murderers in the
ordinary and coarse fashion by which
men are brought to the scaffold. Yet
the charge brought against them was
true. For there are other ways of
murdering men than by acts of violence
of which human law takes note. By
grievous oppression millions of men
have been brought to an untimely
grave. If a man destroys another by
<i>slow</i> poison, is he not as truly a murderer
as another who kills his victim by means
of prussic acid? In God&rsquo;s sight oppression
is murder; and of oppression in its
worst forms the Jews had been guilty
(vers. 23; iii.&nbsp;14, 15, &amp;c.) It is in
accordance with this declaration that
opprobrium is heaped upon Jeroboam
as the man &ldquo;who made Israel to sin&rdquo;
(2&nbsp;Kings x.&nbsp;29); and that we are so
sternly warned against leading
others into transgression (Matt. xviii.&nbsp;6, &amp;c.)
This fact&mdash;1.&nbsp;<i>Casts some light on the doctrine
of future punishment.</i> The results
of the evil actions of men go on eternally
propagating themselves, and it is therefore
not unjust that the punishment of
those actions should be eternal also.
2.&nbsp;<i>Should cause us to halt when we are
tempted to acts of unkindness and oppression.</i>
Unwillingly we may thereby
become murderers. 3.&nbsp;<i>Should lead us
to be most watchful as to the example we
set before others.</i> If we hold our false
lights by which they are caused to
make shipwreck &ldquo;concerning faith&rdquo; and
character, God will hold us responsible
for the disaster (Rom. xiv.&nbsp;15, &amp;c.)
<b>III.&nbsp;That sin is naturally indelible.</b>
These Jews came into the sanctuary
with hands carefully cleansed, but yet
in God&rsquo;s sight they were &ldquo;full of blood.&rdquo;
1.&nbsp;The stains of sin cannot be washed
out by <i>time.</i> Time obliterates much,
but it does not obliterate guilt. Men
are apt to be troubled in conscience
<span class="pagenum" id="p36">[p.&nbsp;36]</span>
about recent sins, but to be at ease concerning
those committed many years
previously. But this is a mistake.
Lapse of time makes no difference to
God; the inscriptions in His books of
record never fade. Hence the wisdom
of David&rsquo;s prayer (Ps. xxv.&nbsp;7). 2.&nbsp;The
stain of sin cannot be washed out by
<i>worship.</i> That it might be so was the
vain dream of the Jews, as it is of
millions to-day. But worship itself is
an offence when it is offered by ungodly
men; so far from diminishing their
guilt, it increases it (Prov. xxviii.&nbsp;9,
&amp;c.) 3.&nbsp;The stain of sin cannot be
washed out by <i>sorrow.</i> Sorrow for the
past alters nothing in the past; the
crime remains, no matter how many
tears the criminal may <span class="wsnw">shed.<a id="o23_fna1" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#o23_fn1">[1]</a></span>
4.&nbsp;The stain of sin cannot be washed out
even by <i>reformation of conduct and character.</i>
Men speak of &ldquo;turning over a
new leaf,&rdquo; and when they have done
what this phrase implies, they are apt
to be at peace. But this also is a mistake.
They forget that the old, evil
leaf remains, and that for what is
inscribed thereon God will call them
to account. As there is a &ldquo;godly
sorrow&rdquo; and a &ldquo;worldly sorrow,&rdquo; so
there is a religious and an irreligious
reformation of conduct. The former
is the result of evangelical repentance,
and is of exceeding worth (Ezek. xviii.&nbsp;27, 28);
the latter is a mere act of
prudence, and is of no moral account.
In one way, and in one way only, can
the stain of guilt be effaced from the
human soul (1&nbsp;John i.&nbsp;7&ndash;9).</p>

Repentance <i>qualifies</i> a man for pardon
but does not, cannot <i>entitle</i> him to it. It
is one of the most elementary and obvious
truths of morality, that the performance of
one duty cannot be any compensation for
neglect to perform another duty. But when
a sinner is penitent for his sins, he is merely
doing what, <i>as a sinner,</i> he ought to do; and
his feelings of contrition do no more to absolve
him from his guilt than the gratitude a man
feels to a doctor who has cured him from a
dangerous illness does to discharge the doctor&rsquo;s
bill. As in this case there ought to be both
gratitude and payment, so in the case of the
sinner there must be both penitence and atonement.
The sinner&rsquo;s sorrow for his sin, while
in itself a proper thing, is no more an atonement
for his sin than is the remorse that fills
the breasts of most murderers any atonement
for the murders they have committed. Judas
was sorry, profoundly and intensely sorry, for
having betrayed our Lord Jesus Christ, but did
<i>that</i> do away with the guilt of that betrayal?
Was Peter not to be blamed for his denial of
his Master, because afterwards &ldquo;he went out
and wept bitterly&rdquo;? Did the tears he shed
give him any right to say in after years&mdash;&ldquo;Yes,
I denied my Lord, but I was sorry for it, and
so made it straight&rdquo;? Do you think that just
as with soap and water you can wash the dirt
off your hands, you can with a few tears, or
with many tears, wash the guilt of sin from
off your soul? No delusion could be more
groundless. Oh no! You have the real fact
and the true philosophy of the matter in the
well-known verse&mdash;</p>

<p class="bqpoemr">&ldquo;Not the labours of my hands<br />
&nbsp;Can fulfil Thy law&rsquo;s demands.<br />
&nbsp;Could my zeal no respite know,<br />
&nbsp;<i>Could my tears for ever flow,</i><br />
&nbsp;All for sin could not atone:<br />
&nbsp;<span class="smcap">Thou</span> must save, and <span class="smcap">Thou</span> alone.&rdquo;</p></div>
</div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 class="tdc" id="o24"><span class="smcap">Moral Ablution.</span></h3>

<p class="bq">i.&nbsp;16. <i>Wash you, make you clean.</i></p>

<p>This is one of a very numerous class of
passages which summon sinners to the
duty of moral purification, of thorough
and complete reformation of character
(Jer. iv.&nbsp;14; James iv.&nbsp;8; Jer. xviii.&nbsp;11;
Ezek. xviii.&nbsp;30-32, &amp;c.) These passages
are very clear and emphatic, but
they seem to be in opposition to others
which assert man&rsquo;s natural inability to
do anything that is good (Matt vii.&nbsp;18;
Rom. vii.&nbsp;18&ndash;23; John xv.&nbsp;5), with
others which teach that repentance is
a Divine gift (Acts v.&nbsp;31; 2&nbsp;Tim. ii.&nbsp;25),
and with those which teach that
sanctification is the work of the Holy
Spirit (1&nbsp;Cor. vi.&nbsp;11, &amp;c.) The
opposition is only <span class="wsnw">apparent.<a id="o24_fna1" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#o24_fn1">[1]</a></span>
Every Divine command really involves a promise
of the grace necessary for its
accomplishment, and God is ever ready
to work with and in us &ldquo;to will and
to do of His good <span class="wsnw">pleasure.&rdquo;<a id="o24_fna2" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#o24_fn2">[2]</a></span>
Fallen as we are, we yet retain the power of
responding to or of rejecting His
admonitions; if we respond to them,
there instantly begins to flow into our
<span class="pagenum" id="p37">[p.&nbsp;37]</span>
souls that which will enable us to
accomplish everything that God has
required (Phil. iv.&nbsp;13). Three great
questions&mdash;<b>I.&nbsp;Why must we cleanse
ourselves from evil?</b> 1.&nbsp;<i>Because sin
renders us offensive to God.</i> It is in
itself repulsive to Him, just as immodesty
in all its forms and in every
degree is repulsive to a virtuous woman
(Hab. i.&nbsp;13; Prov. xxxi.&nbsp;10&ndash;31). 2.&nbsp;<i>Because it is destructive
to ourselves.</i> In physical matters dirt
and disease are inseparable, and so they
are in spiritual. Moral pollution leads
to moral decay. Sin is a leprosy that
eats away all the finer faculties of the
soul. 3.&nbsp;<i>Because it renders us dangerous
to our fellow-men.</i> In the measure that
we are corrupt, we shall corrupt others.
There is a terrible contagiousness in
iniquity (Prov. xxii.&nbsp;24, 25; Rev. xviii.&nbsp;4).
A sinner is a walking pestilence.
And 4.&nbsp;The special lesson of our text
in its connection&mdash;<i>Because otherwise
access to the throne of grace will be closed
against us.</i> If it be not so with us now,
yet there will come a season when it
will be supremely important to us that
God should hear our prayers (a time of
great trouble, or the hour of death),
and how awful will be our condition if
God should then turn a deaf ear to us!
But this is the doom of obdurate sinners
(ver. 15; Jer. xi.&nbsp;14, &amp;c.) <b>II.&nbsp;How
may we cleanse ourselves from
evil?</b> 1.&nbsp;<i>By resolutely putting off our
old evil habits.</i> This is what Isaiah
exhorted the Jews to do (vers. 16, 17).
Similar exhortations occur in the New
Testament (Eph. iv.&nbsp;25&ndash;29; Heb. xii.&nbsp;1).
Begin with the faults of which you
are most <span class="wsnw">conscious.<a id="o24_fna3" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#o24_fn3">[3]</a></span>
Begin and continue
the great task of moral reformation
in humble dependence upon God.
2.&nbsp;<i>By prayer.</i> In earnest communion
with God our views of duty and purity
receive a marvellous elevation, and
we catch the inspiration of the Divine
character, so that iniquity, instead of
being attractive, becomes hateful to us
<span class="wsnw">also.<a id="o24_fna4" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#o24_fn4">[4]</a></span>
3.&nbsp;<i>By humble but resolute endeavours
to copy the example of our Lord
Jesus Christ.</i> 4.&nbsp;<i>By intercourse with the people of</i>
<span class="wsnw"><i>God.</i><a id="o24_fna5" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#o24_fn5">[5]</a></span>
5.&nbsp;<i>By making the
Word of God the only and absolute rule of
our life</i> (Ps. cxix.&nbsp;1). These are the
means by which we may attain to
moral purity in the future. Cleansing
from the guilt of sin in the past is bestowed
freely on all who believe in
Jesus (1&nbsp;John i.&nbsp;7&ndash;9). Yea, the guilt
of a man whose hands are literally
&ldquo;full of blood&rdquo; may thus be washed
away; <i>e.g.,</i> Saul, the persecutor and
murderer of the saints (Acts. xxii.&nbsp;4,
16; 1&nbsp;Tim. i.&nbsp;16). <b>III.&nbsp;When may we
cleanse ourselves from evil? NOW!</b>
this very hour the task ought to be
begun. 1.&nbsp;Difficult as the task is,
delay will only increase its
<span class="wsnw">difficulty.<a id="o24_fna6" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#o24_fn6">[6]</a></span>
2.&nbsp;Now, because God&rsquo;s commands
brook no delay. (Ps. xcv.&nbsp;7, 8). 3.&nbsp;Now!
because now though God may
be willing to-day to grant you &ldquo;repentance
unto life,&rdquo; by your delay you may
so provoke Him to anger that <i>to-morrow</i>
repentance may be denied you.</p>

<div class="footnote" id="o24_fn1"><p><a href="#o24_fna1"><span class="label">[1]</span></a>
There is no contradiction between these
statements and the command to repent. Whoever
considers what repentance is,&mdash;that it is a
change of mind toward sin, so that what once
was loved is viewed with disgust, and what
was pursued with eagerness is shunned with
abhorrence,&mdash;will perceive at once that it can
only be wrought in us by a Divine power.
Man&rsquo;s natural tendencies are toward evil; and
a river could as easily arrest itself on its way
to the ocean, and climb to the sources whence
it sprang, as can man without the help of the
Holy Spirit learn to hate sin because of what
it is. &ldquo;Can the Ethiopian change his skin,
or the leopard his spots? then may ye also do
good that are accustomed to do evil.&rdquo; The
polluted fountain of our heart will never cleanse
itself. Repentance, like every other gift, must
come from the Father of lights.</p>

<p>But &ldquo;God works in us to will and to do of
His good pleasure.&rdquo; By His Holy Spirit He
strives in every human soul, awakening desires
after a better and purer life. By His longsuffering,
by messages from His Word, by the
monitions of His providence, He strives to lead
us to repentance. But <i>we</i> must repent. As
while the earth cannot bear fruit unless the
sun shine upon it, it is still the part of the
earth to be fertile; so while we cannot repent
unless God aid us, it is our part to turn from
evil. Repentance cannot be exercised <i>for</i> us;
it must be exercised <i>by</i> us.</p>

<p>God commands you to repent, just as to the
apostles, when five thousand hungry men, besides
women and children, surrounded them,
and their whole store was five loaves and two
fishes, Christ said, &ldquo;Give ye them to eat.&rdquo;
The task is as much beyond your unaided power
as that was above theirs; but address yourself
to it as they did, in obedience to the Divine
behest, and you will receive power from on
<span class="pagenum" id="p38">[p.&nbsp;38]</span>
high to accomplish not only it, but other tasks
higher yet.</p></div>

The Gospel supposeth a power going
along with it, and that the Holy Spirit works
upon the minds of men, to quicken, excite, and
assist them in their duty. If it were not so,
the exhortations of preachers would be nothing
else but a cruel and bitter mocking of sinners,
and an ironical insulting over the misery and
weakness of poor creatures, and for ministers
to preach, or people to hear sermons, upon any
other terms, would be the vainest expense of
time and the idlest thing we do all the week;
and all our dissuasives from sin, and exhortations
to holiness and a good life, and vehement
persuasions of men to strive to get to heaven,
and to escape hell, would be just as if one
should urge a blind man, by many reasons and
arguments, taken from the advantages and
comfort of that sense, and the beauty of external
objects, by all means to open his eyes, and
to behold the delights of nature, to see his way,
and to look to his steps, and should upbraid
him, and be very angry with him, for not doing
so.&mdash;<i>Tillotson,</i> 1630&ndash;1694.</p></div>

Rooting up the large weeds of a garden

There is an antipathy between sinning
and praying. The child that hath misspent
the whole day in playing abroad, steals to bed
at night for fear of a chiding from his father.
Sin and prayer are such contraries, that it is
impossible at a stride to step from one to
another. Prayer will either make you leave
off sinning, or sinning will make you leave off
prayer.&mdash;<i>Gurnall,</i> 1617&ndash;1679.</p>

<p>The first true sign of spiritual life, prayer
is also the means of maintaining it. Man can
as well live physically without breathing, as
spiritually without praying. There is a class
of animals&mdash;the cetaceous, neither fish nor sea-fowl,
that inhabit the deep. It is their home;
they never leave it for the shore; yet, though
swimming beneath its waves and sounding its
darkest depths, they have ever and anon to
rise to the surface that they may breathe the
air. Without that these monarchs of the deep
could not exist in the dense element in which
they live, and move, and have their being.
And something like what is imposed on them by
a physical necessity, the Christian has to do by
a spiritual one. It is by ever and anon ascending
up to God, by rising through prayer into
a loftier purer region for supplies of Divine
grace, that he maintains his spiritual life.
Prevent these animals from rising to the surface,
and they die for want of breath; prevent
him from rising to God, and he dies for want
of prayer. &ldquo;Give me children,&rdquo; cried Rachel,
&ldquo;or else I die.&rdquo; Let me breathe, says a man
gasping, or else I die. Let me pray, says the
Christian, or else I die.&mdash;<i>Guthrie.</i></p></div>

Get some Christian friend (whom thou
mayest trust above others) to be thy faithful
monitor. Or, that man hath a great help
for the maintaining the power of godliness
that has an open-hearted friend that dare speak
his heart to him. A stander-by sees more
sometimes by a man than the <i>actor</i> can do
by himself, and is more fit to judge of his
actions than he of his own; sometimes self-love
blinds us in our own cause, that we are over-suspicious
of the worst by ourselves, which
makes us appear to ourselves worse than we
are. Now, that thou mayest not deprive thyself
of so great help from thy friend, be more
to keep thy heart ready with meekness to receive,
yes, with thankfulness embrace a reproof
from his mouth. Those that cannot bear plain-dealing
hurt themselves most; for by this they
seldom hear the truth.&mdash;<i>Gurnalt,</i> 1617&ndash;1679.</p></div>

The more we defer, the more difficult
and painful our work must needs prove; every day
will both enlarge our task and diminish our
ability to perform it. Sin is never at a stay;
if we do not retreat from it, we shall advance
in it, and the further on we go, the more
we have to come back; every step we take forward
(even before we can return hither, into the state
wherein we are at present) must be repeated;
all the web we spin must be unravelled.</p>

<p>Vice, as it groweth in age, so it improveth
in stature and strength; from a puny child it
soon waxeth a lusty striping, then riseth to be
a sturdy man, and after awhile becometh a
massy giant, whom we shall scarce dare to encounter,
whom we shall be very hardly able to
vanquish; especially seeing that as it groweth
taller and stouter, so we shall dwindle and
prove more impotent, for it feedeth upon our
vitals, and thriveth by our decay; it waxeth
mighty by stripping us of our best forces, by
enfeebling our reason, by perverting our will,
by corrupting our temper, by debasing our
courage, by seducing all our appetites and
passions to a treacherous compliance with
itself: every day our mind groweth more
blind, our will more resty, our spirit more
faint, our passions more headstrong and untamable;
the power and empire of sin do
strangely by degrees encroach, and continually
get ground upon us, till it hath quite subdued
and enthralled us. First we learn to bear it;
then we come to like it; by and by we contract
a friendship with it; then we dote upon
it; at last we become enslaved to it in a bondage,
which we shall hardly be able, or willing,
to shake off; when not only our necks are fitted
to the yoke, our hands are manacled, and our
feet shackled thereby, but our heads and hearts
do conspire in a base submission thereto, when
vice hath made such impression on us, when
this pernicious weed hath take so deep root
in our mind, will, and affection, it will demand
an extremely toilsome labour to extirpate it.&mdash;<i>Barrow,</i>
1630&ndash;1677.</p>

<p>Repentance is entirely in God&rsquo;s disposal.
<span class="pagenum" id="p39">[p.&nbsp;39]</span>
This grace is in the soul from God, as light is
in the air from the sun, by continual emanation;
so that God may shut or open His hands,
contract or diffuse, set forth or suspend the
influences of it as He pleases. And if God gives
not repenting grace, there will be a hard heart
and a dry eye, maugre all the poor frustraneous
endeavours of nature. A piece of brass may
as easily melt, or a flint bewater itself, as the
heart of man, by any innate power of its own,
resolve itself into a penitential humiliation.
If God does not, by an immediate blow of His
omnipotence, strike the rock, these waters will
never gush out. The Spirit blows where it
listeth, and if that blows not, these showers
can never fall.</p>

<p>And now, if the matter stands so, how does
the impenitent sinner know but that God,
being provoked by his present impenitence,
may irrevocably propose within Himself to
seal up these fountains, and shut him up under
hardness of heart and reprobation of sense?
And then farewell all thoughts of repentance
for ever.&mdash;<i>South,</i> 1633&ndash;1716.</p></div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 class="tdc" id="o25"><span class="smcap">A Plain Command.</span></h3>

<p class="bq">i.&nbsp;16. <i>Cease to do evil.</i></p>

<p>One of the pretexts by which wicked
men endeavour to excuse their neglect
of religion is, that many of the doctrines
of the Bible are mysterious.
They are so necessarily, and that they
are so is one proof that the Bible is
from God. But however mysterious
the doctrines of Scripture may be, its
precepts are plain enough. How plain
is the command of our text! No man
can even pretend that he does not
understand it. If he does not obey it,
he will not be able to plead that it is
beyond his comprehension. We have&mdash;<b>I.&nbsp;A
universal requirement.</b> Certain
of the precepts of Scripture concern
only certain classes of individuals
(sovereigns, subjects, husbands, wives,
&amp;c.), but this command concerns us
all. Your name is written above it,
and it is a message for <i>you.</i> <b>II.&nbsp;A
most reasonable requirement.</b> It is
wrong that needs justification, not
right. The worst man in the community
will admit that he <i>ought</i> to
&ldquo;cease to do evil.&rdquo; And he <i>can,</i> if he
will, not in his own strength, but in
that which God is ever ready to impart
to every man who desires to turn from
sin. And not only ought and can
men &ldquo;cease to do evil,&rdquo; it will be to
their advantage to do so. Sin has its
&ldquo;pleasures,&rdquo; but they are but &ldquo;for a
season,&rdquo; and they are succeeded by
pains and penalties so intense that the
pleasures will be altogether forgotten.
To exhort men to &ldquo;cease to do evil,&rdquo;
is to exhort them to cease laying the
foundation for future
<span class="wsnw">misery.<a id="o25_fna1" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#o25_fn1">[1]</a></span>
On every ground, therefore, this is a most
reasonable requirement. <b>III.&nbsp;A comprehensive
requirement.</b> It is not
from certain forms of evil, merely, but
from evil in all its forms, that we are
required to abstain. &ldquo;Cease to do
<span class="wsnw"><i>evil!</i>&rdquo;<a id="o25_fna2" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#o25_fn2">[2]</a></span>
Sin must be utterly forsaken!
not great and flagrant sins only, but
also what are called &ldquo;little
<span class="wsnw">sins.&rdquo;<a id="o25_fna3" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#o25_fn3">[3]</a></span>
These destroy more than great
<span class="wsnw">sins.<a id="o25_fna4" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#o25_fn4">[4]</a></span>
One sin is enough to keep us enslaved
to <span class="wnsw">Satan.<a id="o25_fna5" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#o25_fn5">[5]</a></span>
<b>IV.&nbsp;An imperative requirement.</b>
This is not a counsel,
which we are at liberty to accept or
reject; it is a command, which we disobey
at our peril; a command of One
who has full power to make His authority
respected. <b>V.&nbsp;A very elementary
requirement.</b> Men who have laid
aside certain evil habits, such as
drunkenness, swearing, &amp;c., are apt
to plume themselves on what they
have done, and to regard themselves
as paragons of virtue. But this is a
mistake. Ceasing to do evil is but the
beginning of a better life; it is but
the pulling up of the weeds in a
garden, and much more than this is
needed before &ldquo;a garden&rdquo; can be
worthy of the name. Those who have
ceased to do evil must &ldquo;learn to do
<span class="wsnw">well.&rdquo;<a id="o25_fna6" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#o25_fn6">[6]</a></span></p>

As where punishment is there was sin;
so where sin is there will be, there must be,
punishment. &ldquo;If thou dost ill,&rdquo; saith God to
Cain, &ldquo;sin lies at thy door&rdquo; (Gen. iv.&nbsp;7).
<i>Sin,</i> that is <i>punishment</i> for sin; they are so
inseparable, that one word implies both; for
the doing ill is the sin, that is within doors;
but the suffering ill is the punishment, and
that lies like a fierce mastiff at the door, and
is ready to fly in our throat when we look forth,
<span class="pagenum" id="p40">[p.&nbsp;40]</span>
and, if it do not then seize upon us, yet it dogs
us at the heels; and will be sure to fasten
upon us at our greatest disadvantage: <span lang="la">Tum
gravior c&ugrave;m tarda venit, &amp;c.</span> Joseph&rsquo;s brethren
had done heinously ill: what becomes of their
sin? It makes no noise, but follows them
slily and silently in the wilderness: It follows
them home to their father&rsquo;s house; it follows
them into Egypt. All this while there is no
news of it; but when it found them cooped up
three days in Pharaoh&rsquo;s ward, now it bays at
them, and flies in their faces. &ldquo;We are
verily guilty concerning our brother, in that we
saw the anguish of his soul,&rdquo; &amp;c. (Gen. xlii.&nbsp;21).</p>

<p>What should I instance in that, whereof not
Scripture, not books, but the whole world, is full&mdash;the
inevitable sequences of sin and punishment?
Neither can it be otherwise &ldquo;Shall
not the Judge of all the earth do right?&rdquo; saith
Abraham. <i>Right,</i> is to give every one his due:
wages is due to work; now &ldquo;the wages of sin
is death:&rdquo; So then, it stands upon no less
ground than very necessary and essential
justice to God, that where wickedness hath
led the way, there punishment must follow.&mdash;<i>Hall,</i>
1574&ndash;1656.</p></div>

<div class="footnote" id="o25_fn2"><p><a href="#o25_fna2"><span class="label">[2]</span></a>
There may be a forsaking of a particular
sin that has been delightful and predominant
without sincerity towards God, for another
lust may have got possession of the heart, and
take the throne. There is an alternate succession
of appetites in the corrupt nature,
according to the change of men&rsquo;s temper or
interests in the world. As seeds sown in
that order in a garden, that &rsquo;tis always full of
a succession of fruits and herbs in season;
so original sin that is sown in our nature is
productive of divers lusts, some in the spring,
others in the summer of our age, some in the
autumn, others in the winter. Sensual lusts
flourish in youth, but when mature age has
cooled these desires, worldly lusts succeed; in
old age there is no relish for sensuality, but
covetousness reigns imperiously. Now he that
expels one sin and entertains another continues
in a state of sin; &rsquo;tis but exchanging
one familiar for another; or, to borrow the
prophet&rsquo;s expression, <span class="wsnw">&ldquo;&thinsp;&rsquo;Tis</span> as one should fly
from a lion, and meet with a bear that will as
certainly devour him.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Salter.</i></p></div>

<div class="footnote" id="o25_fn3"><p><a href="#o25_fna3"><span class="label">[3]</span></a>
Thou dost not hate sin if thou only
hatest some one sin. All iniquity will be
distasteful in thy sight if God the Holy Spirit
has really made them to loathe iniquity. If it
say to a person, &ldquo;I will not receive you into
my house when you come dressed in such a
coat;&rdquo; but if I open the door to him when he
has on another suit which is more respectable,
it is evident that my objection was not to the
person, but to his clothes. If a man will not
cheat when the transaction is open to the world,
but will do so in a more secret way, or in a
kind of adulteration which is winked at in the
trade, the man does not hate cheating, he
only hates that kind of it which is sure to be
found out; he likes the thing itself very well.
Some sinners, they say they hate sin. Not at
all; sin in its essence is pleasing enough, it
is only a glaring shape of it which they dislike.&mdash;<i>Spurgeon.</i></p>

<p>If we would realise the full force of the
term &ldquo;hatred of evil,&rdquo; as it ought to exist in all,
as it would exist in a perfectly righteous man,
we shall do well to consider how sensitive we
are to natural evil in its every form to pain
and suffering and misfortune. How delicately
is the physical frame of man constructed, and
how keenly is that slightest derangement in
any part of it felt! A little mote in the eye,
hardly discernible by the eye of another, the
swelling of a small gland, the deposit of a
small grain of sand, what agonies may these
slight causes inflict! That fine filament of
nerves of feeling spread like a wonderful network
of gossamer over the whole surface of
the body, how exquisitely susceptible is it!
A trifling burn, or scald, or incision, how
does it cause the member affected to be drawn
back suddenly, and the patient to cry out!
Now there can be no question that if man were
in a perfectly moral state, moral evil would
affect his mind as sensibly and in as lively a
manner&mdash;would, in short, be as much of an
affliction to him, as pain is to his physical
frame. He would shrink and snatch himself
away, as sin came near to his consciousness, the
first entrance of it into his imagination would
wound and arouse his moral sensibilities, and
make him positively unhappy.&mdash;<i>Goulburn.</i></p></div>

<div class="footnote" id="o25_fn4"><p><a href="#o25_fna4"><span class="label">[4]</span></a>
The worst sin is not some outburst of
gross transgression, forming an exception to
the ordinary tenor of life, bad and dismal
as such a sin is; but the worst and most fatal
are the small continuous vices which root
underground and honeycomb the soul. Many
a man who thinks himself a Christian is in
more danger from the daily commission, for
example, of small pieces of sharp practice in
his business, than ever was David at his worst.
White ants pick a carcase clean sooner than a
lion will.&mdash;<i>Maclaren.</i></p></div>

As an eagle, though she enjoy her wings
and beak, is wholly prisoner if she be held but

1573&ndash;1631.</p>

<p>Ships, when the tide rises and sets strongly in
any direction, sometimes turn and seem as if
they would go out upon it. But they only head
that way, and move from side to side, swaying
and swinging without moving on at all.
There seems to be nothing to hinder them from
sailing and floating out to sea; but there is
something. Down under the water a great
anchor lies buried in the mud. The ship cannot
escape. The anchor holds her. And thus
are men holden by the cords of their own sins.
They go about trying to discover some way to
be forgiven, but yet keep good friends with
the devil that is in them.&mdash;<i>Beecher.</i></p></div>

not to do well? &rsquo;Tis not thy fields being clear
of weeds, but fruitful in corn, pays the rent,
and brings thee in thy profit; nor thy not
being drunk, unclean, or any other sin, but
thy being holy, gracious, thy having faith

<h3 class="tdc" id="o26"><span class="smcap">The Great Task.</span></h3>

<p class="bq">i.&nbsp;17. <i>Learn to do well.</i></p>

<p>Negative goodness is not enough to
meet the Divine requirements. Those
who have &ldquo;ceased to do evil&rdquo; must
&ldquo;learn to do well.&rdquo; God demands
positive <span class="wsnw">excellence.<a id="o26_fna1" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#o26_fn1">[1]</a></span>
The cultivation
of well-doing is the surest guarantee
against evil-<span class="wsnw">doing.<a id="o26_fna2" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#o26_fn2">[2]</a></span></p>

<p><b>I. Well-doing is a thing to be learned.</b>
We have been too prone to look at it
in its other aspect only, as a thing
springing from faith and love, not as
a thing to be cultivated. But see
Phil. iv.&nbsp;9; 1&nbsp;Tim. v.&nbsp;4; Titus iii.&nbsp;14;
Matt. xi.&nbsp;29; Heb. v.&nbsp;3 All <i>experience</i>
is in accordance with the teaching of
these texts. Has any case occurred in
which at the beginning of the Christian
life a person was proficient in well-doing?
Men are not born into the
Christian life with a perfect capacity
to <i>do</i> well, any more than they are
born into the natural life with a perfect
capacity to <i>speak</i> well. Conversion is
a beginning, not an <span class="wsnw">ending.<a id="o26_fna3" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#o26_fn3">[3]</a></span>
We then begin to learn the standards,
methods, opportunities, and practice
of excellence. In the hour of conversion
we do but pass into Christ&rsquo;s school,
and begin to be His <i>disciples.</i> Well-doing
is not to be learned in one lesson,
nor in six lessons. [<i>Illustration:</i> frequent
advertisement, &ldquo;French in six
lessons.&rdquo; Absurd!] It was only after a
prolonged training and most varied discipline
that St. Paul could say, &ldquo;I have
<i>learned</i> in whatsoever state I am, therewith
to be content.&rdquo; Is <i>that</i> a lesson
to be acquired in a day? Let our own
hearts supply further proof. Look
within, and see the evils yet unsubdued,
the excellences yet unattained, the
difficulty with which many a duty is
discharged, and you will see the necessity
of <i>learning</i> to do well. We have
<i>learned</i> to do well only when it has
become a <i>habit</i> to us, when we do it as
easily and naturally as a well-trained
merchant&rsquo;s clerk adds up a column of
figures correctly. But can any <i>habit</i>
be acquired without prolonged
<span class="wsnw">practice?<a id="o26_fna4" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#o26_fn4">[4]</a></span></p>

<p><b>II. Well-doing is learned much in
the same way as other things are
learned.</b> Learning a language involves
study, patience, perseverance, practice.
Not otherwise can we learn to do
<span class="wsnw">well.<a id="o26_fna5" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#o26_fn5">[5]</a></span></p>

<p><b>III. In learning to do well, we need
both inspiration and help.</b> We have
both; the <i>inspiration</i> in the example
of our Lord (Acts x.&nbsp;38; Heb. xii.&nbsp;2);
the <i>help</i> in the gracious assistance of
the Holy Ghost (Rom. viii.&nbsp;26). Therefore,
difficult as the task is, we may
address ourselves to it with good hope
of success.&mdash;<i>William Jones.</i></p>

All the religion of some men runs upon
<i>nots.</i> &ldquo;I am not as this publican.&rdquo; That
ground is nought, though it brings not forth
briars and thorns, if it yieldeth not good increase.
Not only the unruly servant (Matt.
xxiv.&nbsp;48, 49) is cast into hell, but also the <i>idle</i>
servant (Matt. xxv.&nbsp;30). Meroz is cursed
not for opposing and fighting, but for not
helping. Dives did not take away food from
Lazarus, but he did not give him any of his
crumbs. &ldquo;I set up no other gods;&rdquo; ay, but
dost thou reverence and obey the true God?
&ldquo;I do not profane the Sabbath.&rdquo; Dost thou
sanctify it? Thou dost not wrong thy parents;
but dost thou reverence them? Thou dost not
murder; but dost thou do good to thy neighbour?
Usually men cut off half of their bill,
as the unjust steward bade the man who owed
a hundred set down fifty. We do not think of
sins of omission. If we are no drunkards,
adulterers, and profane persons, we do not think
what it is to omit respects to God, not to reverence
His holy majesty, not to delight in Him
and His ways.&mdash;<i>Monton,</i> 1620&ndash;1667.</p></div>

Fighting faults is the most discouraging
<span class="pagenum" id="p42">[p.&nbsp;42]</span>
thing in the world. When corn reaches a certain
height, no more weeds can grow among it.
The corn overshadows and grows them down.
Let men fill themselves full of good things.
Let them make their love and purity and kindness
grow up like corn, that every evil and noxious
thing within them may be overshadowed
and die.&mdash;<i>Beecher.</i></p></div>

<div class="footnote" id="o26_fn3"><p><a href="#o26_fna3"><span class="label">[3]</span></a>
No man is born into the full Christian
character, any more than he is born into the
character of a man when he comes into the
world. A man at conversion is in the state of
one who has just come in to the possession of an
old homestead. He had the title, and he can
make for himself a beautiful home. But the
dust, the dirt, and the cobwebs of years choke
all the rooms, and must be cleared away. Many
sills and beams are rotten, and must be replaced
by new ones. Chambers must be refitted, walls
newly plastered, the whole roof must be searched
over, and every leak stopped. There must be
a thorough cleansing and repair before the mansion
is habitable; and when all this is done, it
is only <i>an empty house</i> that the man has. The
same kind of thing that man has <i>who has
trained himself into freedom from wrong, without
having become faithful in right deeds.</i>&mdash;<i>Beecher.</i></p></div>

<div class="footnote" id="o26_fn4"><p><a href="#o26_fna4"><span class="label">[4]</span></a>
Character is consolidated habit, and
habit forms itself by repeated action. Habits
are like paths beaten hard and clear by the multitude
of light footsteps which go to and fro.
The daily restraint or indulgence of the nature,
in the business, in the hope, in the imagination,
which is the inner laboratory of the life,
creates the character which, whether it be
here or there, settles the destiny.&mdash;<i>J.&nbsp;Baldwin
Brown.</i></p></div>

<div class="footnote" id="o26_fn5"><p><a href="#o26_fna5"><span class="label">[5]</span></a>
It is not great, or special, or extraordinary
experiences which constitute in the best
sense the <i>religious</i> character. It is the uniform
daily walk with God, serving Him in little
things as well as great&mdash;in the ordinary duties
and everyday avocations, as well as in the
midst of grave and eventful contingencies. As
the sublimest symphony is made up of separate
single notes;&mdash;as the wealth of the cornfield is
made up of separate stalks, or rather of separate
grains;&mdash;as the magnificent texture, with
its gorgeous combinations of colour, is made
up of individual threads;&mdash;as the mightiest
avalanche that ever came thundering down
from its Alpine throne, uprooting villages and
forests, is made up of tiny snowflakes;&mdash;so it
is with the spiritual life. That life is itself
the grandest illustration of the power of littles.
Character is the product of daily, hourly actions,
words, thoughts; daily forgivenesses, unselfishnesses,
kindnesses, sympathies, charities, sacrifices
for the good of others, struggles against
temptations, submissiveness under trial. Oh
it is these, like the blending colours in a picture,
or the blending notes of music, which constitute
the man.&mdash;<i>Macduff.</i></p></div>

<h3 class="tdc" id="o27"><span class="smcap">The Noblest Art.</span></h3>

<p class="bq">i.&nbsp;17. <i>Learn to do well.</i></p>

<p><b>I. To do well is a thing that requires
to be learned.</b> 1.&nbsp;<i>It does not come to us
naturally,</i> as breathing and sleeping do.
That which comes to us naturally is to
do evil. This is manifest in every child:
it needs no teaching to do evil, but it
needs a great deal of teaching before it
will habitually do well. Nor does proficiency
in well-doing come to us even
with our new birth. Then come new
desires after righteousness, but the
knowledge and practice of righteousness
have to be <span class="wsnw">learned.<a id="o27_fna1" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#o27_fn1">[1]</a></span> At our new
birth we are <i>born</i> &ldquo;babes in Christ:&rdquo;
manhood in Christ is reached only by
<span class="wsnw"><i>growth.</i><a id="o27_fna2" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#o27_fn2">[2]</a></span>
2.&nbsp;<i>It is not a thing we acquire
unconsciously,</i> as infants learn to see and
hear, or as older persons acquire the
accent of the country in which they
reside, or as invalids gain health at the
seaside. Living in a religious atmosphere
will not of itself make us religious,
nor will mere companionship with good
men. Association with artists will not
of itself make a man an artist; and
association with Christians will not of
itself make any man a Christian. Judas
was in constant association with Christ
himself for more than three years, and
at the end of that period, instead of
doing well, he committed he foulest of
all crimes. To do well is an <i>art,</i> and,
like every other art, it can be mastered
only by deliberate efforts of the
<span class="wsnw">will.<a id="o27_fna3" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#o27_fn3">[3]</a></span>
This is the testimony both of <i>Scripture</i>
and <i>experience.</i> (See <a href="#o26">preceding outline.</a>)</p>

<p><b>II. To do well is a thing that may
be learned.</b> Not all persons, however
earnest their desires or persevering their
efforts, can become poets, painters,
statesman, orators. But to do well is
an art in which all regenerate persons
may become proficient, some with
greater ease than others, but to none
is the task impossible. There is no
vice which a regenerate man may not
<span class="pagenum" id="p43">[p.&nbsp;43]</span>
lay aside, no excellence to which he
may not attain.</p>

<p><b>III. To do well is a thing that must
be learned.</b> It is an imperative demand
which God makes upon all His people.
We cannot satisfy it by &ldquo;ceasing to
do evil.&rdquo; It is not enough for the
&ldquo;branches&rdquo; of the True Vine not to
bring forth &ldquo;wild grapes;&rdquo; they must
bear <i>fruit</i>&mdash;<i>much</i> fruit&mdash;to the glory of
the Husbandman (John xv.&nbsp;8). Not
only must Christ&rsquo;s followers be &ldquo;blameless,&rdquo;
they must be <i>conspicuous</i> for excellence.
&ldquo;Let your <i>light</i> so <span class="smcap">shine</span> before
men that they may <i>see</i> your good works,
and glorify your Father which is in
heaven.&rdquo; These truths being settled in
our minds, let us ask ourselves.</p>

<p><b>IV. How this noblest of arts may be
acquired.</b> 1.&nbsp;<i>By setting before ourselves,
and carefully studying, the noblest models.</i>
Thus do those who would become proficient
in other arts: music, painting,
sculpture, architecture, &amp;c. Now the
great Master in the art of well-doing
was our Lord Jesus Christ: we must
therefore study Him and His works.
But as it is often a help to the discovery
of the secrets of a great master&rsquo;s excellences
to study the works of his disciples,
as thus our attention is sometimes
directed to points we might
otherwise overlook, and as by the contrast
between him and them, even when
they have done their best, we get a
clearer view of his transcendent power&mdash;so
it will be helpful to us to study
the character of Christ&rsquo;s noblest
<span class="wsnw">disciples,<a id="o27_fna4" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#o27_fn4">[4]</a></span>&mdash;always,
however, coming
back to the study of <i>His</i> character,
remembering that we shall succeed in
doing well only in proportion as we
become like <i>Him.</i> 2.&nbsp;<i>By becoming imbued
with the principles by which the great
masters in this art were animated.</i> Mere
mechanical imitation is always a poor
thing, and often a grotesque and pitiable
thing; because circumstances are continually
varying. What kind of an
English home would the most exact
reproduction of the most beautiful of
all classic villas be? The architect who
forgot that the climate of England is
not like that of Rome or Athens would be
accounted a fool. Yet many professed
imitators of Christ have fallen into a
similar mistake; they have imitated
merely the outward circumstances of
His life, and have forgotten that the
essential thing it to have &ldquo;the <i>mind</i>
that was in Christ.&rdquo; When we have
<i>that,</i> all else will follow as a matter of
course. Now the great principle which
governed Christ and His noblest disciples
was love&mdash;love to God and man:
a <i>docile</i> love, which did not seek to
please God in <i>its</i> way, but in <i>His</i> way,
and evermore searched the Scriptures
to discover upon what things God looks
with delight. 3.&nbsp;<i>By patient and persevering
endeavours to embody in our practice
the truths we have thus discovered.</i> Only
by such endeavours can the mastery in
any art be won. 4.&nbsp;<i>By fidelity in little
things.</i> The master&rsquo;s ease is reached
only by the student&rsquo;s painstaking&mdash;by
his careful endeavour to be <i>right</i> in each
individual note, line, shade, stroke,
word. It is <i>thus,</i> and thus only, that
the <i>habit</i> of doing well is gained.</p>

<p><b>V. Let us remember certain things
for our own encouragement.</b> 1.&nbsp;<i>We are
not left to learn this art alone:</i> we have
the constant help of the most reasonable,
patient, and successful of all
teachers. We are disciples of <i>Christ.</i>
How much that means! He does not
expect us to become proficients in a few
lessons. He remembers that the most
advanced of us are only little children
in His great school. If He sees in us
the earnest <i>desire</i> and the resolute <i>endeavour</i>
to learn, He is well <span class="wsnw">satisfied.<a id="o27_fna5" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#o27_fn5">[5]</a></span>
He will most carefully adapt His
methods of instruction to our individual
capacity. He will lead us on to the
goal step by step. Already in countless
thousands of instances He has dealt
successfully with most intractable
materials: scholars who seemed hopelessly
dull and inapt He has so instructed
that they have passed the
great examination that awaits us all at
death; and they are now carrying on
their studies in the great university of
heaven. 2.&nbsp;<i>In no other art does progress
bring so much happiness:</i> the testimony
of a good conscience; consciousness of
the approval of God; a pleasant retrospect,
brightening hopes. 3.&nbsp;<i>In no</i>
<span class="pagenum" id="p44">[p.&nbsp;44]</span>
<i>other art does proficiency ensure such rich
rewards.</i> Proficiency in any other art
can but win for us the honours and
joys of earth; proficiency in this will
secure for us the honours and joys of
heaven. It is one great doctrine of
Scripture, that we are <i>saved</i> through
our faith: it is another, that we are
<i>rewarded</i> according to our works.</p>

that which a portrait goes through under the
hand of the artist. When a man is converted,
he is but the outline sketch of a character which
he is to fill up. He first lays in the dead colouring.
Then come the work of laying in the
colours, and he goes on, day after day, week
after week, month after month, year after
year, blending them, and heightening the
effect. It is a life&rsquo;s work; and when he dies
he is still laying in and blending the colours,
and heightening the effect. And if men suppose
the work is done when they are converted,
why should we expect anything but lopsided
Christian character?&mdash;<i>Beecher.</i></p>

<p>Who starts up a finished Christian? The
very best men come from their graves, like
Lazarus, &ldquo;bound with grave-clothes,&rdquo;&mdash;not
like Jesus, who left the death-dress behind
Him; and, alas! in their remaining corruptions
all carry some of these cerements about
with them, nor drop them but at the gate of
heaven.&mdash;<i>Guthrie.</i></p></div>

God deals in spiritual proceedings, as in
natural, to extremes by the mean. We are
not born old men; but first an infant, then a
man, then old. We are conceived of immortal
seed, born of the Spirit, so go on to perfection.
There is first a seed, then a plant, then a tree.
We go not at one jump into heaven, nor at
one stroke kill the enemy.&mdash;<i>Adams,</i> 1643.</p></div>

Cast a sponge into water, and, the fluid
filling its empty cells, it swells out before our
eyes, increases more and more. There is no
effort here, and could be none; for though once
a living animal, the sponge is now dead and
dry. But it is not as sponges fill with water,
nor to use a Scripture figure often employed,
and sometimes misapplied, as Gideon&rsquo;s fleece
was filled with dews, that God&rsquo;s people are replenished
with His grace. More is needed than
simply to bring ourselves in contact with ordinances,
to read the Bible, to repair on Sabbath
to Church, to sit down in communion seasons
at the Lord&rsquo;s table.&mdash;<i>Guthrie.</i></p></div>

God hath provided and recommended to
us one example as a perfect standard of good
practice&mdash;the example of our Lord. That
indeed is the most universal, absolute, and
assured pattern; yet doth it not supersede the
use of other examples. Not only the valour
and conduct of the general, but those of inferior
officers, yea the resolution of common soldiers,
doth serve to animate their fellows. The stars
have their season to guide us as well as the
sun; especially when our eyes are so weak as
hardly to bear the day. Even considering our
infirmity, inferior examples by their imperfection
sometimes have a peculiar advantage.
Our Lord&rsquo;s most imitable practice did proceed
from an immense virtue of Divine grace which
we cannot arrive to; it is in itself so perfect
and high, that we may not ever reach it: looking
upon it may therefore sometimes dazzle
and discourage our weakness. But other good
men had assistance in measure such as we may
hope to approach unto; they were subject to
the difficulties which we feel; they were exposed
to the perils of falling which we fear;
we may therefore hope to march on in a reasonable
distance after them; we may, by help of
the same grace, come near in transcribing their
less exact copy.&mdash;<i>Barrow,</i> 1630&ndash;1677.</p></div>

Gotthold observed a boy in a writing-school
eyeing attentively the line placed before
him, and labouring to write with equal correctness
and beauty. Mark, said he to the bystanders,
how all perfection is the offspring of
imperfection, and how by frequent mistakes
we learn to do well. It is not required of this
boy that his penmanship shall equal that of
the line. He satisfies his master by the pains
he takes; for these are a ground of hope that
he will progressively improve, and at last learn
to write with rapidity and elegance. We also
have a pattern to copy. It has been left us by
the Lord Jesus Christ, and is His most perfect
and holy life. And think not that He extracts
more from us than the teacher does from the
pupil. No, indeed; if He find us carefully
studying His example, and diligent in our endeavours
to imitate it, He exercises forbearance
towards our faults, and by His grace and Spirit
daily strengthens us to amend.&mdash;<i>Scriver,</i> 1629&ndash;1693.</p></div>

<p class="bq">i.&nbsp;17. <i>Relieve the oppressed.</i></p>

<p>Religion means sympathy with man
in his oppressed condition. The truth
alone can give men freedom. <b>I.&nbsp;The
oppressed.</b> 1.&nbsp;<i>There are those oppressed
by sinful habits.</i> Many men are their
own tyrants. They build their own
prison, make their own fetters, and
whip themselves. Their oppression is
the consequence of their sin. Such are
to be relieved, however little they may
appear to desire or deserve it, by the
compassion of the good. 2.&nbsp;<i>There are
those oppressed by commercial difficulty.</i>
There are many men whose commercial
<span class="pagenum" id="p45">[p.&nbsp;45]</span>
life is one continual struggle to get
on, and to provide those things honest in
the sight of the world. They have
small capital. Fortune seems against
them. They are active, but they do
not succeed. Such ought to be relieved
by the generous consideration
of the good. 3.&nbsp;<i>There are those oppressed
by domestic misfortune.</i> The
wife has lost her husband. The children
have buried their parents. They
are out alone in the wide world. They
are liable to the thoughtless but stern
oppression of men. Such must be relieved
by the good. 4.&nbsp;<i>There are those
oppressed by religious bigotry.</i> There
are many great souls who are larger
than a sect, oppressed by the conventionally
orthodox. They are driven
from their pulpits. They are excommunicated
from their synagogue. They
need the relief of true sympathy. <b>II.&nbsp;Their
relief.</b> 1.&nbsp;<i>By personal</i>
<span class="wsnw"><i>sympathy.</i><a id="o28_fna1" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#o28_fn1">[1]</a></span>
Genuine sympathy is always a relief to
an oppressed<span class="wsnw">soul.<a id="o28_fna2" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#o28_fn2">[2]</a></span>
It heals the soul and lightens the
<span class="wsnw">burden.<a id="o28_fna3" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#o28_fn3">[3]</a></span>
A kind word, a cheering look, is welcome
to the oppressed. 2.&nbsp;<i>By intelligent advocacy.</i>
The cause of the oppressed should
be advocated where it is likely to be
redressed. Politics can be employed
in no higher ministry than in seeking
the relief of the oppressed. 3.&nbsp;<i>By
practical help.</i> Sympathy must not be
substituted for personal and self-denying
help. Words are well; smiles are
welcome; but personal help is the
most effective to the removal of oppression.&mdash;<i>J.&nbsp;S. Exell.</i></p>

We are all sons of one Father, members
of one body, and heirs of one kingdom, in respect
of which near-linking together there
should be compassion and sympathy betwixt
us. If one member do but grieve, all suffer
with it. When a thorn is got into the foot,
how is it that the back bows, the eyes pry into
the hurt, and the hands are busied to pluck
out the cause of the anguish? And we, being
members of one another, should bear with and
forbear one the other, the not doing whereof
will stick as a brand upon our souls that we
are of the number of them that have forsaken
the fear of the Almighty.&mdash;<i>Spencer,</i> 1658.</p></div>

Certain it is, that nothing can better
do it, so there is nothing greater, for which
God made our tongues, next to reciting His
praises, than to minister comfort to a weary
soul. And what greater pleasure can we have
than that we should bring joy to our brother,
who, with his dreary eyes, looks to heaven and
round about, and cannot find so much rest as
to lay his eyelids close together, than that thy
tongue should be tuned with heavenly accents,
and make the weary soul to listen for light
and ease; and when he perceives that there is
such a thing in the world, and in the order of
things as comfort and joy, to begin to break
out from the prison of his sorrows, at the door
of sighs and tears, and, by little and little, melts
into showers and refreshment? This is glory
to thy voice and employment fit for the brightest
angel. But so have I seen the sun kiss the
frozen earth, which was bound up with images
of death, and the colder breath of the north;
and then the waters break from their enclosures,
and melt with joy, and run in useful channels;
and the flies do rise again from their little
graves in the walls, and dance awhile in the
air, to tell that there is joy within, and that
the great mother of creatures will open the
stock of her new refreshment, become useful
to mankind, and sing praises to her Redeemer:
so is the heart of a sorrowful man under the
discourses of a wise comforter; he breaks from
the despairs of the grave, and the fetters and
chains of sorrow; he blesses God, and he blesses
thee, and he feels his life returning: for to be
miserable is death, but nothing is life but to
be comforted: and God is pleased with no
music from below so much as in the thanksgiving
songs of relieved widows, of supported
orphans, of rejoicing and comforted and thankful
persons.&mdash;<i>Jeremy Taylor,</i> 1612&ndash;1667.</p></div>

Till we have reflected on it, we are
scarcely aware how much the sum of human
happiness in the world is indebted to this one
feeling&mdash;sympathy. We get cheerfulness, and
vigour, we scarcely know how or when, from
mere association with our fellow-men; and
from the looks reflected on us of gladness and
enjoyment we catch inspiration and power
to go on, from human presence and from
cheerful looks. The workman works with
added energy from having others by. The full
family circle has a strength and a life peculiarly
its own. The substantial good and the effectual
relief which men extend to one another is
trifling. It is not by these, but by something
far less costly, that the work is done. God
has ensured it by a much more simple machinery.
He has given to the weakest and the
poorest power to contribute largely to the
common stock of gladness. The child&rsquo;s smile
and laugh are mighty powers in this world.
When bereavement has left you desolate, what
substantial benefit is there which makes condolence
acceptable? It cannot replace the
loved ones you have lost. It can bestow upon
you nothing permanent. But a warm hand
has touched yours, and its thrill told you that
there was a living response there to your emotion.
One look, one human sigh, has done
more for you than the costliest present could
convey.&mdash;<i>Robertson,</i> 1816&ndash;1853.</p></div>

<h3 class="tdc" id="o29"><span class="smcap">God&rsquo;s Ideal of Goodness.</span></h3>

<p class="bq">i.&nbsp;17. <i>Learn to do well; seek judgment, relieve the oppressed, judge the fatherless,
plead for the widow.</i></p>

<p>This verse is more correctly translated
thus&mdash;<i>&ldquo;Learn to do well; seek
judgment, restrain the oppressor, right
the fatherless, maintain the cause of the
widow.&rdquo;</i>&mdash;or, <i>&ldquo;Learn to do good; seek
out judgment, redress wrong, judge the
fatherless, befriend the widow.&rdquo;</i></p>

<p>The form of these admonitions was
determined by the sins of which the
rulers of Jerusalem had been guilty.
By them the course of justice had been
perverted (ver. 23; Micah iii.&nbsp;11, &amp;c.);
wrongs had been left unredressed, and
oppressors unrestrained; the orphans
and the widows, having neither money
to bribe nor power to overawe the
corrupt judges, had sought in vain for
justice,&mdash;such judges as our Lord has
depicted in His parable (Luke xviii.&nbsp;2)
were common. The four specific admonitions
of this verse are a divinely-inspired
exposition of the general admonition
with which it commences.
So regarded, we find it in <i>God&rsquo;s ideal of
goodness.</i> The command is given, &ldquo;Learn
to do well.&rdquo; Yes, but what is meant
by learning to do well? &ldquo;To do well,&rdquo;
says the prophet, is &ldquo;to seek out judgment,
to restrain the oppressor, to judge
the fatherless, to befriend the widow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This Divine ideal of goodness is in
startling opposition to certain standards
of excellence widely accepted
both in the Church and in the world.
It is in opposition (1)&nbsp;to the idea that
<i>a good man is one who does no harm.</i>
How prevalent is the notion that a
man who refrains from injuring his
neighbours is a person worthy of high
commendation! But to do no harm
merely is to fall far short of the Scripture
standard of <span class="wsnw">excellence.<a id="o29_fna1" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#o29_fn1">[1]</a></span>
It is in opposition (2)&nbsp;to the idea that <i>a
man who confines himself to the cultivation
of personal virtues is a true follower of
Christ.</i> In all our Churches there are
multitudes of persons whose &ldquo;religion&rdquo;
is a purely selfish consideration. They
have been taught that certain excellences
are necessary to qualify them
for admission to heaven, and to the
cultivation of these excellences they
address themselves assiduously, merely
that they may secure their own eternal
well-being. But such persons fail to
observe that the mind that was in
Christ was not a spirit of self-seeking
but of self-sacrifice. It is in opposition
(3)&nbsp;to the idea that <i>the more spiritual a
man is, the more indifferent he will be to
what happens in the world.</i> It is precisely
to concern as to what happens
in the world that we are here called.
We are to &ldquo;seek out justice,&rdquo; to use
all our influence that justice and righteousness
shall prevail in the community
in which we dwell. We are not simply
to mourn over wrongs; we are to redress
them, and we are to restrain the oppressors.
Especially are we to see to it
that justice is done to the orphans,
and to all helpless ones such as they.
The widow we are to befriend; she is
to be our &ldquo;client,&rdquo; and we are to see
to it that she is not wronged because
God has been pleased to remove her
natural defender. To live thus for
others, to be the friend of the friendless,
the defender of the weak, the
resolute opposer of all oppressors,&mdash;this
and this only, is to realise the
Divine ideal of <span class="wsnw">goodness.<a id="o29_fna2" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#o29_fn2">[2]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Application.</span>&mdash;1. <i>Men are good precisely
in proportion as they are like</i>
<span class="wsnw"><i>God.</i><a id="o29_fna3" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#o29_fn3">[3]</a></span>
Between a merely &ldquo;harmless&rdquo; man and
God there is no resemblance. Between
a man who lives only to secure his own
well-being and God there is a positive
contrast. Between a man who is indifferent
to the sorrows and the wrongs
of his fellow-men there is still greater
contrast. He is not indifferent to what
takes place on earth. It is His supreme
glory that He burns with indignation
against oppression, and that He is the
friend especially of the friendless and
the weak (Ps. cxlvi.&nbsp;7&ndash;9; cxlvii.&nbsp;2&ndash;6).
It is to resemblance to Him in these
things, and not merely in abstinence
from evil, that we are called (James i.&nbsp;27).
<span class="pagenum" id="p47">[p.&nbsp;47]</span>
2.&nbsp;<i>A selfish life is a godless life.</i>
Men may be eminently respectable
members of society, and highly
esteemed members of churches, and
yet be utterly unlike God. Men who
live only for themselves, or to promote
the happiness merely of their own
households, and selfishly decline to
take any part in philanthropic labours,
or in social and political movements
which have for their object the removal
of public wrongs, are utterly out of
sympathy with Him upon whose approval
they reckon so confidently and
so mistakenly. Had they any true
love for God, they would have an
unselfish love for men, and would be
quick to feel and to resent the wrongs
that are done them (1&nbsp;John iii.&nbsp;14,
&amp;c.) Dives was probably a highly
respectable citizen of Jerusalem, and
on good terms with the authorities of
the temple, but the selfishness of his
life sufficed at the last to exclude him
from the Divine
<span class="wsnw">presence.<a id="o29_fna4" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#o29_fn4">[4]</a></span>
3.&nbsp;<i>A godlike life can never be a life of ease.</i>
How many members of our churches
have incurred Christ&rsquo;s woe! (Luke
vi.&nbsp;26). Prudent men, they have been
careful never to &ldquo;meddle&rdquo; in affairs
of their neighbours; they have never
identified themselves with any revolutionary
movements; against wrongs
which have not troubled themselves
they have never uttered words of
flaming indignation! And yet they
imagine themselves to be followers of
Him who spoke of &ldquo;the cross&rdquo; which
each of His disciples would have to
carry. What He meant by this saying
is a mystery to them. But let them begin
to endeavour to &ldquo;learn to do well&rdquo;
and this saying of His will be a mystery
to them no longer. The world will
very soon hate them even as it hated
Him. But this is one of the surest
signs that we are His (John xv.&nbsp;18, 19).</p>

He is not half a saint who is but a negative
saint. The forbearance of gross corruptions
is the easiest and least part of religion, and therefore
will not speak any man in a state of salvation.
The tree that is barren and without good
fruit is for the fire, as well as the tree that brings
forth evil fruit.</p>

<p>For men to think to excuse themselves that
they do no hurt, wrong neither man, woman,
or child, and are not, as the Pharisee said,
as the publicans, who generally were oppressors,
it but a vain, foolish thing. The idle servant
might have said, &ldquo;Lord, I did no harm with
my talent; I did not lay it out in rioting and
drunkenness, or any way to Thy dishonour; I
only hid it, and did not improve it,&rdquo;&mdash;yet this
was enough to condemn him. Can we call
ground good ground for bearing no weeds, if
it never bring forth good corn? Or do we
count that servant a good servant who doth
not wrong his master in the estate by purloining
or wasting it, if he live idle all day, and
neglect the business his master appoints him?&mdash;<i>Swinnock,</i> 1673.</p></div>

A religion that does not take hold of the
life that now is, is like a cloud that does not
rain. A cloud may roll in grandeur, and be
an object of admiration, but if it does not rain,
it is of little account so far as utility is concerned.
And a religion that consists in the
observance of magnificent ceremonies, but that
does not touch the duties of daily life, is a religion
of show and of sham.&mdash;<i>Beecher.</i></p></div>

To be godly is to be godlike. The full
accord of all the soul with His character, in
whom, as their native home, dwell &ldquo;whatsoever
things are pure, whatsoever things are lovely,&rdquo;
and the full conformity of the will to His sovereign
will, who is the life of our lives&mdash;this,
and nothing shallower, nothing narrower, is
religion in its perfection, and the measure in
which we have attained to this harmony with
God is the measure in which we are Christians.
As two stringed instruments may be so tuned
to one keynote that if you strike the one, a
faint ethereal echo is heard from the other,
which blends undistinguishably with its parent
sound; so drawing near to God, and brought
into unison with His mind and will, our responsive
spirits vibrate in accord with His, and
give forth tones, low and thin indeed, but still
repeating the mighty music of heaven.&mdash;<i>Maclaren.</i></p></div>

They are selfish&mdash;because they have no

be caught upon its net, and appropriated to its
use. So they who live without God reticulate
life with selfishness. Nothing concerns them
except as it may be drawn into the mesh of
scheming for ministering to their own wants
and wishes.&mdash;<i>Bellew.</i></p></div>

<p>It is scarcely possible to conceive of
a more interesting and delightful exhibition
of the love and mercy of God
than is presented to us in these words;
unless they had been found in the
volume of eternal truth, we might have
justly doubted their veracity. For the
speaker is Jehovah, a Being infinitely
happy and glorious in Himself. He
needs not, on His own account, the
return of the sinner to Himself. Besides,
He is the offended party. How
marvellous, then, that He should stoop
to ask reconciliation with poor wretched
man, the rebel and traitor against

excellency, but in the vilest and most

are as scarlet and crimson. This description
includes&mdash;1.&nbsp;<i>Those whose sins
are glaring and manifest.</i> In the heart
of men there is much evil that man or
angel never sees. External circumstances
act in the moral world as the
shore to the ocean, limiting and bounding
its waters. The control thus exerted
upon men is well for them, for
society, and for the Church. But
numbers cast it off, sin in open day, and
glory in their shame. Their sins are
as scarlet or as crimson. 2.&nbsp;<i>Those whose
iniquities are specially productive of much
evil and misery</i>&mdash;ringleaders in sin;
ridiculers of piety, who labour to
throng the road to hell; ungodly
masters; ungodly heads of households,

great privileges and mercies</i> (Matt. xi.&nbsp;20&ndash;24).

The Jews of old declared that they were
not free agents, and that they could
not help committing the sins of which
they were guilty (Jer. vii.&nbsp;10). This
is the grossest self-deception. It cannot
be the will of God that you should
do evil (1&nbsp;Thess. iv.&nbsp;3; James i.&nbsp;13;
1&nbsp;Pet. i.&nbsp;16). To attribute our sins to
Him is the most outrageous impiety.
You have sinned freely; it has been
your own act and choice. 3.&nbsp;<i>You must
plead guilty.</i> Cast yourself on the
mercy of God, pleading guilty, you
shall not be condemned, if&mdash;4.&nbsp;<i>You
plead the merits of Christ.</i> He is &ldquo;the
propitiation for our sin.&rdquo; Here is your
hope, your plea. In availing yourself
of this plea, all that God requires is
repentance and faith. <b>III.&nbsp;The gracious

<p class="bq">i.&nbsp;18. <i>Though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they
be red like crimson, they shall be as wool.</i></p>

<p>We are informed by the Rabbins
that the high priest bound a scarlet
fillet round the neck of the scapegoat,
and that when the priest confessed his
own sins and the sins of the people,
the fillet became white if the atonement
was accepted by God, but that
if it was not accepted, the fillet remained
scarlet still. The Rabbins
further say that the goat was led
about twelve furlongs out of Jerusalem
where it was thrown down a
precipice, and was mangled to atoms
by the fall. In case of the sacrifice being
received by Heaven, a scarlet ribbon
which hung at the door of the temple
changed from scarlet to pure white.
They affirm that it is to this changing
of the fillet and ribbon from scarlet
to white that Isaiah refers in our text.
While we regard these as fictions, and
not as facts, they serve to illustrate
the nature and greatness of the change
spoken of in it. <b>I.&nbsp;Scarlet and crimson
represent sins of excessive and glaring
notoriety.</b> 1.&nbsp;The soul has been
steeped in the dyeing element. 2.&nbsp;It
has carried away as much of the dyeing
quality as it can hold. It is twice dipped
in the dye-vat. 3.&nbsp;The sins glare and
arrest the eye like scarlet in the sun.
As the uniform of the British soldier
is most conspicuous, so these sins glare
in the eye (1)&nbsp;of society, (2)&nbsp;of conscience,
(3)&nbsp;of Divine justice. <b>II.
Scarlet and crimson symbolise the
fast and permanent hold of these sins
upon the soul.</b> 1.&nbsp;The sins are not a
<i>stain</i> but a <i>dye.</i> 2.&nbsp;The sins are not
superficial: they have penetrated into
the fabric, every thread of which has
been dyed. The faculties are the
threads: the whole man the web. 3.&nbsp;The
sins are not typified by <i>any</i> dye,
but by <i>scarlet</i> and <i>crimson,</i> which are
as permanent as the fabric they colour.
They resist sun, dew, rain, the wash.
<b>III.&nbsp;Scarlet and crimson becoming
white as snow represents the perfect
removal of the greatest sins.</b> The
colouring element is removed. The
soul is <i>restored.</i> The power that removes
the sin yet saves the soul.
<i>Application.</i>&mdash;There is hope, then, even
for the vilest. The most desperately
sinful need not
<span class="wsnw">despair.<a id="o31_fna1" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#o31_fn1">[1]</a></span>&mdash;<i>J.&nbsp;Stirling.</i></p>

In nature there is hardly a stone that is
not capable of crystallising into something
purer and brighter than its normal state.
Coal, by a slightly different arrangement of its
particles, is capable of becoming the radiant
diamond. The slag cast out from the furnace
as useless waste forms into globular masses
of radiating crystals. From tar and pitch the
loveliest colours are now manufactured. The
very mud of the road, trampled under foot as
the type of all impurity, can be changed by
chemical art into metals and gems of surpassing
beauty; and so the most unpromising
materials, the most worthless moral rubbish
that man cast out and despise, may be converted
by the Divine alchemy into the gold of
the sanctuary, and made jewels fit for the
mediatorial crown of the Redeemer. Let the
case of Mary Magdalene, of John Newton, of
John Bunyan, of thousands more, encourage
those who are still in the gall of bitterness and
in the bond of iniquity. Seek to be subjected
to the same purifying process; lay yourselves
open to the same spiritual influences; yield
yourselves up into the hands of the Spirit to
become His finished and exquisite workmanship;
seek diligently a saving and sanctifying
union with Christ by faith, and He will
perfect that which concerneth you, and lay your
stones with fair colours (Ps. lxviii.&nbsp;13).&mdash;<i>Macmillan.</i></p></div>

<p>Some are kept in a desponding state&mdash;<b>I.&nbsp;By
the views they entertain of the
sovereignty of God and the doctrine
of election.</b> But&mdash;1.&nbsp;The election of
God, whatever it is, is an election <i>unto
life,</i> and not unto destruction. It
should therefore be a source of encouragement,
not discouragement; it
<span class="pagenum" id="p50">[p.&nbsp;50]</span>
should awaken hope and joy, rather
than despondency. 2.&nbsp;God&rsquo;s election

nothing to do with <span class="wsnw">election;<a id="o32_fna2" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#o32_fn2">[2]</a></span>
but if you will entertain the question,
the <i>evidence</i> is much more in favour of your
election than against it. <b>II.&nbsp;By the
views they take of certain isolated
passages of Scripture</b> (Matt. xii.&nbsp;31,
32; Heb. xii.&nbsp;17; Prov. i.&nbsp;24&ndash;31).
Not one of these passages, rightly
understood, need quench your hope.
Where there is one obscure passage
that seems to make against you, there
is a hundred which plainly and positively
tell you that if you turn you shall
live, if you believe you shall be saved.

repentance has not been deep enough.</b>

2.&nbsp;It is not the depth of your feelings that
is your warrant to come to Christ.

likely to be increased by staying away
from Christ. <b>IV.&nbsp;By the fear that
they have gone too far and sinned too
much to be forgiven.</b> But, admitting
the very worst you can say of yourself,
there is everything in the character of
God, in the work of Christ, in the

of other <span class="wsnw">sinners,<a id="o32_fna4" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#o32_fn4">[4]</a></span>

Whatever the decrees of God be concerning
the eternal state of men, since they are
secret to us, they can certainly be no rule either
of our duty or comfort. And no man hath
reason to think himself rejected of God who
does not find the marks of reprobation in himself&mdash;I
mean an evil heart and life. By this,
indeed, a man may know that he is out of God&rsquo;s
favour for the present; but he hath no reason
at all from hence to conclude that God hath
from all eternity and for ever cast him off.
That God calls him to repentance, and affords
him the space and means of it, is a much plainer
sign that God is willing to have mercy upon
him, than anything else can be that God hath
utterly cast him off. For men to judge of their
condition by the decrees of God, which are hid
from us, and not by His Word, which is near
us, is as if a man wandering in the wide sea in
a dark night, when the heaven is all clouded,
should resolve to steer his course by the stars
which he cannot see, but only guess at, and
neglect the compass which is at hand, and
would afford him much better and more certain
direction.&mdash;<i>Tillotson,</i> 1630&ndash;1694.</p></div>

We have no ground at first to trouble
ourselves about God&rsquo;s election. &ldquo;Secret things
belong to God.&rdquo; God&rsquo;s revealed will is, that
all who believe in Christ should not perish. It
is my duty, therefore, knowing this, to believe:
by doing whereof I put that question, whether
God be mine or no? out of all question, for all
that believe in Christ are Christ&rsquo;s, and all that
are Christ&rsquo;s are God&rsquo;s. It is not my duty to
look to God&rsquo;s secret counsel, but to His open
offer, invitation, and command, and thereupon
adventure my soul. In war men will venture
their lives, because they think some will escape,
and why not they? In traffic beyond the seas
many adventure a great estate, because some
grow rich by a good return, though some miscarry.
The husbandman adventures his seed,
though sometimes the year proves so bad that
he never sees it more. And shall not we make
a spiritual adventure, in casting ourselves upon
God, when we have so good a warrant as His
command, and so good an encouragement as
His promise, that He will not fail those that
rely on Him?&mdash;<i>Sibbes,</i> 1577&ndash;1635.</p></div>

I see no reason to call in question the
truth and sincerity of that man&rsquo;s repentance
who hates sin and forsakes, and returns to
God and his duty, though he cannot shed tears,
and express the bitterness of his soul by the
same significations that a mother does in the
loss of her only son. He that cannot weep like
a child may resolve like a man, and that undoubtedly
will find acceptance with God. Two
persons walking together espy a serpent; the
one shrieks and cries out at the sight of it, the
other kills it. So it is with sorrow for sin;
some express it by great lamentations and
tears, and vehement transports of passion;
others by greater and more real effects of detestation&mdash;by
forsaking their sins, by mortifying
and subduing their lusts; but he that kills it
doth certainly best express his inward enmity
against it.&mdash;<i>Tillotson,</i> 1630&ndash;1694.</p></div>

Oh who can read of a <i>Manasseh,</i> a <i>Magdalene,</i>
a <i>Saul,</i> yes, an <i>Adam,</i> who undid himself
and a whole world with him, in the roll of pardoned
sinners, and yet turn away from the promise,
out of a fear that there is not mercy fit in it
to serve his turn? These are landmarks that
show what large boundaries mercy hath set for
itself, and how far it hath gone, even to take
into its arms the greatest sinners that make
not themselves incapable thereof by final impenitency.
It were a healthful walk, poor
doubting Christian, for thy soul go to this circuit,
and oft see where the utmost stone is laid
and boundary set by God&rsquo;s pardoning mercy,
beyond which He will not go.&mdash;<i>Gurnall,</i> 1617&ndash;1679.</p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">I. The Wonders of Divine Condescension.</span>
1.&nbsp;How marvellous that
God should condescend to &ldquo;reason&rdquo;
with sinful men! Not thus do human
governments deal with rebels against
their authority. The stern proclamation
goes forth, &ldquo;Submit, or die.&rdquo; To
admit helpless rebels to a conference
on equal terms (such as &ldquo;reasoning&rdquo;
implies) is an idea that never occurs to
earthly sovereigns; but (ch. lv.&nbsp;8, 9)&mdash;2.&nbsp;How
marvellous that God should invite
sinful men to reason with Him, with
a view to reconciliation with them! The
result of such an investigation of their
conduct could only be their condemnation;
but this is not God&rsquo;s ultimate design.
He does not desire to humiliate
sinners, but to bring them to repentance
and confession, in order that it
may be possible for Him to pardon
them. According to human standards,
it would have been a great thing had
God been willing to be reconciled to
those who have offended Him so grievously;
but how astonishing is this,
that He, the offended party, should
seek to reconcile the offenders to Himself.
(2&nbsp;Cor. v.&nbsp;18, 19; John iii.&nbsp;19).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">II. The possibilities of Human
Sin.</span> &ldquo;Though your sins be as scarlet&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
though they be red like crimson.&rdquo;
Sins that take complete possession
of a man, and that are conspicuous
to the public eye, may be described as
crimson and scarlet sins. How common
such sins are! What a spectacle
the human race must present to angelic
eyes! Scarlet and crimson sins are
more common than we are apt to
suppose, because responsibility is in
proportion to privilege. In proportion
to the sinner&rsquo;s light is the sinner&rsquo;s
guilt. Consequently that which is a
trivial fault in one man may be a
crimson sin in another. When an
offence is contrary to a man&rsquo;s whole
training, though it may be a small
matter in the sight of man, it may be
as scarlet and crimson sin in the sight
of God. In these possibilities of
human sin we have&mdash;<b>1.&nbsp;A reason for
universal watchfulness.</b> Taken even
in its most obvious sense, the possibility
of which our text speaks is the
possibility of every man. There is no
human being who may not fall into
crime. Many men, after living half a
century blamelessly in the sight of
men, suddenly yield to temptation,
and are consigned to felons&rsquo; cells.
David was no stripling when he committed
his great transgression. Said
Hazael, &ldquo;Is thy servant a dog, that he
should do this thing?&rdquo; Yet he did it!
(2&nbsp;Kings viii.&nbsp;13, &amp;c.) Peter rejected
Christ&rsquo;s warning as incredible. Therefore
(Rom. xi.&nbsp;20; 1&nbsp;Cor. <span class="wsnw">x. 12).<a id="o33_fna2" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#o33_fn2">[2]</a></span>
<b>2.&nbsp;A reason for universal humiliation
and prayer.</b> Just because our privileges
have been so great, God may put
a very different estimate upon our
transgressions than we are disposed to
do. Therefore let us humbly seek
pardon for the past, and preventing
grace for the future (Ps. xix.&nbsp;12, 13).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">III. The certainties of Divine
Grace.</span> &ldquo;They shall be as white as
snow.&rdquo; Where sin abounds, grace shall
more abound. In God there is mercy
to pardon every <span class="wsnw">sin,<a id="o33_fna3" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#o33_fn3">[3]</a></span>
and grace to cleanse from every form and degree of
moral pollution. Here, then, we have&mdash;<b>1.&nbsp;A
reason for repentance.</b> There is
no argument so powerful as this: God
is ready to forgive. Many a prodigal
has been deterred from saying, &ldquo;I will
arise and go to my father,&rdquo; by a
remembrance of his father&rsquo;s sternness,
and by a doubt as to whether his
father would receive him. But no
such doubt need deter <i>us.</i> We are not
called to the exercises of a sorrow that
will be unavailing. Our Father waits
to be <span class="wsnw">gracious.<a id="o33_fna4" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#o33_fn4">[4]</a></span>
Hear His solemn and touching message (ch. lv.&nbsp;6, 7;
<span class="pagenum" id="p52">[p.&nbsp;52]</span>
<span class="smcap">text</span>). <b>2.&nbsp;An encouragement for those
who are striving after moral purity.</b>
Many who try to live a Christian life
grow discouraged. There are discouragements
that come from <i>without:</i>
the unfavourable spiritual atmosphere
in which they live, the glaring inconsistencies
of some of the professing
Christians by whom they are surrounded,
the low tone of the spiritual
life of those whose conduct is not so
open to censure. Still sorer discouragements
come from <i>within:</i> the faults
that will not be shaken off; the evil
tendencies that will manifest themselves;
the evil thoughts that will
keep welling up from the fountain of
the heart, revealing its intense depravity.
These things are carefully hidden
from men, but God knows them, and
the believer knows them, and because
of them is apt to grow discouraged.
It seems to him that he
can never be &ldquo;made meet for the inheritance
of the saints in light.&rdquo; But
God has declared that he shall be: God
has undertaken to perfect him in
purity. &ldquo;Be of good courage, all ye
that hope in the Lord.&rdquo; God is able
to make all grace abound toward you,
and He is faithful to all His promises.
See what He has promised in our text.
He has already fulfilled this promise
in innumerable cases (Rev. vii.&nbsp;9), and
He will fulfil it in yours. Be not discouraged
because your moral progress
is so slow. How long does the sun
shine on the fruit seemingly in vain!
All the summer the peach remains hard
as a stone. But the sun is <i>not</i> shining
in vain. Some week in the autumn
this is seen. All at once it softens
and becomes ripe; not as a result of
that one week&rsquo;s sun, but of all the
sunlight and warmth of the preceding
weeks. The chestnut opens in a night;
but for months the opening process is
going on. In a moment many chemicals
seem to crystallise, but the process
of crystallisation goes on long before it
becomes apparent. So there is a ripening,
a crystallising, a cleansing process
going on in the heart of the
believer: though we see it not now,
yet we shall have ample proof of it by
and by. In this matter walk by faith,
not by sight. Be of good courage!
We shall yet be &ldquo;white as snow.&rdquo;</p>

Jehovah here challenges Israel to a formal
trial: <span lang="hbo-Latn">nocach</span> is thus used in a reciprocal sense,
and with the same meaning as <span lang="hbo-Latn">nishpat</span> in ch.
xliii.&nbsp;26 (Ges. &sect; 51, 2). In such a trial Israel
must lose, for Israel&rsquo;s self-righteousness rests
upon sham righteousness; and this sham righteousness,
when rightly examined, is but unrighteousness
dripping with blood. It is taken
for granted that this must be the result of the
investigation. Israel is therefore worthy of
death. Yet Jehovah will not treat Israel according
to His retributive justice, but according
to His free compassion. He will remit the
punishment, and not only regard the sin as not
existing, but change it into its very opposite.
The reddest possible sin shall become, through
His mercy, the purest white. On the two
<span lang="hbo-Latn">hiphils</span> applied to colour, see Ges. &sect; 53, 2;
though he gives the meaning incorrectly, viz.,
&ldquo;to take a colour,&rdquo; whereas the words signify
rather to emit a colour, not <span lang="la">colorem accipere,</span>
but <span lang="la">colorem dare.</span> <span lang="hbo-Latn">Sh&acirc;ne,</span> bright red (the plural
<span lang="hbo-Latn">sh&acirc;nim,</span> as in Prov. xxxi.&nbsp;21, signified materials
dyed with <span lang="hbo-Latn">sh&acirc;ni</span>) and <span lang="hbo-Latn">tol&acirc;,</span> warm colour,
are simply different names for the same colour,
viz., the crimson obtained from the cochineal
insect, <span lang="la">color coccineus.</span></p>

<p>The representation of the work of grace promised
by God as a change from red to white
is founded upon the symbolism of colours,
quite as much as when the saints in the Revelation
(ch. xix.&nbsp;8) are described as clothed in white
raiment, whilst the clothing of Babylon is purple
and scarlet (ch. xvii.&nbsp;4). Red is the colour of fire,
and therefore of life: the blood is red because
life is a fiery process. For this reason the
heifer, from which the ashes of purification
were obtained for those who had been defiled
through contact with the dead, was to be red;
and the sprinkling-bush, with which the unclean
were sprinkled, was to be tied around with a
band of scarlet wool. But red, as contrasted
with white, the colour of light (Matt. xvii.&nbsp;2),
is the colour of selfish, covetous, passionate life,
is which is self-seeking in its nature, which goes
out of itself only to destroy, and drives about
with wild tempestuous violence: it is therefore
the colour of wrath and sin. It is generally
supposed that Isaiah speaks of red as the colour
of sin, because sin ends in murder; and this
is not really wrong, though it is too restricted.
Sin is called red, inasmuch as it is a burning
heat which consumes a man, and when it breaks
forth consumes his fellow-man as well. According
to the biblical view, throughout, sin stands
in the same relation to what is well-pleasing
to God, and wrath in the same relation to love
or grace, as fire to light; and therefore as red
to white, to black to white, for red and black
are colours which border upon one another.
In the Song of Solomon (ch. vii.&nbsp;5), the black
locks of Shulamith are described as being &ldquo;like
purple,&rdquo; and Homer applies the same epithet
<span class="pagenum" id="p53">[p.&nbsp;53]</span>
to the dark waves of the sea. But the ground
of this relation lies deeper still. Red is the
colour of fire, which flashes out of darkness
and returns to it again; whereas white, without
any admixture of darkness, represents the pure,
absolute triumph of light. It is a deeply significant
symbol of the act of justification.
Jehovah offers to Israel an <span lang="la">actio forensis,</span> out
of which it shall come forth justified by grace,
although it has merited death on account of
its sins. The righteousness, white as snow and
wool, with which Israel comes forth, is a gift
conferred upon it out of pure compassion,
without being conditional upon any legal performance
whatsoever.&mdash;<i>Delitzch, Commentary on
Isaiah,</i> vol. i. pp. 98, 99.</p>

<p>A subordinate point in the imagery is, that
scarlet and crimson were the <i>firmest</i> of dyes,
least capable of being washed out.&mdash;<i>Dr. Kay.</i></p></div>

The strong men are fallen; even Solomon
himself, and David, and Noah, and Lot, and
Samson, and Peter, the lights of the world, fell
like stars from heaven. These tall cedars,
strong oaks, fair pillars, lie in the dust, whose
tops glittered in the air; that &ldquo;they which
think they stand may take heed lest they fall.&rdquo;
Can I look upon these ruins without compassion?
or remember them without fear, unless I
be a reprobate, and my heart of flint? Who
am I that I should stand like a shrub, when
these cedars are blown down to the ground, and
showed themselves but men? The best man
is but a man: the worst are worse than beasts.
No man is untainted but Christ. They who
had greater gifts than we, they who had deeper
roots than we, they who had stronger hearts
than we, they who had more props than we, are
fallen like a bird which is weary of her flight,
and turned back like the wind, in the twinkling
of an eye. What shall we do then, when
we hear of other men&rsquo;s faults? Not talk of
them as we do, but beware by them, and think&mdash;Am
I better than he? Am I stronger than
Samson? Am I wiser than Solomon? Am I
chaster than David? Am I soberer than Noah?
Am I firmer than Peter? There is no salt but
may lose its saltiness, no wine but may lose its
strength, no flower but may lose its scent, no
light but may be eclipsed, no beauty but may
be stained, no fruit but may be blasted, no soul
but may be corrupted. We stand all in a slippery
place, where it is easy to slide and
hard to get up.&mdash;<i>Henry Smith,</i> 1592.</p></div>

Man may be willing to forgive a mite,
the Lord a million; three hundred pence and
ten thousand talents are all one to His mercy.&mdash;<i>Adams</i>, 1653.</p>

<p>He is rich in mercy, abundant in goodness
and truth. Thy sins are like a spark of fire
that falls into the ocean, it is quenched presently;
so are all thy sins in the ocean of
God&rsquo;s mercy. There is not more water in the
sea than there is mercy in God.&mdash;<i>Manton,</i>
1620&ndash;1667.</p>

<p>Why dost thou not believe in God&rsquo;s mercy?
Is it thy sins discourage? God&rsquo;s mercy can
pardon great sins, nay, because they are great
(Ps. xxv.&nbsp;11). The sea covers great rocks as

Joy is the highest testimony that can be
given to our complacency in any thing or person.
Love or joy is a fuel to the fire; if love
lay little fuel of desires on the heart, then the
flame of joy that comes thence will not be
great. Now God&rsquo;s joy is great in pardoning
poor sinners that come in; therefore His affection
is great in the offer thereof. It is made
the very motive that prevails with God to
pardon sinners, &ldquo;Because He delighteth in
mercy,&rdquo; &ldquo;Who is a God like unto Thee, that
pardoneth iniquity, and passeth by the transgression
of the remnant of His heritage? He
retaineth not His anger for ever, for He
delighteth in mercy.&rdquo; God doth all this,
&ldquo;because He delighteth in mercy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ask why the fisher stands all night with his
angle in the river; he will tell you, because he
delights in the sport. Well, you know now the
reason why God stands so long waiting on
sinners, months, years, preaching to them; it
is that He may be gracious in pardoning them,
and in that act delight Himself. Princes very
often pardon traitors to please others more
than themselves, or else it would never be
done; but God doth it chiefly to delight and
gladden His own merciful heart. Hence the
business Christ came about (which was no other
but to reconcile sinners to God) is called &ldquo;the
pleasure of the Lord&rdquo; (Isa. liii.&nbsp;10).&mdash;<i>Gurnall,</i> 1617&ndash;1679.</p>

<p>Many people get a wrong idea of God by
thinking of Him as infinite only in justice and
power; but infinite applies to the feelings of
God as much as to the stretch of His right
hand. There is nothing in His nature which
is not measureless. Many think God sits
brooding in heaven, as storms brood in summer
skies, full of bolts and rain, and believe
that they must come to Him under the covert
of some apology, or beneath some umbrellaed
excuse, lest the clouds should break, and the
tempest overwhelm them. But when men repent
towards God, they go not to storms, but
to serene and tranquil skies, and to a Father
who waits to receive them with all tenderness
and delicacy and love. His eye is not dark
<span class="pagenum" id="p54">[p.&nbsp;54]</span>
with vengeance, nor His heart turbulent with
wrath; and to repent towards His justice and
vindictiveness must always be from a lower
motive than to repent towards His generosity
and love. When you wish to please God, treat
Him as one who feels sorry for sinners; treat
Him as one who longs to help those who need
help; go to Him confidingly. No matter how
bad you are&mdash;the worse the better. Old Martin
Luther said, &ldquo;I bless God for my sins.&rdquo; He
would never have had such a sense of the pardoning
mercy of God if he had not himself
been sinful. But as much as you are wicked,
God is glorious in restoring you to purity.
Let Him do for you those things which are the
most generous and magnanimous, and that will
please Him best. He is a Being whose feelings
and affections move on such vast lines of latitude
and longitude, that the more you presume
upon His goodness, and cast yourself before
Him saying, &ldquo;I need a miracle of grace and
mercy,&rdquo; the better He is pleased.</p>

<p>Now I beseech you to kindle up a thought
of what your mother would do if you were a
sinful, heart-broken, discouraged man, but
repentant, saying, &ldquo;I have trod the thorny
way of life, and learned its mischief, can you,
mother, help me to begin anew?&rdquo; What
mother would cast away such a son? What
father would not receive a son on such terms?
And if earthly parents can lift themselves up
into feelings of holy sympathy for a repentant
child, what must be the feelings of God
when His children come to him for help to break
away from sin, and to lead lives of rectitude?
Read the 15th chapter of Luke, and find out
what God&rsquo;s feelings are; and then say, &ldquo;I will

<h3 class="tdc" id="o34"><span class="smcap">Self-scrutiny in God&rsquo;s Presence.</span></h3>

<p class="bq">i.&nbsp;18. <i>Come now, and let us reason together, saith the Lord; Though your sins be as
scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they be red like crimson, they shall be
as wool.</i></p>

<p>The outflow of holy displeasure contained
in the earlier portions of this
chapter would prepare us to expect an
everlasting reprobacy of the rebellious
and unfaithful Church, but it is strangely
followed by the most yearning and
melting entreaty ever addressed by the
Most High to the creatures of His footstool.</p>

<p>I. The text represents God as saying
to the transgressors of His law, &ldquo;Come
and let us reason together.&rdquo; The first
lesson to be learned, consequently, is
<b>the duty of examining our moral
character and conduct along with God.</b>
When a responsible being has made a
wrong use of his powers, nothing is more
reasonable than that he should call himself
to account for this abuse. Nothing,
certainly, is more necessary. There can
be no amendment for the future until
the past has been cared for. But that
this examination may be both thorough
and profitable, it must be made in
company with the Searcher of hearts.
For there are always two beings who
are concerned with sin: the being who
commits it, and the Being against whom
it is committed. Whenever, therefore,
an examination is made into the nature
of moral evil as it exists in the individual
heart, both parties concerned
should share in the examination. Such
a joint examination as this produces a
very keen and clear sense of the evil
and guilt of sin. Conscience, indeed,
makes cowards of us all, but when the
eye of God is felt to be upon us, it
smites us to the ground. 1.&nbsp;When the
soul is shut up along with the Holy
One of Israel, there are great searchings
of heart. Man is honest and anxious
at such a time. His usual thoughtlessness
and torpidity upon the subject of
religion leave him, and he becomes a
serious and deeply-interested creature.
2.&nbsp;Another effect of this &ldquo;reasoning
together&rdquo; with God respecting our
character and conduct is to render our
views discriminating. The action of
the mind is not only intense, it is also
intelligent. The sinner knows that he
is wrong, and his Maker is right&mdash;that
he is wicked, and that God is holy. He
perceives these two fundamental facts
with a simplicity and a certainty that
admit of no debate. The confusion and
obscurity of his mind, and particularly
the queryings whether these things are
so, begin to disappear like a fog when
disparted and scattered by sunrise.
Objects are seen in their true proportions
and meanings; right and wrong,
the carnal mind and the spiritual mind,
<span class="pagenum" id="p55">[p.&nbsp;55]</span>
heaven and hell&mdash;all the great contraries
that pertain to the subject of religion&mdash;are
distinctly understood, and
thus the first step is taken towards a
better state of things in the
<span class="wnsw">soul.<a id="o34_fna1" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#o34_fn1">[1]</a></span></p>

<p>II. The second lesson taught in the
text is, that <b>there is forgiveness with
God.</b> If mercy were not a manifested
attribute of God, all self-examination,
and especially all this conjoint Divine
scrutiny, would be a pure torment and
a pure gratuity. We have the amplest
assurance in the whole written revelation
of God, but no where else, that
&ldquo;there is forgiveness with Him, that
He may be feared.&rdquo; The text is an
exceedingly explicit assertion of this
great truth. The very same Being who
invites us to reason with Him and canvass
the subject of our criminality, in
the very same breath, if we may so
speak, assures us that He will forgive
all that is found in this examination.
And upon such terms cannot the criminal
well afford to examine into his
crime? The Divine pity outruns and
exceeds the crime. Paradoxical as it
may appear, self-examination, when
joined with a distinct recognition of
the Divine character, and a conscious
sense of God&rsquo;s scrutiny, is the surest
means of producing in a guilty mind a
firm conviction that God is merciful,
and is the swiftest way of finding Him
to be so. Abhorrent as iniquity is to
the pure mind of God, it is nevertheless
a fact that that sinner who goes directly
into this Dread Presence with all his
sins upon his head, in order to know
them, to be condemned and crushed by
them, and to confess them, is the one
who soonest returns with peace and
hope in his soul. For he discovers that
God is as cordial and sincere in His
offer to forgive as He is in His threat
to punish; and having, to his sorrow,
felt the reality and power of the Divine
anger, he now, to his joy, feels the equal
reality and power of the Divine love.
And this is the one great lesson which
every man must learn, or perish for
ever.</p>

<p>From these two lessons of our text
we deduce the following practical directions&mdash;1.&nbsp;<i>In
all states of religious anxiety
we should betake ourselves instantly and
directly to God;</i> there is no other refuge
for the human soul but God in Christ.
Are we sinners, and fear for the final
result of our life? Though it may seem
like running into fire, we must, nevertheless,
betake ourselves first and immediately
to that Being who hates and punishes
sin (1&nbsp;Chron. xxi.&nbsp;13). 2.&nbsp;<i>In
all our religious anxiety we should make
a full and plain statement of everything to
God.</i> Even when the story is one of
shame and remorse, we find it to be
mental relief, patiently, and without
any reservation or palliation, to expose
the whole, not only to our own eye,
but to that of our Judge. For to this
very thing have we been invited. This
is precisely the &ldquo;reasoning together&rdquo;
which God proposes to us. God has
not offered clemency to a sinful world
with the expectation or desire that
there be, on the part of those to whom
it is offered, such a stinted and meagre
confession, such a glossing over and
diminution of sin, as to make that clemency
appear a very small matter.
He well knows the depth and the
immensity of the sin which He proposes
to pardon, and has made provision accordingly.
In the phrase of Luther, it
is no painted sinner who is to be forgiven,
and it is no painted Saviour who
is offered. The transgression is deep
and real, and the atonement is deep and
real. The crime cannot be exaggerated,
neither can the expiation. He, therefore,
who makes the plainest and most
childlike statement of himself to God,
acts most in accordance with the mind
and will and gospel of God. If man
can only be hearty, full, and unreserved
in confession, he will find God to be
hearty, full, and unreserved in absolution.&mdash;<i>W.&nbsp;G.&nbsp;T.
Shedd, D.D., The American
Pulpit of the Day,</i> vol. i. pp. 829&ndash;842.</p>

<div class="footnotes"><h4 class="tdc">FOOTNOTES:</h4>
<div class="footnote" id="o34_fn1"><p><a href="#o34_fna1"><span class="label">[1]</span></a>
Man is not straitened upon the side of
the Divine mercy. The obstacle in the way of
his salvation is in himself; and the particular,
fatal obstacle consists in the fact that he does
not feel that he needs mercy. God in Christ
stands ready to pardon, but man, the sinner,
stands up before Him, like the besotted
criminal in our courts of law, with no feeling
upon the subject. The Judge assures him that
<span class="pagenum" id="p56">[p.&nbsp;56]</span>
He has a boundless grace and clemency to
bestow; but the sinful, hardened man is not
even aware that he has committed a dreadful
crime, and needs grace and clemency. There
is food in infinite abundance, but no hunger
upon the part of the man. The water of life
is flowing by in torrents, but men have no thirst.
In this state of things nothing can be done but
to pass a sentence of condemnation. God cannot
forgive a being who does not even know
that he needs to be forgiven. Knowledge,
then, self-knowledge, is the great requisite;
and the want of it is the cause of perdition.
This &ldquo;reasoning together&rdquo; with God, respecting
our past and present character and conduct,
is the first step to be taken by any one who
would make preparation for eternity. As soon
as we come to a right understanding of our
lost and guilty condition, we shall cry, &ldquo;Be
merciful to me, a sinner; create within me a
clean heart, O God.&rdquo; Without such an understanding&mdash;such
an intelligent perception of
our sin and guilt&mdash;we never shall, and we
never can.&mdash;<i>Shedd.</i></p></div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 class="tdc" id="o35"><span class="smcap">Sinners Self-destroyed.</span></h3>

<p class="bq">i.&nbsp;19&ndash;20. <i>If ye be willing and obedient, ye shall eat the good of the land; but if ye
refuse and rebel, ye shall be destroyed with the sword: for the mouth of the Lord hath
spoken it.</i></p>

<p>Delitsch translates&mdash;<i>&ldquo;If ye then shall
willingly hear, ye shall eat the good of the
land; if ye shall obstinately rebel, ye shall
be eaten by the sword: For the mouth of
Jehovah hath spoken it.&rdquo;</i></p>

<p>Stranchey translates&mdash;<i>&ldquo;If ye be willing
and obedient, ye shall feed on the good of
the land; but if ye refuse and rebel, the
sword shall feed on you,&rdquo;</i> which brings
out one of the contrasts of the verse
still more clearly. &ldquo;The promise of
eating, <i>i.e.,</i> of the full enjoyment of
domestic blessings, and therefore of
settled, peaceful rest at home, is placed
in contrast with the curse of being eaten
with the sword.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Delitsch.</i></p>

<p>Note the close connection between
these verses and verse 18. God condescends
to invite rebels to a conference
with Himself, He is willing to
grant them the fullest forgiveness;
but it is on the condition of future
obedience. On this condition He is
prepared to do more than forgive them,&mdash;He
will enrich them with all needful
blessings, of which peaceful enjoyment
of the fruits of the earth is here named
as a symbol; but if they will not listen
to His invitation, accept His gracious
offer, and yield the obedience He righteously
demands, then the vengeance
they have deserved will come upon
them. They have the matter entirely
in their own hands; it rests with them
to determine whether their future shall
be one of happiness or misery. Thus
we are led to the great doctrine of
these verses, that <i>sinners are self-destroyed.</i></p>

<p>This is a doctrine frequently insisted
on in Scripture (Ezek. xxxiii.&nbsp;11; 2&nbsp;Sam.
xiv.&nbsp;14; Hos. xiii.&nbsp;9; 2&nbsp;Pet. iii.&nbsp;9).
It is true in a twofold sense. <b>1.&nbsp;They
sin voluntarily.</b> God never foreordained
any man to work
<span class="wsnw">iniquity.<a id="o35_fna1" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#o35_fn1">[1]</a></span>
Some are indeed surrounded from
their birth by evil influences, and on
this account, as well as on account of
that corrupt nature which we all inherit,
they do sinful acts from their infancy,
but they do not <i>sin</i> until the dawn of
moral consciousness; and after that,
every act of iniquity they perpetrate
they perpetrate voluntarily. <b>2.&nbsp;They
suffer voluntarily.</b> They do not merely
expose themselves to the penalty of
sin, they take it upon them voluntarily.
God offers to remit it, on condition of
their repentance, but they reject the
proffered boon; like a suicide who
repels the surgeon who would close his
bleeding wounds.</p>

<p>In this fact that sinners thus destroy
themselves we have&mdash;<b>I.&nbsp;A terrible illustration
of the depth of human depravity.</b>
Sinners not only hate God so
much as to break His laws, but so
much as to harden themselves against
His love, and to reject His mercy.
<b>II.&nbsp;A sufficient vindication of the
severities of the Divine justice.</b> 1.&nbsp;No
sinner in hell will be able to reproach
God for his misery. 2.&nbsp;We who contemplate
the awful fact that human
<span class="pagenum" id="p57">[p.&nbsp;57]</span>
souls are suffering in hell have no right
to reproach God for their sufferings.
These sufferers deliberately turned
their backs upon God and heaven, and
went of their own accord to perdition.</p>

<p><i>Application.</i>&mdash;1. Before you to-day
blessing and cursing, life and death
are set; choose ye which ye will. 2.&nbsp;&ldquo;If
ye be <i>willing,</i>&rdquo; God will open to you
all the treasures of His grace. But not
otherwise! He will compel no man
to accept His mercy. 3.&nbsp;Whatever be
your choice, God will ratify it. If you
choose destruction, you shall have it,
and then you will not be able to revoke
your choice (Prov. i.&nbsp;22&ndash;31).</p>

<div class="footnote" id="o35_fn1"><p><a href="#o35_fna1"><span class="label">[1]</span></a>
The argument which the fatalist bases
upon organisation is self-annihilating when
applied to the common relations of life. The
fatalist himself does not believe in his own
doctrine; in speculative reasoning he is eager
to charge moral crime upon organic defect;
yet, in practical magistracy, he arraigns and
condemns the criminal to punishment. But
how monstrous an outrage is this upon his own
creed! The criminal was compelled through
stress of organisation to commit the crime, yet
the fatalist punishes him for doing what he
could not help! Let the principle of the
fatalist be admitted, and there is an end to
all legislation&mdash;an end, indeed, to the social
compact itself. All associated life is regulated
by a system of restraints; but restraint implies
self-control, and self-control is directly opposed
to fatalism. Let a criminal plead that he could
not help committing a certain crime; and if
the judge allow the plea, he will at once treat
the criminal as a lunatic, and instruct the
officers of justice accordingly. Magistracy
proceeds upon the principle that men can
&ldquo;help&rdquo; committing crime. All human legislation
assumes a man&rsquo;s power of self-regulation,
and grounds itself on the grand doctrine of
man&rsquo;s responsibility to man. At this point,
upon the same principle in relation to God,
Theology says, You hold yourselves responsible
to one another on all social matters, you punish
the criminal, you ignore the plea of fatalism
on all questions of property, order, and security;
now go further, heighten your own social base,
carry out to their logical issues your own principles
and methods, and you will reach all that
God requires of man. If it be urged that God
gave the criminal his organisation, the objection
does not touch the argument. The argument
is, that in human consciousness the plea
of fatalism is ignored on all practical matters;
away beyond all written statutes there is a conviction
that man can regulate his actions, and
ought to be held responsible for such regulation.
Man himself thus, by his own conduct
and his own law, acquits God of all charge upon
this matter; the very recognition by the magistrate
of man&rsquo;s responsibility is itself a direct
acquittal of God from the accusations of fatalism.
God need not be interrogated upon the
subject, for the magistrate himself, faithful to
the consciousness of universal humanity, treats
the fatalistic theory as an absurdity.&mdash;<i>Joseph

<p>Let a man look steadily at the sun
for a few moments, and for a long time
afterwards he will see nothing else;
whithersoever he turns, he will behold
the sun. Some men have looked at
God&rsquo;s wondrous mercy so exclusively,
that they can see in Him and His
Word nothing but mercy, and they
doubt, and teach others to doubt,
whether God will fulfil His threatenings
against sin. Let such persons
consider these three facts&mdash;<b>I.&nbsp;That
God&rsquo;s justice requires that He should
execute His threatenings against iniquity.</b>
He Himself would commit a
frightful injustice, and would be the
worst active promoter and abettor of
evil in the universe, if He were to
treat all men alike. His mere delay
to take vengeance upon transgressors
gives rise to some of the most perplexing
of moral problems (Eccles. ix.&nbsp;2, 3;
Ps. lxxiii.&nbsp;1&ndash;9, &amp;c.), and if He were
never to do so, the whole universe
would be driven into atheism. This
is the tendency even of His merciful
delays (Ps. x.&nbsp;11; lxxiii.&nbsp;11, &amp;c.)
<b>II.&nbsp;That God&rsquo;s truth requires that
He should execute His threatenings
against iniquity.</b> &ldquo;The mouth of the
Lord hath spoken it,&rdquo; and shall He
not fulfil His Word? So settled is the
conviction of the human mind that He
must do so, that it has been found one
of the greatest obstacles to the reception
of the Gospel. How God can be
<span class="pagenum" id="p58">[p.&nbsp;58]</span>
truthful, and yet pardon the sinner, it
has transcended the human mind to
conceive. The atonement of Christ is
the <i>practical</i> solution of this mystery.
<b>III.&nbsp;That the history of His ancient
people shows that while in God there
is a goodness most marvellous and
tender, on account of which we should
praise Him evermore, there is also a
severity so terrible, that on account of
it all the world should stand in awe of
Him.</b> Remember what frightful calamities
(the sword, famine, pestilence,
exile) God sent upon His ancient
people in this world; and shall we
imagine that He who displayed such a
capacity for sternness in this world
will be found incapable of it in the
world which is to come? Let us dismiss
this delusion which is at once
utterly groundless and unspeakably
<span class="wsnw">dangerous.<a id="o36_fna1" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#o36_fn1">[1]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Application.</i>&mdash;1. True reverence for
God will lead us to accept with equal
implicitness all the disclosures which
He has been pleased to give of His
character He will be to us neither a
God all mercy nor a God all justice.
In Him both these high qualities are
found in equal perfection: they are not
opponents, but allies. Each is always
in absolute harmony with the other.
2.&nbsp;True reverence for God will lead us
to tremble in view of His threatenings,
as well as to rejoice in view of His
promises. 3.&nbsp;It is with the God of
the Bible, and not with the God of our
own sentimental fancies, that we shall
have to deal with at the last. 4.&nbsp;If
we take nature as our guide to the
interpretation of revelation, we shall
find it easier to believe in God&rsquo;s severity
than in His benignity. In nature
there are appalling indications of sternness.

If Scripture be certainly true, then the
most terrible passages in it are certainly true;
nothing is more hardly believed by men than
that which will be most tormenting to their
minds, when it is believed that none shall be
saved but the regenerate and holy; and those
that live not after the flesh, but the Spirit, and
love God in Christ above all the world, even
their own lives; and that, besides these few,
all the rest shall be tormented in hell for ever.
This is the doctrine that flesh and blood will
hardly down with. They say or think they
will never believe that God will be so unmerciful;
as if God must needs be less merciful than
man, because He is more just and holy, and
will not be so indulgent to their flesh and sin
as they are themselves, and would have Him
to be. And I have known even godly men,
through the remnant of their corruption and
darkness in the things of God, and the violence
of temptation, much troubled with their unbelief
in this particular. But God cannot lie
the Scripture being true, and the Christian
religion certainly true, every part of it must
needs be true. But because sensual nature
looks for sensible demonstration or proof, let
me ask the unbelievers this one question&mdash;&ldquo;Do
you believe that which you see and feel,
and all the world feels as well as you?&rdquo; You
know that all mankind liveth here a life of
trouble and misery; we come into the world
in a very poor condition, and we pass through
it in daily labour and sorrow, and we pass out
of it through the dreadful pangs of death.
What incessant labour have the most of them,
how much want and misery, how much care
and grief! Do you not see and feel how sicknesses
do torment us? When one pain is over,
another is at hand. Have you not seen some
under such terrible fits of the gout, or stone, or
other diseases, that they thought no torment
could be greater; some with their legs rotting
and must be cut off; some with loathsome
cancers and leprosies on them many years
together; some that have lost their eyesight,
have lost almost all the comfort of life; some
that never could see; some that never could
hear or speak? I have known some in such
pain that they have cried out they did not
believe there was greater in hell; some are
mad, and some idiots: are not all these in a
very miserable case? Now I would ask you
further if God may, without any unmercifulness,
do all this to men, and that as a chastisement
in the way to bring them to repentance;
if He may, without unmercifulness, make a
David cry out in misery, and wash his couch
with his tears; and make a Job to lie scraping
his sores on a dunghill; why should you think
he cannot, without unmercifulness, torment
incurable sinners in hell? Further, I would
ask you this question; suppose you had lived
in Adam&rsquo;s paradise, or some condition of pleasure
and rest, where you never had tasted of
sickness, or labour, or want, or feared death,
if God&rsquo;s Word had there told you, but that man
shall endure so much misery as I have
mentioned and men daily suffer, and should
die at last for his sin, would you have said,
&ldquo;I will never believe God would be so unmerciful?&rdquo;
You that say so now, would likely
have said so then in this case; for feeling the
pleasure yourselves, you would on the same
ground have said, &ldquo;God is unmerciful if He
should make man so miserable;&rdquo; and yet you
<span class="pagenum" id="p59">[p.&nbsp;59]</span>
see and feel that God doth it, and we know
that He is not unmerciful.&mdash;<i>Baxter,</i> 1615&ndash;1691.</p></div>

Suffering comes to us through and from
our whole nature. It cannot be winked out
of sight. It cannot be thrust into a subordinate
place in the picture of human life.
It is the chief burden of history. It is the
solemn theme of one of the highest departments
of literature, the tragic drama. It
gives to fictions their deep interest: it wails
through much of our poetry. A large part of
human vocations are intended to shut up some
of its avenues. It has left traces on every

God indeed tells us of Hell, but it is to
persuade us to flee to heaven; and as a skilful
painter fills the background of his picture
with his darker colours, God introduces the
smoke of torment, and the black thunderclouds
of Sinai, to give brighter prominence
to Jesus, the Cross of Calvary, and His love to
the chief of sinners.</p>

<p>His voice of terror is like the scream of the
mother-bird when the hawk is in the sky.
She alarms her brood, that they may run and
hide beneath her feathers; and as I believe
that God hath left that mother dumb unless
He had given her wings to cover them, I am
sure that He, who is very &ldquo;pitiful,&rdquo; and has
no pleasure in any creature&rsquo;s pain, had never
turned our eyes to the horrible gulf unless for
the voice that cries, &ldquo;Deliver from going
down to the pit, for I have found a ransom.&rdquo;</p>

<p>We had never heard of sin had there been
no Saviour. We had never heard of hell had
there been no heaven. &ldquo;Sufficient for the
day is the evil thereof.&rdquo; And never had Bible
light flashed before the eyes of the sleeping
felon, to wake him from his happy dream, but
that he might see the smiling form of Mercy,
and hear her as she says, with finger pointing
the way, &ldquo;Behold I have set before thee an
open door.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Guthrie.</i></p></div>

&ldquo;The faithful city is become an harlot:&rdquo;&mdash;Jerusalem,
the daughter of Zion, the wife of
the Holy One of Israel, has broken the bond
of her covenant with Him, has set at nought
the Divine constitution and order in which He
originally placed, and has continued to sustain
her: and, as the outward consequence and
sign of this spiritual defection, has actually
fallen to the worship of other gods. Throughout
this prophecy Isaiah dwells chiefly on the
sins of the princes and rulers of the nation,
and only incidentally on those of the people;
and accordingly he now dilates on the characteristic
vices of the former, which are the
fruits of their national unfaithfulness. Social
and political morality have vanished along with
religious faith; thieves and murderers are
found instead of virtuous citizens; the nobles
and men in authority are the first to break the
laws they should enforce; the administration
of justice is so corrupt that the judges take
bribes, connive at the robbers whose booty they
share, and permit the rich man to pervert the
law for the oppression of the fatherless and
widow, who have no patrons to demand, and
no money to buy, justice: and thus the aristocracy,
setting aside all belief that they hold
their wealth and power in trust from God for
the benefit of the people under them, do but
employ these as irresistible engines for breaking
down all rights that can oppose them in
their pursuit of luxury and vice.&mdash;<i>Strachey.</i></p></div>

Jerusalem was once full of such right;
and Righteousness was not merely there in the
form of a hastily-passing guest, but had come
down from above to take up her permanent
abode in Jerusalem: she tarried there day and
night, as if it were her home. The prophet
had in his mind the times of David and Solomon,
and also more especially the time of
Jehoshaphat (about one hundred and fifty years
before Isaiah&rsquo;s appearance), who restored the
administration of justice, which had fallen
into neglect since the closing years of Solomon&rsquo;s
reign and the time of Rehoboam and Abijah,
to which Asa&rsquo;s reformation had not extended,
and reorganized it entirely in the spirit of the
<span class="pagenum" id="p60">[p.&nbsp;60]</span>
law. It is possible also that Jehoiada, the high
priest in the time of Joash, may have revived
the institutions of Jehoshaphat so far as they
had fallen into disuse under his three godless
successors; but even in the second half of the
reign of Joash the administration of justice
fell into some disgraceful state, at least as
compared with the times of David, Solomon,
and Jehoshaphat, as that in which Isaiah found
it. The glaring contrast between the present
and the past is indicated by the expression

lodged in the city&mdash;not merely
visited it as a passing guest, but dwelt
in it as a permanent abode [Alexander
and Kay&mdash;&ldquo;had its <i>home</i> there&rdquo;]. No

<b>1.</b>&nbsp;<i>Let us do what we can to make our

the combined, resolute, and persevering

more than compensated. Righteousness
is a royal guest, ennobling and
enriching those with whom she dwells,
and peace, prosperity, and joy invariably
follow in her train. <b>II.&nbsp;A mournful
condemnation.</b> Righteousness
<i>lodged</i> in the city; lodged, not lodges!
That noble and Divine inhabitant is
departed. The palace in which she
dwelt is in ruins. 1.&nbsp;Of how many

achieved some if its first and
noblest triumphs are now Mohammedan
and semi-heathen. They did not hold
fast the truth, and now they are given
over to error. We boast that this is
a Christian land, but its relapse into
practical heathenism is not impossible.
In every action there is a constant
gravitation towards evil, which can
only be resisted and overcome by constant
effort and earnest prayer. Let
the churches of this land lay this
solemn fact to heart. 2.&nbsp;Of how many
<i>men</i> may this declaration be made!
How many even of the openly vicious
and criminal were once respectable
members of society&mdash;yes, even honoured
members of churches! They were
men &ldquo;subject to like passions as we
are;&rdquo; and in what they are we have
solemn warnings as to what we may
become. Let those who are most exalted,
not in privileges only, but in
moral excellence, also watch and pray,
lest sin enter even their hearts, and
expel that Divine guest whose presence
secures so many blessings and warrants
so many hopes.</p>

<h3 class="tdc" id="o39"><span class="smcap">The Possible Degeneracy of Valuable Things.</span></h3>

<p class="bq">i.&nbsp;22. <i>Thy silver is become dross.</i></p>

<p>There are many valuable and good
things in the world that through
varied causes are rendered comparatively
useless. They once were silver,
but now they are dross. <b>I.&nbsp;The silver
of thy character has become dross
because of little failings.</b> There have
been men known to all of us, of good
moral characters, of lofty and heroic
soul, but they were betrayed into occasional
<span class="wsnw">faults,<a id="o39_fna1" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#o39_fn1">[1]</a></span>
which many condoned,
which others magnified, but which
they themselves did not correct, until
at last their silver became dross. The
character depreciated in moral worth.
It was no longer current as a thing of
beauty. It had lost its value. <b>II.&nbsp;The
silver of thy service has become
dross because of unholy motives.</b>
Christian service is a good and
precious thing, but how frequently is
it rendered useless and vain by pride,
by thoughts of self, and by secular
<span class="wsnw">motive.<a id="o39_fna2" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#o39_fn2">[2]</a></span>
It is, indeed, as silver
<span class="pagenum" id="p61">[p.&nbsp;61]</span>
when rendered by a pure and loving
heart, but alas! it too often becomes
dross because of the unhallowed sentiment
of the soul. The mite of the
widow cast into the treasury was as
silver, but the munificent gifts of the
Pharisees were as dross. How much
of the service rendered to the great
God in the pulpit, pew, and school, is
but dross! This is a solemn thought.
<b>III.&nbsp;The silver of thy money has become
dross because of selfishness.</b> We
cannot estimate the wealth of a man
by the money he has in possession, but
often far better by the money he gives
away. When men keep their riches
to themselves, solely for their own use,
they cease to be rich&mdash;they are laden
with coin that is not current; their
silver has become dross. Liberality
makes money worth its
<span class="wsnw">value.<a id="o39_fna3" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#o39_fn3">[3]</a></span>
Generosity preserves wealth from all
degenerating influences. How many
so-called rich men have more dross
than silver in this world. <b>IV.&nbsp;The
silver of thy talents has become dross
because of indolence.</b> Silver is bright
when kept in use. Talents are valuable
when active. The mind has talents of
thought and sympathy and love. The
hand has talents of help. The mouth
has talents of blessing. Take care that
thy silver does not become as dross.&mdash;<i>J.&nbsp;S. Exell.</i></p>

You need not break the glasses of a telescope,
or coat them over with paint, in order
to prevent you from seeing through them. Just
breathe upon them, and the dew of your breath
will shut out all the stars. So it does not require
great crimes to hide the light of God&rsquo;s
countenance. Little faults can do it just as
well. Take a shield, and cast a spear upon it,
and it will leave in it one great dent. Prick
it all over with a million little needle shafts,
and they will take the polish from it far more
than the piercing of the spear. So it is not so
much the great sins which take the freshness
from our consciences, as the numberless petty
faults which we are all the while committing.&mdash;<i>Beecher.</i></p></div>

Our end or motive in acting determines
more than anything the quality of our actions.
Not that a good end will sanctify a bad action,
but a bad end will vitiate every action connected
with it. If, for instance, in our religious
services we seek the applause of men, we
must expect no reward from God, the gratification
of our pride and vanity is all the reward
that such polluted services can obtain. In the
account which is given of Jehu, we find that
the very same action which was rewarded on
account of its outward conformity with God&rsquo;s
command, was punished on account of the base
principle by which he was influenced in performing
it. He did well in extirpating the
seed of Ahab, and was rewarded for it to the
fourth generation: the blood which was shed
was imputed to him as murder. Nor is there
anything more common than for even religious
persons to mistake the path of duty through
an inattention to their own spirit. The disciples
doubtless thought themselves under the
influence of a commendable zeal when they
would have called fire from heaven to consume
a Samaritan village; as did Peter, also, when
he cut off the ear of Malchus. We should
therefore be peculiarly cautious with respect
to this, lest by the mixture of any selfish
motive or base affection we offend Him whom
it is our desire and endeavour to please.&mdash;<i>Simeon.</i></p></div>

them before us into heaven, delivering them

and so having conveyed and made

we shall find the Lord a sure and all-sufficient
paymaster, who will give us more than double
usance, and yet pay us at the first sight. If
we would have our coin continue sweet and

are for this purpose no garners comparable to

Christ&rsquo;s prayer, &ldquo;Father, forgive them;

your transgressions you invade them.
Your sins are <i>trespasses.</i> God feels
toward you as the French feel towards
the Germans who have taken possession
of and settled down in Alsace and
Lorraine; you put upon God an indignity
which He cannot and will not
bear. <b>III.</b>&nbsp;That while God endures
your trespasses for a time, in the
merciful hope that by His forbearance
you may be led to repentance, <b>He

At this first step we might reason on
the testimony if we pleased, instead of accepting
it, and raise the objection that to imagine
passion in God, especially so turbid a passion
as anger, conflicts with our notions of His
character, and degrades Him in our apprehensions.
Beware! remember that in forming
an estimate of the character and proceedings
of God, we are but little children forming an
estimate of the character and proceedings of a
man of matured experience. Were it not more
reasonable, as well as more reverent, to accept
what He says, and to leave Him afterwards to
clear up any mystery which may envelope His
nature? I can indeed conceive in Him nothing
turbid, impetuous, or impulsive, such as sullies
the clearness of the human will. But this I
can conceive, that there is in Him some high
perfection (more incomprehensible to my
finite capacity than the speculations of an
astronomer to a peasant child), of which anger
is the most adequate exponent to my mind,
and which I must be content to think of and
speak of as anger, or else to remain in total
ignorance of it. And this also I can&mdash;not
only conceive, but most readily assent to, that
in an absolutely perfect nature there should be
an utter abhorrence of, and antipathy to,
moral evil, most justly represented to simple
minds by the terms &ldquo;anger,&rdquo; &ldquo;curse.&rdquo; We
have never seen a perfect character; no perfect
character, save one, ever moved upon the
earth: but the righteous man, who is striving
after and approximating to perfection, has
often crossed our path; and surely we have
marked in him, that the more righteous he is,
the more doth he abhor (in the language of
Holy Scriptures) everything that is evil. What
is the effect upon one who breathes habitually
the atmosphere of communion with God, of
catching in the current tidings of the day
the intelligence of some awful outburst of depravity?
When such an one passes on an
errand of mercy through the crowded alleys of
a great city, and the shouts of malignant execration
and profaneness ring in his ear, or
with what feeling does he encounter these
symptoms of human degradation? Are they
not like a foul odour to his nostrils, or a
jarring note to his ear, or an abortion to his
sight? Does he not turn away with loathing,
and recoil from such scenes and such sounds
with an antipathy strong in proportion to his
goodness? And is it, then, so hard to conceive
that in perfect goodness there may be a recoil
from moral evil, something similar in kind to
this, though infinitely stronger in degree?
And is not such a recoil righteous, and a
token of righteousness?&mdash;<i>Goulburn.</i></p></div>

other world. If we refuse mercy here, we
shall have justice there.&mdash;<i>Jeremy Taylor,</i> 1612&ndash;1667.</p></div>

<p>The denunciation of the iniquity of
Jerusalem (vers. 21&ndash;23) is followed by
a solemn announcement of God&rsquo;s determination
to punish it. <b>I.&nbsp;God will
certainly punish sin.</b> &ldquo;Ah, I will ease
me of mine adversaries, and avenge me
of mine enemies.&rdquo; See preceding outline,
and <a href="#o36">that on verse 20.</a> <b>II.&nbsp;In
punishing sin God is not moved by any
vindictive purpose.</b> True, He speaks
here of taking vengeance upon His
enemies, but these words coming from
the lips of Jehovah must not be interpreted
as we should have to interpret
them if they came from the lips of a
Genghis Khan or a Tippoo Saib. We
must remember that this is the utterance
of the Mighty One of Israel, who
is infinitely uplifted above every unholy
passion. Whatever misconstruction
the phrase, taken alone, might be open
to, is entirely obviated by the declarations
which follow it, which teach us&mdash;<b>III.&nbsp;That
God&rsquo;s aim even in the severest
chastisements is the reformation
of the offenders, and their restoration
to true blessedness.</b> For what purpose
will He turn His hand upon Jerusalem?
Not that He may destroy her, but that
He may purify her, as silver is purified
in the furnace; and through this painful
process she is caused to pass, that
she may be restored to her former dignity
and blessedness.  It is for these
purposes that God chastises nations and
individuals to-day.</p>

<p><i>Application.</i>&mdash;1. Those who are living
sinful lives may certainly expect severe
judgments. Sin and sorrow are inseparably
linked, and God is solemnly
pledged not to &ldquo;clear&rdquo; the guilty. 2.&nbsp;Those
on whom judgments on account
of sin have fallen should neither despise
them nor be driven by them to despair
(Heb. xii.&nbsp;5). These are two great
evils. Indifference to chastisement
brings on still severer <span class="wsnw">strokes.<a id="o41_fna1" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#o41_fn1">[1]</a></span>
God will break the stubborn sinners who
refuse to bend (ver. <span class="wsnw">28).<a id="o41_fna2" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#o41_fn2">[2]</a></span>
Despair defeats the very object for which our
chastisements are sent, and is itself a
grievous offence against God. Instead
of yielding to despair, we should be filled
with hope, for God has loving purposes
towards us, and our prayer should be,
not that the afflictions should be removed,
but that God&rsquo;s purposes in them
should be fulfilled. It is worth while
to go into the furnace, if thereby we
may be cleansed from the dross by
which we are defiled.</p>

cauterising knife, and take off the joint or
member that is so ill affected. Even so God,
when men profit not by such crosses as He
hath formerly exercised them with, when they
are not bettered by lighter afflictions, then He
sends heavier, and proceeds from milder to
sharper courses. If the dross of their sin will
not come off, He will throw them into the

harder in the press, and lay on such irons as
shall enter more deeply into their souls. If

<h3 class="tdc" id="o42"><span class="smcap">The Divine Idea of Redemption.</span></h3>

<p class="bq">i.&nbsp;25, 26. <i>And I will turn my hand upon thee, and purely purge away thy dross,
and take away thy tin: and I will restore thy judges as at the first, and thy
counsellors as at the beginning: afterward thou shalt be called, The city of righteousness,
The faithful city.</i></p>

<p>We have here the promise of a
redemption which God would accomplish
for Jerusalem, and from the terms
of the promise, especially taken in connection
with the preceding statements
(vers. 21&ndash;23), we may learn what God&rsquo;s
idea of redemption is: it is to purge
away all that debases and to restore
all that is lost. In other words, <i>redemption
consists in restoration to the Divine
ideal.</i> Such was the redemption which
God promises to accomplish for Jerusalem;
such is the redemption which
He offers to accomplish for us. Here
we have&mdash;</p>

<p><b>I. A correction of a common error.</b>
Most men, when they hear of redemption,
think of it merely as salvation
from suffering, rescue from the peril
of hell. This is a <i>consequence</i> of redemption,
but redemption consists in the
cleansing of our nature from all defilement,
and in our restoration to the
Divine ideal of humanity (Col. iii.&nbsp;10;
Eph. iv.&nbsp;24, 13). God is going to do
something grander for us than save us
from hell. He is going to make us
&ldquo;meet&rdquo; for heaven (1&nbsp;John iii.&nbsp;2). It
would be truer to say that God&rsquo;s idea
of redemption is &ldquo;salvation <i>by</i> suffering,&rdquo;
than to say that it is &ldquo;salvation
<i>from</i> suffering.&rdquo; The figure used in
the text is expressive of the keenest
suffering&mdash;&ldquo;I will purge away
thy dross.&rdquo; but dross is purged away
by <i>fire!</i> Suffering is one of the instruments
which God most frequently uses
to save men from sin.</p>

<p><b>II. A model for preachers.</b> Guided
by a Divine interpreter, the prophet
does not speak of happiness, but of
purity and righteousness; he names
these as the great favours which God
was about to bestow upon His people.
So should preachers to-day strive to
make men understand that <i>these</i> are the
greatest blessings which God can confer
upon man. All other blessings spring
from them; as all social blessings are
secured to a community when its
&ldquo;judges&rdquo; are righteous and its &ldquo;counsellors&rdquo;
fear God. Let preachers do
their utmost to make it plain to the
man of this generation, that just as if
we have the sun we shall have light
and heat, so if they have purity, they
shall have peace; if they attain to
holiness, they shall attain to a nobler
and completer happiness than those
who long for happiness merely ever
dream.</p>

<p><b>III. An ennobling ideal to be striven
after by all men.</b> Happy is the man
who has a great purpose in life. And
what is the purpose with which a study
of our text should inspire us? Not
merely to &ldquo;flee from the wrath to
come,&rdquo; but to become &ldquo;partakers of
the Divine nature,&rdquo; and so to attain
to God&rsquo;s ideal of humanity. God is
striving to restore us to His own likeness:
let us do all that in us lies to
help on this restoration (Phil. ii.&nbsp;12, 13).
The &ldquo;salvation&rdquo; we are to &ldquo;work
out&rdquo; is not salvation from guilt (<i>that</i>
is Christ&rsquo;s work, accomplished by Him
once for all on the cross), but from the
indwelling corruption which is to us
what dross is to the precious metals.
Nor are we merely to seek to put away
that which is <span class="wsnw">evil;<a id="o42_fna1" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#o42_fn1">[1]</a></span>
we are to strive to set up in us all noblenesses which are to
<span class="pagenum" id="p65">[p.&nbsp;65]</span>
character what &ldquo;judges&rdquo; and &ldquo;counsellors&rdquo;
are to a city (2&nbsp;Pet. i.&nbsp;5&ndash;7;
Phil. iv.&nbsp;8). Blessed is the man who
has this ideal in life. 1.&nbsp;<i>He is saved
from fear,</i> the haunting dread of failure
which oppresses those whose supreme
desire is merely to be saved from hell.
2.&nbsp;<i>He has a sustaining hope,</i> based
upon the sure promises of God&rsquo;s Word
(1&nbsp;Pet. i.&nbsp;10, 11). 3.&nbsp;<i>He has a present
and growing joy,</i> such as can come
only from self-conquest and moral progress.
The joy of &ldquo;the just,&rdquo; that is
of the men whose steadfast aim is
righteousness, is like &ldquo;the path of the
just&rdquo; (Prov. iv.&nbsp;18).</p>

Christianity ends not in negatives. No
man clears his garden of weeds but in order to
the planting of flowers or useful herbs in their
room. God calls upon us to dispossess our
corruptions, but it is for the reception of new
inhabitants. A room may be clean, and yet
empty; but it is not enough that our hearts
be swept, unless they be also garnished, or
that we lay aside our pride, our luxury, our
covetousness, unless humility, temperance, and
liberality rise up and thrive in their places.
The design of religion would be very poor and
short should it look no further than only to
keep men from being swine, goats, and tigers,
without improving the principles of humanity
into positive and higher perfections. The soul
may be cleansed from all blots, and yet still
be left but a blank. But Christianity is of a
thriving and aspiring nature, and requires us
to proceed from grace to grace (2&nbsp;Pet. i.&nbsp;5&ndash;7),
ascending by degrees, till at length the top of
the ladder reaches heaven, and conveys the
soul so qualified into the mansions of glory.&mdash;<i>South,</i> 1633&ndash;1716.</p></div>

<p>We have in the contest a picture of
a dismantled city, a disorganized community;
and here God tells us that
He will undertake the work of its reconstruction.
<b>I.&nbsp;All the arrangements
of society are absolutely in
God&rsquo;s hands.</b> &ldquo;<i>I</i> will restore,&rdquo; &amp;c.
No man can overturn, or build up, but
by His permission. On Him all projects
of national, social, or ecclesiastical
reconstruction depend for their success.
That on which He smiles flourishes;
that on which He frowns withers
away. Let reformers and reconstructors
of society remember and
recognise this great fact, that God
rules on earth as in heaven. <b>II.&nbsp;All
interruptions of social order are under
the control of God.</b> Revolutions occur
not by chance, nor by the will of
man, but by the will of God. They
occur only when, and continue only as long
as He pleases. By Him judges
and counsellors are swept away, and
by Him they are restored. No nation
is so broken that it cannot be uplifted
by Him to power and glory, &ldquo;as at
the first.&rdquo; <b>III.&nbsp;No social state can be
purified but by religious processes.</b>
There are many philanthropic and
political projects which have for their
aim national regeneration, but they are
all foredoomed to come to nought,
because they lack the religious element.
Moral reformation must go before social
advancement: a return to righteousness
is the first step to national
<span class="wsnw">exaltation.<a id="o43_fna1" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#o43_fn1">[1]</a></span>
<b>IV.&nbsp;The great name will follow the

Think not that any change in the form
of government would cure that which is
caused by the people&rsquo;s sin, or the common
depravity of human nature. Some think they
can contrive such forms of government as that
the rulers shall be able to do no hurt; but
either they will disable them to do good, or else
their engine is but glass, and will fail or break
when it comes to execution. Men that are
themselves so bad and unhumbled as not to
know how bad they are, and how bad mankind
is, are still laying the blame upon the form of
government when anything is amiss, and think
by a change to find a cure. As if when an
army is infected with the plague, or composed
of cowards, the change of the general or
form of government would prove a cure.

and the destruction of the transgressors and of the sinners shall be together, and they
that forsake the Lord shall be consumed.</i></p>

<p>These verses are closely and vitally
connected: it is a mistake to separate
them, as in the Authorised Version.
Their meaning would be conveyed to
the English reader, if they were translated&mdash;<i>&ldquo;Zion
shall be redeemed with
judgment, and her converts with righteousness;
and thereby also the transgressors
and sinners shall be destroyed, yea they
that forsake the Lord shall be</i>
<span class="wsnw"><i>consumed.&rdquo;</i><a id="o44_fna1" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#o44_fn1">[1]</a></span>
By judgment is meant the doom
which in the preceding verses had been
threatened against guilty Jerusalem
(<i>e.g.,</i> vers. 18): this &ldquo;judgment&rdquo; would
be a manifestation of God&rsquo;s punitive
righteousness, and the declaration is
that the infliction of this &ldquo;judgment&rdquo;
would have a twofold effect&mdash;it would
redeem Zion and her converts, and it
would destroy the transgressors and
sinners.</p>

<p><i>The diverse effects of Divine judgments</i>
is a matter well worthy of our study.
<b>I.&nbsp;One effect of those judgments by
which God manifests His righteous indignation
against sin is to redeem His
people from their transgressions.</b> A
prolonged period of peace and prosperity
such as the Jews enjoyed under
Uzziah is always perilous to the vital
religion of a nation. Formalism is
apt to prevail. The lines of demarcation
between the Church and the world
are apt to be effaced; &ldquo;Zion&rdquo; is apt to
become merged in &ldquo;Jerusalem.&rdquo; In
love to His people, God is therefore
compelled to send upon their nation
great calamities. These lead to searchings
of heart, and reformations of conduct
and character. Men learn again
to wait upon God, and reverently to
regard His will (ch. xxvi.&nbsp;9). The
Church shines once more with the glory
of spiritual conformity to God, and the
result is that she is increased by converts
from the world: to these also the
season of judgment is also the season
of redemption. But, <b>II.&nbsp;Another effect
of God&rsquo;s judgments is to harden the
obdurate.</b> His chastisements lead some
men to further acts of rebellion against
Him (ver. 8). Like Pharaoh, they
harden themselves more and more as
God sends plague after plague upon
them (Exod. viii.&nbsp;19, 32, &amp;c.) Hence
seasons of public calamity (such as that
of the plague in London, &amp;c.) have
always been seasons of public crime.
Transgressors madly dare Omnipotence
to a trial of strength, and the result is
their utter destruction.</p>

<p>Our object as thus unfolded gives
rise to the following practical reflections&mdash;1.&nbsp;In
a season of national or
individual prosperity we should be especially
watchful and prayerful against
conformity to the
<span class="wsnw">world.<a id="o44_fna2" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#o44_fn2">[2]</a></span>
2.&nbsp;We should not regard judgments that come
upon our nation or ourselves merely as
calamities: they may be God&rsquo;s angels
sent in truest mercy, and they bring
with them to the people of God great
moral and spiritual compensations. 3.&nbsp;Judgments,
when they come upon us,
afford us an admirable test of our real
character: if we be indeed the people
of God, they will lead us to submission
and to more earnest strivings after holiness;
but if they awaken within us a
spirit of murmuring, of repining, of resentment
against God, we have good
cause to suspect that our religion has
never been the work of God in our
<span class="wsnw">hearts.<a id="o44_fna3" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#o44_fn3">[3]</a></span>
4.&nbsp;In the season of judgment
we really have only one alternative
before us&mdash;to turn or burn. No stoutness
of heart will enable us to resist
God&rsquo;s consuming wrath against iniquity
(Mal. iv.&nbsp;1).</p>

with,&rdquo; the salvation of the penitent who
are brought back to God by correction, as is

How often does worldly prosperity tend
to this lapsing of the soul from God! How
often do our very outward mercies and blessings
superinduce this spiritual languor and
decay! It is with believers individually as
with the Church collectively&mdash;they are never
in a condition less favourable to spiritual health
and advancement than when they have no trial
or cross to brace their energies and invigorate
their graces. The soldier gets supine after
battle. History tells us how the bravest
veterans of the great Carthaginian general
got demoralized and degenerate when, victory
over, they sat down to rejoicing and revelry,
before the gates of Capus; they never were
the same heroes again.&mdash;<i>Macduff.</i></p></div>

Being by whom he was made an intelligent
and immortal creature. Every
discovery which reason opens to him
of the transcendent perfections of the
Lord of the universe urges the duty
of offering the homage of his heart and life.

<h3 class="tdc" id="o46"><span class="smcap">The Doom of the Apostates.</span></h3>

<span class="wsnw">they<a id="o46_fna1" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#o46_fn1">[1]</a></span> shall be

<p>In modern days, when men &ldquo;forsake
the Lord,&rdquo; they become simply irreligious&mdash;practical
atheists; but in ancient
times such men became idolaters, they
became worshippers of idols set up
under the &ldquo;oaks&rdquo; planted on the hilltops,
or in <span class="wsnw">gardens.<a id="o46_fna2" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#o46_fn2">[2]</a></span> It is almost
impossible for us to understand the
fascination of idol-worship, but it was
very powerful, and the idols were made
objects of passionate trust. They were
regarded as the strength of those who
served them. Trusting in their protection
their votaries went forth confidently
to battle. Defeat did not dispel
this delusion; it was interpreted to
mean merely that the god of the victors
was mightier than the god of the
vanquished. To men glorying in their
protection, the prophet predicts utter
destruction. You shall be consumed,
<span class="pagenum" id="p68">[p.&nbsp;68]</span>
he says; the day is at hand when ye
shall be caused to blush for your gods;
you yourselves shall be withered oaks,
and gardens without water; yea, your
idols, and ye who have made them,
for they are but things, the work of
your hands, shall be burned together
in unquenchable <span class="wsnw">fire.<a id="o46_fna3" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#o46_fn3">[3]</a></span> The theme
of these verses is therefore <i>the doom of
the apostates, and the objects of their
trust.</i></p>

<p><b>I. Idolatry is still the sin of our
race.</b> It is not confined to &ldquo;heathen&rdquo;
lands. There is no need in this land for
a proclamation of the first commandment.
For what is idolatry in the
essence? It is loving and trusting
some being or thing more than God.
Every man&rsquo;s god is what he lives for.
Hence the declaration that &ldquo;covetousness
is idolatry;&rdquo; it is <i>one</i> form of the
widespread sin. <b>II.&nbsp;The confidence
of men in their idols is still limitless
and exultant.</b> Every idolater is persuaded
that that which he lives for is
worth living for; this is the conviction
of the miser, the ambitious man, &amp;c.
<b>III.&nbsp;The time is at hand when the
falsity of this confidence shall be
exposed.</b> There are coming upon
those who cherish it calamities amid
which they will seek in vain for comfort
from their &ldquo;idols.&rdquo; How often
this is verified in daily life! In the
withered, desolate condition of those
who have forsaken the Lord how
awfully is their folly demonstrated!
<b>IV.&nbsp;Yea, there is a day appointed in
which all idolaters and their idols
shall be consumed together.</b> In the
day of judgment the worshippers of
Dagon, of Astarte, of Baal, and of
Brahm will not be the only persons on
whom utter destruction shall come:
those who have made gold their confidence,
&amp;c., shall be burned up, together
with their &ldquo;gods.&rdquo; The objects
of their trust shall be as powerless
as is &ldquo;tow&rdquo; to resist flame, and they
themselves shall be but as &ldquo;sparks,&rdquo;
swept away by the blast of the Divine
indignation.</p>

<p><i>Application.</i>&mdash;1. The day of judgment
is a great reality; it is no mere
dream of theologians, it is <span class="smcap">a tremendous
fact</span> with which we shall soon
be brought face to face. 2.&nbsp;This fact

In the judgments and the restoration
which the prophet foretells, he declares that the
people shall learn the worthlessness of the
idols which they have been worshipping under
the oak-trees, and in the sacred groves and
gardens. The worship of the high places
was partly a local worship of Jehovah, which
only became irregular and blameable in later
times; but there was also a widespread worship
of Baal, Astarte, and Molech, the old gods of
the Canaanites and other nations, in sacred
groves and gardens, as well as on the hill-tops&mdash;a
worship of impersonated and defiled sensuality
and cruelty&mdash;which sometimes even
established itself within the precincts of the
temple itself, and was still more readily blended
with, or substituted for, the worship of Jehovah
in the high places. And this idolatrous worship
was going on in Jud&aelig;a during the reigns
of Uzziah and Jotham, at the same time with
the temple services, as appears from 2&nbsp;Kings
xv.&nbsp;3, 4, compared with 2&nbsp;Chron. xxvii.&nbsp;2.
In the day of judgment and restoration, says
the prophet, these men who have been flourishing
in their sin like the oaks, and living
in pleasures like those of their well-watered
gardens, shall find that the idols to which
these oaks and gardens are dedicated have no
power to save them from a destruction which
shall make them &ldquo;as an oak whose leaf fadeth,
and as a garden that hath no water,&rdquo; images
which will be the more forcible if we remember
that in a southern climate trees fade
rather from excessive heat than from seasonable
<span class="pagenum" id="p69">[p.&nbsp;69]</span>
cold, and a garden without water is a
mere desert of sand. Then shall the strong,
the mighty, and the unjust ruler become tow,
and his idols, the work of his hands, a spark;
and shall both burn together, and no man
shall quench them.&mdash;<i>Strachey.</i></p></div>

The interpretation of verse 31 on which
the above outline is based is that of Calvin and
the earlier Protestant commentators. That
which in modern days has been almost universally
adopted, is given in the preceding
extract from Strachey, and the homiletic use
to which it may be put is indicated in the
next outline: &ldquo;The Tow and the Spark.&rdquo; We
are persuaded, however, that the earlier interpretation
is that which is most in harmony
with the scope of the whole passage. All the
ancient versions treat
<span lang="hbo-Hebr" dir="rtl">&#1495;&#1464;&#1505;&#1465;&#1503;</span>
as an abstract, meaning
<i>strength,</i> and Dr. Alexander admits that
&ldquo;this agrees well with its form, resembling that
of an infinitive or verbal noun.&rdquo; Latterly it
has become the fashion to translate it &ldquo;strong
man,&rdquo; but the harmony of the whole passage
is best maintained by rendering it <i>&ldquo;their
strength,&rdquo;</i> that is, that which the idolaters have
regarded as their &ldquo;strength,&rdquo; the deity in
whose protection they have trusted.</p></div>

in a prison nobly feasted, and nobly attended,
and bravely courted? or because he saw him
go up the ladder with a gold chain about his
neck, and a scarlet gown upon his back? or
because he saw him walk to the execution
through pleasant fields or delightsome
gardens? or because there went before him
drums beating, colours flying, and trumpets
sounding? &amp;c. Surely no! Oh, no more
should we envy the grandeur of the men of
the world, for every step they take is but a step
to an eternal execution.&mdash;<i>Brooks,</i> 1628&ndash;1680.</p>

<p>What reason have we to envy the wicked in
their riches and prosperity? If a man be
standing firmly on a river&rsquo;s bank, and sees
another gliding gaily but inevitably down to a
tremendous precipice below, shall he be envious
of the pleasant sail that intervenes before
the dread catastrophe? Shall he stand and
envy him, and wish to exchange places with
him? Oh no, but let him rather cry aloud,
and warn him of his danger. Let him hasten
to the rescue; throw out his arms with right
good-will, and if it may be, save a soul from
death.&mdash;<i>Nason.</i></p></div>

<h3 class="tdc" id="o47"><span class="smcap">The Tow and the Spark.</span></h3>

<p class="bq">i.&nbsp;31. <i>And the strong shall be as tow, and the maker of it as a spark, and they
shall both burn together, and none shall quench them.</i></p>

<p>For the phrases &ldquo;and the maker of
it,&rdquo; the margin reads, &ldquo;and his work.&rdquo;
So Alexander and Henderson. This
reading renders the passage intelligible
in meaning and terrible in import. It
then in simple, vivid manner sets forth
the reciprocal influence of the sinner
and his sin. The man in committing
sin degrades and enfeebles himself, and
then the sin he has committed reacts
upon his degraded and enfeebled
nature to kindle in it the fire of its
corruption. It is worth observing that
these terrible words of warning are not
levelled 1.&nbsp;against <i>low and vile people.</i>
The term &ldquo;strong&rdquo; precludes that
opinion. They are spoken against
those who have been, or are still,
esteemed, exalted, and powerful,&mdash;presumably
against the princes, the judges,
the counsellors of the nation (vers. 23&ndash;26).
Nor are they spoken 2.&nbsp;against
<i>the avowedly irreligious.</i> The people
addressed performed a multitude of
sacrifices (ver. 11), were punctilious in
their attendance on the house of God,
&amp;c. (vers. 12&ndash;14), were full of apparent
devotion (ver. 15). Nor 3.&nbsp;do they
refer to <i>the grosser forms of sin.</i> These
would of course come under the same
condemnation. But spiritual sins,
though more refined to our perception,
are more fatal even than sensual sins.
It is pre-eminently a spiritual sin in
root, however sensual in fruit, that is
here arrived at. It is all summed up
in the one evil, &ldquo;forsaking the Lord&rdquo;
(ver. 28). It is important to bear these
considerations in mind if we would
obtain personal and profitable application
of these words. Consider&mdash;</p>

<p><b>I. The radical change sin works in
the constitution of the sinner.</b> Sin is
lawlessness, an outbreak of self-will
(1&nbsp;John iii.&nbsp;4). It is conscious wrongdoing
(James iv.&nbsp;17). And sin, the
prophet says in effect, has a disintegrating,
deteriorating, degrading influence
upon the man&rsquo;s nature who
yields to it. &ldquo;The strong shall be as
<span class="pagenum" id="p70">[p.&nbsp;70]</span>
<i>tow.&rdquo; Tow</i> is the coarse, broken part
of flax or hemp&mdash;waste, refuse. Used
here in contrast to that which is strong.
Used also as pattern of that which is inflammable.
1.&nbsp;<i>Sin lowers the tone and
tenor of our nature.</i> Man&rsquo;s nature is
originally a very high nature. &ldquo;A
little lower than the angels&rdquo; (Ps. viii.&nbsp;5);
a little lower than <i>Divinity</i> (see
Alexander and Thrupp <i>in loc.</i>). Originally
a king with all highest forms
of existence grouped around his throne
(Ps. viii.&nbsp;6&ndash;8). He falls by sin. How
low? To the level of beasts that perish?
(Ps. xlix.&nbsp;20). Lower than that (Isa.
i.&nbsp;3). To level of trees and shrubs?
Lower than that. See, that heap of
coarse and tangled refuse was a plant
once, a living thing. Now it is cut
down, dried, dead; choicest parts
gone, wasted! <i>&ldquo;Tow&rdquo;</i>&mdash;that is the
symbol of the sinful man. The height
from which he has fallen measures the
degradation incurred. To that which
is by nature &ldquo;tow,&rdquo; it is no degradation
to be &ldquo;tow.&rdquo; But for that
which is &ldquo;strong&rdquo; to become &ldquo;tow&rdquo;&mdash;for
the highest of God&rsquo;s creations to
become as the lowest&mdash;this is disgraceful,
dreadful. 2.&nbsp;<i>Sin, depraving and
degrading the type and tenor of our nature,
enfeebles our powers of resistance to the
assaults of external evil.</i> Sin is weakness
as well as wickedness; weakness
as the result of wickedness. The
&ldquo;strong&rdquo; becomes as &ldquo;tow,&rdquo; becomes
<i>weak.</i> Hard to tell which is the worse
to bear, the paroxysms of remorse, or
the paralysis of power which the habit
of sin <span class="wsnw">engenders.<a id="o47_fna1" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#o47_fn1">[1]</a></span>
To feel that when
some &ldquo;temptation comes and calmly
states itself before us&rdquo; we are helplessly
a prey to it, is terrible indeed.
The first sin of any kind greatly facilitates
a second commission of the
<span class="wsnw">same;<a id="o47_fna2" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#o47_fn2">[2]</a></span>
and every repetition increases
that facility till the ease of
doing it almost amounts to a practical
inability to abstain from doing
<span class="wsnw">it.<a id="o47_fna3" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#o47_fn3">[3]</a></span>
Sin gets <i>dominion</i> over us.
Men are &ldquo;sold under sin.&rdquo; 3.&nbsp;<i>Sin
imparts to us an increased susceptibility
to evil</i>&mdash;makes us more inflammable.
And Satan&rsquo;s &ldquo;fiery darts&rdquo; striking,
inflame <span class="wsnw">us.<a id="o47_fna4" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#o47_fn4">[4]</a></span>
Some counsellors advise
young people to indulge in a certain
measure of sin as a remedy for its enkindling
impulses; they call it &ldquo;sowing
their wild oats.&rdquo; A figure is sometimes
the best vail for a fact. One would
think that &ldquo;sowing&rdquo; would of itself
suggest reproduction and multiplied
reproduction (Gal. vi.&nbsp;7, 8) If you
wish your nature to become hopelessly
inflammable, utterly uncontrollable,
give way to the indulgence of its hot
impulses while you are young.</p>

<p><b>II. The way in which the sinner and
his sin co-operate for their common
destruction.</b> We all know the influence
of coming into contact with
the instruments, the companions, the
locality even, of a former sin. They
stir up in us the memories, the emotions,
the impulse to the same transgression.
So the sinner goes about the
world setting new snares for his feet at
every turn as he sins. The relation of
sin to the sinner and to his sinful deed
is like that of a lamp placed between
two mirrors, which reflect and reflect
the light, till both the mirrors
seem full of lamps. Sin is ever more multiplying
itself between the sinner and
his sinful deed. And the issue is
irremediable ruin. &ldquo;They shall both
burn together, and none shall quench
them.&rdquo; And the moral is, that if we
would keep out of hell, we must keep
out of sin.&mdash;<i>W. Roberts, B.A.</i></p>

One of the affecting features in a life of
vice is the longing, wistful outlooks given by
the wretches who struggle with unbridled passions
towards virtue which are no longer
within their reach. Men in the tide of vice
are sometimes like the poor creatures swept
down the stream of mighty rivers, who see
people safe on shore, and trees and flowers, as
they go quickly past, and all things that are
desirable gleam upon them a moment to
heighten their trouble, and to aggravate their
swift-coming destruction.&mdash;<i>Beecher.</i></p></div>

A brand that has been once in the fire
easily catches the second time.&mdash;<i>Flavel,</i> 1630&ndash;1696.</p>

<p>Every commission of sin imprints upon the
soul further disposition and proneness to sin;
as the second, third, and fourth degrees of heat
are more easily introduced than the first. Every
one is both a preparative and a step to the next.
Drinking both quenches the present thirst and
provokes it for the future. When the soul is
<span class="pagenum" id="p71">[p.&nbsp;71]</span>
beaten from its first station, and the mounds
and earthworks of virtue are once broken down,
it becomes quite another thing from what it
was before. In one single eating of the forbidden
fruit, when the act is gone, yet the relish
remains; and the remembrance of the first is
an easy allurement to the second. One visit
is enough to begin an acquaintance; and this
point is gained by it, that when the visitant
comes again, he is no more a stranger.&mdash;<i>South,</i>
1633&ndash;1716.</p></div>

<div class="footnote" id="o47_fn3"><p><a href="#o47_fna3"><span class="label">[3]</span></a>
Sin is like the descent of a hill, where
every step we take increase the difficulty of
our return. Sin, in its habits, becomes stronger
every day&mdash;the heart grows harder, the conscience
grows duller, the distance between God
and the soul grows greater, and like a rock
hurled from a mountain&rsquo;s top, the further
we descend we go down, and down, and
down, with greater and greater rapidity.&mdash;<i>Guthrie.</i></p></div>

<div class="footnote" id="o47_fn4"><p><a href="#o47_fna4"><span class="label">[4]</span></a>
It is in our own bosom that the power of
temptation is found. Temptation is but a
spark; and if a spark fall upon ice, if it fall
upon snow, if it fall upon water, what is the
harm of a spark? But if it fall upon powder&mdash;the
powder is yours, the spark only is the
devil&rsquo;s.&mdash;<i>Beecher.</i></p>

<p>The power of temptation is in proportion to
the nature of the soul tempted. A thoughtless
miner takes an uncovered light into the
mine: where there is but little gas, there is
but a wavering and flickering of a transient
flame,&mdash;hardly flame, indeed; but where there
is an accumulation of gas, the uncovered light
occasions an explosion which shivers the rocks
and brings swift destruction upon all who are
in the mine. In both cases it was the same
mine, the same miner, but the condition of
the air was different. So is it with the fiery
darts of the wicked one; they are shot into
all human hearts, and just in proportion to
the materials, so to speak, which are to be
found there, will be the success or failure of
the enemy.&mdash;<i>Dr. Parker.</i></p></div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 class="tdc" id="o48"><span class="smcap">Isaiah&rsquo;s Vision of the Last Days.</span></h3>

<p class="bq">ii.&nbsp;1&ndash;5. <i>The word that Isaiah the son of Amoz saw, &amp;c.</i></p>

<p>1. The marvellous power of the ancient
prophets in giving embodiment
and figure to the Word of God. It was
a &ldquo;word&rdquo; that Isaiah saw; not that he
heard, but that shaped itself before his
vision, and made him glad, as if a new
star had arisen to guide him. 2.&nbsp;Isaiah
speaks with magnificent confidence as
to the summing up of earthly dispensations.
Casting his eye over all the uproar
and tumults of intervening time, he sees
a heavenly repose settling on the engagements
and destinies of mankind.
Herein is the peculiar power of the old
prophets, viz., that they did not confine
their attention within a brief and inadequate
period, but projected their minds
over historic spaces within which, so to
speak, God had room to disclose somewhat
of the proportions and significance
of His plans. The whole year can
never be judged from any one season.
The prophets seemed to see things in
their <i>wholeness,</i> and this made them
calm in the midst of transitory confusion
and distress. 3.&nbsp;The house of the
Lord is to be exalted above all rivalry.
The strength of the hills is to be a
pedestal for the sanctuary. At the last
right shall be uppermost, and holiness
supreme. In the &ldquo;last days&rdquo; the house
of the Lord shall exert a universal
fascination; nation shall challenge
nation to go up in holy and triumphant
procession to the heights of Zion; and
the voice of other allurements shall be
lost in the infinite charm of the invitation.
4.&nbsp;Nor is this to be the indulgence
of a mere sentiment; it will be
the expression of a desire to be spiritually
right, and thus to be spiritually
secure: &ldquo;He will teach us of His ways,
and we will walk in His paths.&rdquo; Lawless
sentiment is to have no place in
spiritual discipline. We are not called
to a high revel, but to a pure and tender
obedience to an unchangeable law.
5.&nbsp;The house of the Lord is to be a
centre of judgment and rebuke towards
people who are living in impiety and
political corruption. The consequence
of this judgment, if properly received,
will be the establishment and perpetuation
of righteous peace. When the
nations are right with God, they will
be right with each other. Merely negative
peace may be disturbed, but the
peace which comes by righteousness
will be its own guarantee of completeness
and continuity. 6.&nbsp;All these
blissful anticipations should constrain
towards present obedience, and be
fruitful of present joy. So the prophet
thought when he exclaimed, O house
<span class="pagenum" id="p72">[p.&nbsp;72]</span>
of Jacob, come ye, &amp;c. Those who have
great prospects should even now show
themselves to be the heirs of glory.
Christian joy is not all future. Even
now, though we have to complain of so
much of cloud and storm, there is a
light that is distinctively divine, and
under its benign rays we ought to walk
until the fuller glory is revealed.&mdash;<i>Joseph Parker, D.D.</i></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 class="tdc" id="o49"><span class="smcap">The Latter-Day Glory.</span></h3>

<p class="bq">ii.&nbsp;2&ndash;5. <i>And it shall come to pass in the last days, &amp;c.</i></p>

<p>Theme: <i>The Glory of the Latter Days.</i>
&ldquo;The last days,&rdquo; when men shall no
longer need to offer the prayer, &ldquo;Thy
kingdom <i>come.</i>&rdquo; The glory of the latter
days will consist&mdash;<b>I.&nbsp;In the exaltation
of the Lord&rsquo;s house above all other institutions</b>
(ver. 2). Now the Exchange,
the Senate, the University, &amp;c., are the
great &ldquo;mountains&rdquo; of society; then the
sanctuary will be supreme. In other
words, religion will be the ruling force
in society, dominating and directing all
the others. This is the truth set forth
by the figure of the upraising of Mount
Zion above all the other mountains,
&ldquo;so as to be visible in all directions.&rdquo;
<b>II.&nbsp;In universal submission to the
authority of God</b> (ver. 3). Not by the
Jews only (as in Isaiah&rsquo;s time), but by
&ldquo;<i>all</i> <span class="wsnw">nations,&rdquo;<a id="o49_fna1" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#o49_fn1">[1]</a></span>
and not (as now) by
some individuals merely, but by &ldquo;all
<i>nations,</i>&rdquo; will this authority be recognised
and obeyed. Sin will be the exception,
righteousness the rule. And so, as
a consequence of this&mdash;<b>III.&nbsp;In universal
peace among men</b> (ver. <span class="wsnw">4).<a id="o49_fna2" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#o49_fn2">[2]</a></span>
All contentions necessarily cease when men
know and do the will of God. James
iii.&nbsp;14&mdash;iv.&nbsp;1. Love towards man always
results from genuine love toward God.</p>

<p>A contemplation of their glorious
future is calculated&mdash;1.&nbsp;<i>To sustain us amid
the sins and sorrows of our time.</i> When
we look at the condition of the world
as it is, we are tempted to despair. But
there is a better day to come. In the
widening diffusion of Christian truth,
and in the growing power of Christian
principle, even now we may see at least
streaks of light which tell that the dawn
is near. 2.&nbsp;<i>To animate us in our efforts
to regenerate society.</i> These efforts are
not in vain, though they sometimes
seem so. We are working in the line
of victory (1&nbsp;Cor. xv.&nbsp;58). 3.&nbsp;<i>The
blessing of the future we can make our
own now.</i> &ldquo;O house of Jacob, come <i>ye,</i>
and let <i>us</i> walk in the light of the Lord,&rdquo;
that is, &ldquo;in His paths&rdquo; (ver. 3). We
can make religion the supreme force of
our life, and can act with a constant
recognition of God&rsquo;s authority; and
doing this, <i>we</i> shall have peace&mdash;with
God, with ourselves, and in our homes
(Isa. xxxii.&nbsp;17, 18).</p>

What words are these! What ideas!
What radiances of glory and hope for the long-afflicted
Church! Nations abolishing war and
crimes, to cultivate righteousness and peace!
nations emerging from ignorance and idolatry,
to join themselves to the Church, and to
walk in the light of the Lord! <i>How marvellous
that words like these should proceed from
the Hebrew prophets!</i> that men of the most
confined education with regard to the Gentiles
should thus lose the glory of Israel in the
overflowing glory of the converted world!
Can we ask for clearer proof that these holy
men were purely the organs of the Holy Ghost,
and transported in spirit to publish the
righteousness of God to every nation and language
of the earth?&mdash;<i>Sutcliffe.</i></p>

<p>I would urge the thoughtful consideration
of these verses (2&ndash;9) on any one who is perplexed
by the confident assertion of writers
who prefer vague declamation to close investigation
and reasoning, that the Hebrew prophets
were actuated by a bitter hatred of
foreigners. He will, I think, discover (from
this and such like study) that they were possessed
by views and hopes of a philanthropy
which even our own times have not been able
to extend: they longed for fellowship with all
men, under the only conditions in which
fellowship is possible; they desired an universal
communion of virtue, humanity, and
goodness, and could not be content to have a
general license of vice, brutality, and wickedness
instead; and they advocated what they
saw, and what all history has proved, to be the
only way of avoiding the one and securing the
other.&mdash;<i>Strachey.</i></p></div>

of the globe.</b> The vast political changes
that have taken place during the last
four centuries in Europe, Asia, Africa,
and America have all been favourable
to the extension of Christianity. The
area of Christian knowledge and influence
has been steadily <span class="wsnw">extending.<a id="o50_fna1" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#o50_fn1">[1]</a></span>
<b>II.&nbsp;The progress of civilisation and of
the arts.</b> A few years ago it required
the painful labour of years to copy a
Bible, and the wealth of a prince to
purchase one: now the art of printing
scatters the Word of God like autumn
leaves, and it is found in the humblest
dwelling. Then none could read but
the learned few; now knowledge is
becoming like sunlight, everywhere
diffused. War has long been one of
the greatest obstacles in the way of
human improvement; now various
causes are operating to render it less
frequent, such as 1.&nbsp;the rapid extension
of piety, carrying with it the
principles of peace; 2.&nbsp;the extension
of enlightened views of national policy;
3.&nbsp;the transference of power from kings
and nobles to the people, the victims
of war, who will become its powerful
opponents; 4.&nbsp;the invention of terrible
engines of destruction, which will tend
to deter nations from plunging into
war. Slavery, too, is rapidly disappearing
from the earth. The wonderful
facilities of intercommunication
which now exist are weakening and
effacing national prejudices. All these
causes are hastening on the promised
millennium. <b>III.&nbsp;The present state of
the sciences.</b> This statement seems
to be contradicted by the attitude of
many students of science towards
Christianity. But we must remember
that all the sciences in their infancy
have been arrayed as hostile to
scriptural truth&mdash;astronomy, geology,
physiology, chronology; but one by
one each of these sciences, as it
developed and attained maturity, has
passed over to the side of Christianity,
and has powerfully helped to build
up what it feebly and impotently
laboured to destroy. That which hath
been is that which shall be. In science
the cause of revealed truth will continue
to find one of her most ready
and efficient helpers. <b>IV.&nbsp;The past
achievements of Christianity foreshadow
its eventual and perfect
triumph.</b> The hostility of earth has
marshalled every possible power, in
every possible combination, against
Christianity&mdash;the persecution of political
power, the arguments of philosophy,
satire, learning, poetry, wealth&mdash;and
all in vain. The past triumphs
of the religion of Christ show that it
possesses an inherent energy which
must inevitably make it triumphant
over the world. The mighty influence
which swept away the gods of Greece
and Rome will not be baffled by the
mud-idols of India. <b>V.&nbsp;The triumphant
advances Christianity is now
making indicate its universal extension.</b>
<i>Application.</i>&mdash;What are <i>you</i> doing

All the might of the world is now on
the side of Christianity. Those barbarous,
inchoate powers which still cling to heathenism
are already trembling before the advancing
strides of the Christian nations; Christian
just enough to rouse all their energies and to
make them intensely ambitious, and on the
alert to increase their own dominion, without
having learned Christianity&rsquo;s highest lesson,
the lesson of love.</p>

<p>Even that heathenism which seems to have
some power is only waiting for its time of
decay. In vast, undisturbed forests, whose
interlacing branches exclude the light, moisture
<span class="pagenum" id="p74">[p.&nbsp;74]</span>
is generated, and rills, fed by marshes and
quiet pools, united to form running rivers.
But let the trees be cut down, and the ground
be laid open to the sun, and the swamps will
dry up, and the rivers run no more. So is it
with the Brahmins, and all the effete teachers
of heathenism. As long as the dense shadows
of ignorance brood over the people, they will
possess some little trickling power; but let

Men who seek God by reason and natural
strength (though we do not deny common
notions and general impressions of a sovereign
power) are like mariners who voyaged before
the invention of the compass, who were but
coasters, and unwillingly left the sight of the
land. Such are they who would arrive at God
by this world, and contemplate Him only in
His creatures and seeming demonstration.
Certainly every creature shows God, as a glass;
but glimmeringly and transitorily, by the frailty
both of the receiver and beholder; ourselves
have His image, as medals, permanently and
preciously delivered. But by these meditations
we get no further than to know what He doth,
not what He is.&mdash;<i>Donne,</i> 1573&ndash;1631.</p>

<p>None but the true God can discover [make
known] what the true worship of God is. As
that glorious eye of heaven is not to be seen
but by its own proper light,&mdash;a million of
torches cannot show us the sun: so it is not
all the natural reason in the world that can
either discover what God is, or what worship
He expects, without Divine and supernatural
revelation from Himself.&mdash;<i>Arrowsmith,</i> 1602&ndash;1659.</p></div>

Reason sees that man is ignorant, guilty,
mortal, miserable, transported with vain passions,
tormented with accusations of conscience,
but it could not redress those evils. Corrupt
nature is like an imperfect building that lies
in rubbish: the imperfection is visible but not
the way to finish it; for through ignorance of
the first design every one follows his own fancy,
whereas, when the Architect comes to finish
His own project, it appears regular and beautiful.
Thus the various directions of philosophers
to recover fallen man out of his ruins, and to
raise him to his first state, were vain. Some
glimmerings they had that the happiness of
a reasonable nature consisted in its union with
God, but in order to this they propounded such
means as were not only ineffectual, but opposite.
Such is the pride and folly of carnal wisdom,
that to bring God and man together, it advances
man, but depresses God.&mdash;<i>Bates,</i> 1625&ndash;1699.</p>

<p>All the days of sinful nature are dark night,
in which there is no right discerning of spiritual
things: some light there is, of reason, to
direct natural and civil actions, but no daylight.
Till the sun rise it is night still, for all the stars,
and the moon to help them.&mdash;<i>Leighton,</i> 1611&ndash;1684.</p></div>

It is a peculiar advantage of piety, that
it furnisheth employment fit for us, worthy of
us, hugely grateful, and highly beneficial to
us. Man is a very busy and active creature,
which cannot live and do nothing, whose
thoughts are in restless motion, whose desires
are ever stretching at somewhat, who perpetually
will be working either good or evil to
himself: wherefore greatly profitable must that
<span class="pagenum" id="p75">[p.&nbsp;75]</span>
thing be which determineth him to act well,
to spend his care and pain on that which is
truly advantageous to him; and that is religion
only. It alone fasteneth our thoughts, affections,
and endeavours upon occupations worthy
the dignity of our nature, suiting the excellence
of our natural capacities and endowments, tending
to the perfection and advancement of our
reason, to the enriching and ennobling of our
souls. Secluding that, we have nothing in the
world to study, to affect, to pursue, not very
mean and below us, not very base and unbecoming
us, as men of reason and judgment.
What have we to do but to eat and drink, like
horses or like swine; but to sport and play, like
children or apes; but to bicker and scuffle
about trifles and impertinencies, like idiots?
What but to scrape or scramble for useless pelf,
to hunt after empty shows and shadows of
honour, or the vain fancies or dreams of men?
What but to wallow or bask in sordid pleasures,
the which soon degenerate into remorse and
bitterness? To which sort of employments
were a man confined, what a pitiful thing he
would be, and how inconsiderable would be his
life! Were a man designed only, like a fly, to
buzz about here for a time, sucking in the air
and licking the dew, then soon to vanish back
into nothing, or to be transformed into worms,
how sorry and despicable a thing were he!
And such without religion we should be. But
it supplieth us with business of a most worthy
nature and lofty importance; it setteth us
upon doing things great and noble as can be;
it engageth us to free our minds from all fond
conceits, and cleans our hearts from all corrupt
affections,&mdash;to conform the dispositions
of our soul and the actions of our life to the
eternal laws of righteousness and goodness: it
putteth us upon the imitation of God, upon
obtaining a friendship and maintaining a correspondence
with the High and Holy One, upon
filling our minds for conversation and society
with the wisest and purest spirits above, upon
providing for our immortal state, upon the
acquist of joy and glory everlasting. It employeth
us in the divinest actions&mdash;promoting
virtue, performing beneficence, serving the
public, and doing good to all: the being exercised
in which things doth indeed render a man
highly considerable and his life excellently
valuable.&mdash;<i>Barrow,</i> 1630&ndash;1677.</p></div>

<h3 class="tdc" id="o52"><span class="smcap">The Walk of the Soul in the Light of the Lord.</span></h3>

<p class="bq">ii.&nbsp;5. <i>O house of Jacob, come ye, and let us walk in the light of the Lord.</i></p>

<p>There are many lights shining upon
the paths of men in this world. There
are the lights of science and philosophy;
they beam out from the human mind,
and are kindled by eager research and
investigation. These have been advancing
in splendour and in value, age
by age, and will, no doubt, continue to
do so to the end of time. Men walk in
these lights, and vainly imagine that
they have found the sun of the soul.
They seek no higher illumination.
They are mistaken. The lights of
science are but little service to the
moral nature; they cannot chase away
its darkness, or open up to it a vision
of destiny. The True Light cometh
down from above, and is Divine in its
origin. It is bright. It is beauteous.
It is sufficient for the guidance of the
soul. Wise men will walk in it. &ldquo;O
house of Jacob,&rdquo; &amp;c.</p>

<p><b>I. The walk of the soul.</b> &ldquo;Let us
walk.&rdquo; 1.&nbsp;<i>The moral walk of the soul is
a necessity.</i> The soul of man is endowed
with certain convictions and activities
which render inaction an impossibility.
It must walk either in one direction or
another; either toward moral purity
or moral evil; either to Christ or to
Satan. The moral sensibilities with
which it is gifted, the laws under which
it is placed, the influences to which it
is subject and the prospects that are
stretched out before the soul, render
moral progress a necessity of being.
2.&nbsp;<i>The moral walk of the soul is educational.</i>
Men gain knowledge in this
world by travel. In this way they
augment their mental stores. And
the soul gains knowledge, strengthens
its capabilities, and deepens its experience,
by walking forth into the great
moral universe in which it lives. Only
the souls that have walked in the paths
of truth and life know what things are,
and they only are able to guide others.
3.&nbsp;<i>The moral walk of the soul is healthful.</i>
Those who are inactive are always physically
weak. The soul that never takes
moral exercise, that never gets out into
the broad acres of truth, and that never
climbs the great mountains of God, will
ever be sickly. If the soul is to be
strong, equal to the duties of life, and
to the demands of being, it must not
<span class="pagenum" id="p76">[p.&nbsp;76]</span>
indolently repose in its own quiet hiding-place.
It must go forth to meet the
External. 4.&nbsp;<i>The moral walk of the soul
is often perilous.</i> The traveller has often
to walk through dark places, along difficult
paths, and near the deep precipice.
He is in a strange country. And so in
the walk of the soul. It is in a land
of which it knows but little. It has
to pass through the dark mystery of
truth, to traverse the windings of intricate
problems, and to find its way,
through perplexing circumstances, to
the throne of God.</p>

<p><b>II. The light of the Lord.</b> &ldquo;In the
light of the Lord.&rdquo; The soul of man
was not constituted to walk in darkness.
It was created with keen moral vision;
but, alas! its eye is dimmed by sin, and
is but seldom open to the light of heaven.
1.&nbsp;<i>This light is Divine in its origin.</i> It
does not come from the orb in the
heavens. It comes from beyond the
clouds&mdash;from the Sun of Righteousness,
whose rays are never lost in night. It
is not the light of the finite, but of the
Infinite. It is perennial and pure. It
is unparalleled in beauty. It is unique
in lustre. It is life-giving in its influence.
The soul can walk in no better
radiance. 2.&nbsp;<i>This light is clear in its
revelation.</i> But for the sun we should
know nothing of this world. And but
for the light of the Lord we should be
entirely ignorant of the moral world,
in which the soul lives and has its being.
This light which shines for the Spirit
of God from the Bible, and from the
enlightened conscience, reveals the
existence of God, the spirituality of His
nature, the purity of His character, and
the devotion of which He is worthy.
It reveals the soul to itself, and bends
it in humility, but in joy, as it unfolds
the forgiving mercy of the Cross. But
for this light of the Lord we should be
ignorant of the things of the moral
universe. It illuminates the soul in its
walk to the great and unknown future.
3.&nbsp;<i>This light is cheering in its influence.</i>
The light of the sun is cheering to man,
and is ever welcome to him. So the
light of the Lord is cheering to the pure
soul; it enlivens its energies, and lends
new beauty to its visions. 4.&nbsp;<i>This light
is abiding in its duration.</i> The light of
the Lord will never go down from the
pure soul, but will only brighten through
death into the perfect day.&mdash;By what
light do we walk? &ldquo;Come ye,&rdquo; now,
gladly, devoutly, &ldquo;and let us walk in
the light of the Lord.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>J.&nbsp;S. Exell.</i></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 class="tdc" id="o53"><span class="smcap">A Terrible Picture.</span></h3>

<p class="bq">ii.&nbsp;6&ndash;22.</p>

<p><i>Here</i> is a &ldquo;word&rdquo; (vision) which
Isaiah &ldquo;saw concerning Judah and
Jerusalem&rdquo; (ver. 1). The prophet has
been enraptured by the wondrous prospect
of the distant future, when religion
shall be the supreme force of life (ver. 2),
and all men (vers. 2, 3), walking in &ldquo;the
light of the Lord,&rdquo; shall be at peace with
each other (ver. 4): now he looks down
to the present, and how dark and terrible
is the picture which he sees before
him! He sees&mdash;<b>I.&nbsp;A nation forsaken of
God</b> (ver. 6). One of the most awful of
all spectacles: an engine of tremendous
power, without a driver, rushing down
a steep incline! <b>II.&nbsp;A nation pursuing
childish superstitions</b> (ver. 6): &ldquo;They
be replenished from the east, and are
soothsayers like the Philistines.&rdquo; When
a nation forsakes God, this is a common
result (Rom. i.&nbsp;21, 22). Witness the
rapid spread in our own day of &ldquo;spiritualism&rdquo;
among the sceptical and irreligious
classes of England and America.
<b>III.&nbsp;A nation seeking strength and
safety in alliances with the enemies
of God,</b> allying itself with the very
powers which Omnipotent Righteousness
was pledged to crush! Instead
of dwelling apart, as God intended
(Num. xxiii.&nbsp;9; Deut. xxxiii.&nbsp;28, &amp;c.),
and in dependence upon His protection,
the Israelites sought to strengthen themselves
by alliances with surrounding
nations. &ldquo;They please themselves
with the children of strangers.&rdquo; The
<span class="pagenum" id="p77">[p.&nbsp;77]</span>
same sin is repeated in these days, when
God&rsquo;s people mix with worldly society
for the sake of its &ldquo;advantages.&rdquo; <b>IV.&nbsp;A
nation blinded by external prosperity
to its real condition and peril</b>
(ver. 7). Abounding with every evidence
of prosperity, how could they
suspect that they were forsaken of God,
and that a terrible doom was hanging
over them? What is our condition,
and what are our prospects as a nation?
Let us not lay too much stress upon
our great national wealth. <b>V.&nbsp;A nation
given over to a debasing idolatry</b> (ver.
8; Rom. i.&nbsp;23). A moral degradation
extending to all classes (ver. 9). Just
what we behold in Roman Catholic and
ritualistic churches, where rich and
poor alike prostrate themselves before
the wheaten wafer which their priest
has transformed into a god! The prophet
himself now becomes part of the
picture, and we have&mdash;<b>VI.</b>&nbsp;The awful
spectacle of <b>a good man invoking the
vengeance of Heaven upon the nation
to which he belongs</b> (ver. 10): &ldquo;Therefore
forgive them not.&rdquo; This was the
natural cry of the prophet&rsquo;s soul, filled
with horror and indignation at what he
saw. The imprecations of Scripture
are the natural (and fitting) utterance
of righteousness in view of wickedness.
It is only because of the tone of our own
spiritual life is so low that we are
offended at them. From whom, among
ourselves, does the cry of human law against
the perpetrators of crimes of violence
come? Not from the classes most
likely to suffer for them, but from
the refined and gentle, who, just because
of their refinement and gentleness,
are inspired by them with disgust and
anger. So it is those who are most in
sympathy with God who are most
likely to burn with holy indignation
against such things as the prophet saw.
The men who offer such prayers as this,
&ldquo;Forgive them not,&rdquo; would be the first
to reverse it did the offenders give any
sign of repentance. <b>VII.&nbsp;A crushing
doom impending over an unsuspecting
nation.</b> No sooner had the prophet
uttered his prayer, than he sees it was
needless, and that the thunderclouds
of the Divine anger were already thickly
massed over the guilty nation; without
any visible sign there was gathering
over them a storm that would suddenly
break forth with destructive force.
Therefore he breaks out into a strain
of impassioned warning and appeal to
the very men for whose punishment he
had prayed (ver. 10, &amp;c.)</p>

<p>What lessons shall we learn from our
survey of this dark picture? 1.&nbsp;<i>Not
to judge of the relations of nations, individuals,
or ourselves to God by the test of
temporal circumstances.</i> It is an old
but gross fallacy that temporal prosperity
is a sure sign of the Divine
favour (Eccles. ix.&nbsp;1&ndash;3; Job xxi.&nbsp;7&ndash;15,
<span class="wsnw">&amp;c.)<a id="o53_fna1" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#o53_fn1">[1]</a></span>
Let us not ask what our circumstances
are, but what our character
is, and what our conduct has been. If
we are unrighteous, temporal prosperity
should alarm us, as a sign that God
has forsaken us (Heb. xii.&nbsp;8). 2.&nbsp;<i>Not
to be hasty to impute the temporal prosperity
of the wicked to a slumbering of the Divine
justice.</i> We need scarcely trouble ourselves
to pray for a doom upon the
ungodly (Exod. xxxiv.&nbsp;7; 2&nbsp;Pet. ii.&nbsp;3;
Job xxi.&nbsp;17, 18; Ps. lxxiii.&nbsp;18, 19;
Isa. iii.&nbsp;11). 3.&nbsp;<i>Let us remember that
we ourselves, as sinners, are exposed to the
Divine judgments, and let us &ldquo;enter into
the Rock&rdquo;</i>&mdash;&ldquo;the Rock of Ages,&rdquo; that,
sheltered in Him, we may be safe when
the storms of the final judgment shall
burst upon our guilty world.</p>

<h3 class="tdc" id="o54"><span class="smcap">God&rsquo;s People Forsaken.</span></h3>

<p class="bq">Heb. xiii.&nbsp;5. <i>I will never leave thee nor forsake thee.</i><br />
Isa. ii.&nbsp;6. <i>Thou hast forsaken Thy people the house of Jacob.</i></p>

<p>How comforting is the Apostle&rsquo;s
assurance! But do not the hope and
courage which it inspires die out of us,
and testify, &ldquo;Thou hast forsaken Thy
people&rdquo;? No! because before there is
any light concerning this question in
our understanding, our faith tells us
there must be a way of harmonising
these seemingly conflicting declarations.
God must necessarily be faithful
to His promise. &ldquo;I will never
leave thee nor forsake thee.&rdquo; Were
God to forsake any of His believing,
expecting people, He would do more
than forsake them&mdash;He would forsake
<i>Himself!</i> He would put off His crown
and lay aside His sceptre, and become
one of ourselves. Then the whole
universe would have cause to mourn in
sackcloth and ashes; there would no
longer be any <span class="smcap">God</span> to whom we could
make supplication in our sorrows.</p>

<p><b>I. The first of these inspired declarations
make it plain that God has a
people who He will never forsake.</b>
In every distress and tribulation He
will be with them. Though all other
friends may fail them, God will continue
faithful to them. When the
most devoted of human friends <i>could</i>
not be of any avail, God will be their
succour&mdash;when bereavement has broken
their heart; when persecution or
temptations are threatening to sweep
them away; in the hour of death.</p>

<p><b>II. The second of these inspired
declarations makes it plain that those
who have been accounted the people
of God may be forsaken by Him.</b> This
is a declaration that would smite us
with dismay, and plunge us into saddest
confusion, were we to put a full stop
where the prophet has put a comma.
Why had God forsaken His people,
the house of Jacob? Because they had
first forsaken Him: they had first
voluntarily ceased to be His people.
The truth in this matter may perhaps
be best apprehended by means of a
Scriptural symbol. God compares the
union that exists between Him and His
people to that which exists between a
man and his wife. Will a good husband
ever forsake his faithful wife? The
bloom and beauty of her youth may
have gone; a wasting sickness may
have rendered her positively unlovely,
but will he forsake her? Never! Her
misfortunes will only cause him to
cherish her with a tenderer love. But
if she be unfaithful to him, what then?
Why, then, the whole case may be
altered. If he be a merciful as well as
a just man, he may seek to reclaim
her; but if she be &ldquo;joined to her
lovers,&rdquo; and persistently heedless of all
his claims and her duties, the time will
come when he will leave her to her fate.
To him she will be as if she were dead.
So God is wondrous in His forbearance
towards His backsliding people; but
if they persist in their apostacy, He
will leave them to the gods whom they
have chosen (Judges x.&nbsp;13, 14; Jer. ii.&nbsp;28).
We see now that between these
apostolic and prophetic utterances there
is the most perfect harmony. Our discussion
of this subject should teach us&mdash;1.&nbsp;<i>Not
to found conclusions upon fragments
of God&rsquo;s sayings or doings.</i> His
words and His works are mutually
explanatory; but we must not cut the
explanations short! If we put periods
where God has only put commas, we
shall be plunged into frightful perplexities;
with the words of Scripture
on our lips, we shall have most
damnable heresies in our hearts. Our
study of God&rsquo;s word must be comprehensive.
So also must our study of
God&rsquo;s providence. Let us not be in a
hurry to come to conclusions. Wait,
and we shall have more light, because
we shall not be looking at parts, but
at wholes. Our life is being written in
clauses, and not till the last is completed
shall we be able to interpret the
first <span class="wsnw">aright.<a id="o54_fna1" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#o54_fn1">[1]</a></span>
2.&nbsp;<i>Not to build too much
upon past submissions to the Divine will
and past enjoyments of the Divine favour.</i>
&ldquo;Once in grace always in grace&rdquo; is an
<span class="pagenum" id="p79">[p.&nbsp;79]</span>
<span class="la">ignis fatuus</span> which has lighted many a
soul down to hell. If after being fenced
around as a garden of the Lord, and
tilled by the great Husbandman, and
watered by dews and rains from heaven,
we relapse into mere desert ground, we
may be sure we are nigh unto cursing
(Heb. vi.&nbsp;4&ndash;8). 3.&nbsp;<i>That those who are
humbly and loyally faithful to their
Heavenly Friend cannot be too confident
of His faithfulness to them.</i> Assuredly
He will never forsake them (Isa. xliii.&nbsp;2).
And His presence is all they need.
Having Him they have all things (Ps.
lxxxiv.&nbsp;11, 12).</p>

The Lord has reasons far beyond our
ken for opening a wide door, while He stops
the mouth of a useful preacher. John Bunyan
would not have done half the good he did, if
he had remained preaching in Bedford, instead
of being shut up in Bedford prison.&mdash;<i>Newton,</i>
1725&ndash;1807.</p>

<p>However contradictory the designs of Providence
at first appear to be, if we set ourselves
to watch God in His works and ways, with care,
we shall soon discover that He acts according
to some certain scheme or plan.</p>

<p>Were a person altogether unacquainted with
architecture to visit some splendid temple in
the process of erection, and observe the huge
rough stones, and boards and timbers, iron
castings, bricks, lime, mortar, lying scattered
in confusion all around; were he to see one
group of workmen cutting up material here,
another digging trenches there; one party
raising a staging on this side, another nailing
on some boards on that: were he to observe
the blocks, the fragments, all lying in disorder
round about him, he might truly say that he
could see no plan or system in the business;
nor would he be likely to conceive or dream
that out of such a chaotic mass of raw material,
out of such contradictory labour, there could
ever rise a magnificent temple, to reflect undying
honour on the architect, and beautify the
world!</p>

<p>But let the observer stop, and set himself to
watch from day to day this busy work as it goes
on; let him patiently examine, not only the
minutest details, but also try to obtain a view
of the general scope and bearing of the whole,
and he will not be long in finding out that
some superior mind controls and regulates the
movements in accordance with some preconceived
plan or system, which is constantly
developing itself; and that every stroke of
every workman is conducive to the same ultimate
effort.</p>

<p>And when he comes to see the &ldquo;beau ideal&rdquo;
of the builder realised in the fair proportions,
in the classic beauty of the noble structure, he
then perceives how inconsiderate, how unfair
it was in him to decide upon a work in its incipient
state, without some knowledge of the
plan and the design of it.</p>

<p>God is building up the Christian in accordance
with a perfect plan into a majestic temple
for the decoration of the eternal city. And
though His dealings sometimes seem to be
mysterious; though He seems to cut down
here and to raise up there, to let the light into
this part and to leave it dark in that; though
it is hard to tell at times what such material
is designed for, what this or that work means,
or to conceive how the structure when completed
will appear; it is nevertheless quite
certain that God acts according to a fixed and
unalterable plan; that every stroke we bear,
or loss we mourn, is made subservient to the
end; and although it is given us here to see
only in part, whoever will take the pains to
watch with care the course of Providence, will
be convinced that it does not move along by
chance, but that everything is done by a prospective
plan.&mdash;<i>E. Nason.</i></p></div>

are forsaken of God.</b> This doom
befalls them&mdash;1.&nbsp;when they are left
without that aid of the Holy Spirit,
without which they cannot vividly
apprehend the truth; 2.&nbsp;when they
are left without the comfort of God&rsquo;s
mercy; 3.&nbsp;when they are left without
earnest distress after God, and consequently
a prey to all the evil within
and around them. <b>III.&nbsp;Men may be
forsaken of God in the midst of temporal
prosperity.</b> There may be a
terrible contrast between their spiritual
and material condition (ver. 6, 7).
Temporal prosperity is from God; it
<span class="pagenum" id="p80">[p.&nbsp;80]</span>
is designed to lead men to repentance
(Rom. ii.&nbsp;4); failing to accomplish this,
it drives them further from God (Deut.
viii.&nbsp;11&ndash;14; Prov. xxx.&nbsp;9; Neh. ix.&nbsp;25);
and when it has this effect upon
them, the doom of which our text
speaks to us is not far off
(Deut. <span class="wsnw">xxviii. 48).<a id="o55_fna2" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#o55_fn2">[2]</a></span>
<b>IV.&nbsp;No man need remain
thus forsaken of God.</b> 1.&nbsp;God desires
to bring all men into fellowship
with Himself (ver. 3, 4). 2.&nbsp;All are invited
to come to Him (ver. 5). 3.&nbsp;The light
of God&rsquo;s countenance is offered them,
especially in Christ, who is &ldquo;the light
of the world.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>John Johnston.</i></p>

In common conversation, we frequently
speak of solar eclipses. But what is called
an eclipse of the sun is, in fact, an eclipse
of the earth, occasioned by the moon&rsquo;s transit
between the sun and us. This circumstance
makes no alteration in the sun itself, but only
intercepts our view of it for a time. From
whence does darkness of soul, even darkness
that may be felt, usually originate? Never
from any changeableness in our covenant
God, the glory of whose unvarying faithfulness
and love shines the same, and can suffer
no eclipse. It is when the world gets between
our Lord and us, that the light of His countenance
is obstructed, and our rejoicing in Him
suffers a temporary eclipse.&mdash;<i>Salter.</i></p></div>

When the king removes, the court and
all the carriages follow after, and when they
are gone, the hangings are taken down;
nothing is left behind but bare walls, dust,
and rubbish. So, if God removes from a man
or a nation, where He kept His court, His
graces will not stay behind; and if they be
gone, farewell peace, farewell comfort: down
goes the hangings of all prosperity; nothing
is left behind but confusion and disorder.&mdash;<i>Staughton,</i> 1628.</p></div>

<h3 class="tdc" id="o56"><span class="smcap">The Material and the Moral.</span></h3>

<p class="bq">ii.&nbsp;6&ndash;9. <i>They be replenished from the east, &amp;c.</i></p>

<p>We have here the indictment which
the prophet brings against Israel. It
consists of three counts: 1.&nbsp;That the
people had adopted the superstitions
of the surrounding nations. 2.&nbsp;That
the government had accumulated treasure
and organized a cavalry force,
in direct disobedience to well-known
Divine injunctions (Deut. xvii.&nbsp;16, 17).
3.&nbsp;That rich and poor alike had
abandoned themselves to idolatry.
But these verses may be taken also as
Isaiah&rsquo;s <i>description</i> of Jud&aelig;a in his day;
and so regarding them, we find in
them an instructive combination of the
material and the moral. According to
modern ideas, so far as the description
concerns the material, it is exceedingly
bright. An observer who regarded
only the material&mdash;such a man as we
can conceive of as being sent out as a
&ldquo;Special Commissioner&rdquo; by the <i>Daily
Telegraph</i> or the <i>New York Herald</i>&mdash;would
have given a glowing account of
Jud&aelig;a at that period: an overflowing
exchequer, a powerful army, evidences
of wealth and prosperity on every hand,
&amp;c. But the prophet, looking only at
what is moral, gives an account that
is lurid and dark in the extreme: he
sees only cause for lamentation and
foreboding. So we reach the first of
the lessons on which I intend to insist
to-day, viz., <b>I.&nbsp;That the most diverse
reports may be made truly concerning
the same community.</b> St. Paul visited
Athens, and we have a touching account
of the effect of that city upon him
(Acts xvii.&nbsp;16); to him it presented a
pitiable spectacle; but what a different
effect would have been produced upon
a mere man of culture, and what a
different account he would have given
of that metropolis of art! What very
different accounts might be given of
our own country from these two standpoints,
the material and the moral!</p>

<p><b>II. When two reports of a community
are given&mdash;one materially
bright and the other morally dark&mdash;it
is the latter only that a wise man
will regard as important.</b> For 1.&nbsp;<i>It
is on the moral condition of a nation, and
not on its material prosperity, that its
happiness depends.</i> Increase of wealthy
does not necessarily mean increase of
happiness. Frequently it means destruction
of happiness; it always does
so, when wealth increases faster than
intellectual culture and moral restraint.
In the absence of this moral restraint,
wealth is not a blessing, but a curse.
<span class="pagenum" id="p81">[p.&nbsp;81]</span>
2.&nbsp;<i>The material disassociated from the
moral is transient.</i> Vicious prosperity
is short-lived. By the luxury born of
prosperity and virtue of industry, foresight,
and self-denial, on which prosperity
depends, are sapped. The health
of the nation is lowered. Commerce
becomes a gigantic system of gambling.
Ruin is soon reached. Hence,</p>

<p><b>III. Our chief concern as patriots
should be to promote the moral well-being
of our nation.</b> Those who uplift
it in virtue are its true benefactors.
All who minister to its material, intellectual,
and artistic progress are worthy
of gratitude; but most deserving of
gratitude are those who inspire it with
the fear of God, and with love for His
laws. Hence,</p>

<p><b>IV. Our chief concern as individuals
should be for the moral and not for the
material.</b> It is a very small matter
to add house to house, and field to
field: it is a very great thing to add
virtue to virtue until we have succeeded
in building up a symmetrical and noble
moral character. A man&rsquo;s life&mdash;his true
well-being depends not upon what he
<i>has,</i> but upon what he <span class="wsnw"><i>is</i>.<a id="o56_fna1" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#o56_fn1">[1]</a></span>
And upon this, too, depends his eternal destiny.
How childish, therefore, is the
almost universal concern for mere
material improvement! And how little
have those to complain of who find
themselves unable to accumulate wealth!
The millionaire has soon to leave all
his stores, and he speedily reaches a
point at which all his bonds and notes
become wastepaper. What a contrast
between his experience, and that of the
man who, having employed his life in
virtue, finds that all unconsciously he
has been laying all up for himself
treasures in heaven! These two courses
are open to us&mdash;to live for the material,
or to live for the moral: which will
you choose?</p>

A wise man looks upon men as he does

of title, wealth, and place, but as harness.&mdash;<i>Newton,</i> 1725&ndash;1807.</p>

<p>In the library of the world, men have
hitherto been ranged according to the form,
the size, and the binding. The time is coming
when they will take rank and order according
to their contents and intrinsic merits.&mdash;<i>E. Cook.</i></p>

<p>A man may be outwardly successful all his
life long, and die hollow and worthless as a
puff-ball; and a man may be externally
defeated all his life long, and die in the royalty
of a kingdom established within him. That
man is a pauper who has only outward success;
and that man may be a prince who dies in rags,
untended, and unknown in his physical relations
to this world. And we ought to take the
ideal in the beginning that a man&rsquo;s true estate
of power and riches is to be in himself: not
in his dwelling; not in his position; not in
his external relations, but in his own essential
character. That is the realm in which a man
must live, if he is to live as a Christian man.&mdash;<i>Beecher.</i></p></div>

<h3 class="tdc" id="o57"><span class="smcap">The Sinner&rsquo;s Danger and Refuge.</span></h3>

<p class="bq">ii.&nbsp;10. <i>Enter into the rock, and hide thee in the dust, for fear of the Lord, and for
the glory of His majesty.</i></p>

<p>This is the counsel which the
prophet gives his fellow-countrymen,
in view of the desolations which God
was about to send upon their land on
account of their sins. He sees God&rsquo;s
judgments sweeping down upon them
like an invading army, and therefore
he cries to them, &ldquo;Flee into the caverns
in the mountains:&rdquo; like the <i>Simoom,</i>
and therefore he cries to them, &ldquo;Hide
yourselves in the dust: bow down
before the destroying blast from which
it is impossible to escape. God has
been silent, as if He were indifferent
to your transgressions, but now He is
coming forth, in all the terrors of His
majesty to require the evil doers
according to their <span class="wsnw">works.&rdquo;<a id="o57_fna1" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#o57_fn1">[1]</a></span>
The counsel is, of course, metaphorical; the
rocks and the dust could afford no
refuge from an angry God. <i>The
summons is to profound and penitential
humility,</i> the proper attitude of man to
God. It is a summons, therefore,
which may be fitly addressed to all
men. <b>I.&nbsp;Profound humility in regard
to God would be befitting in us as creatures,
even were we absolutely without</b>
<span class="pagenum" id="p82">[p.&nbsp;82]</span>
<b>sin.</b> Such humility is reasonable&mdash;1.&nbsp;In
view of our relation to and
dependence upon God. He is our
Maker; we are daily pensioners on
His bounty; we are the instruments
with which He carries out His purposes
(ch. x.&nbsp;15). 2.&nbsp;In view of His position
as the Ruler of the universe. 3.&nbsp;In
view of the transcendent excellencies
of His character. The pupils of a great
artist, such as Raphael, the associates
of a great patriot, such as Washington,
are filled with involuntary admiration
and veneration for him. They feel
themselves to be as nothing in comparison
with him. How much more
should we feel so in comparison with
God! Those sinless being who see
Him as He is show us by their conduct
what would be befitting in us even
were we also without spot or stain
(ch. vi.&nbsp;2, 3). <b>II.&nbsp;But as sinners that
which is befitting in us is, not only
profound, but penitential humility.</b>
To live without any sense of guilt in
our hearts&mdash;with indifference to the
fact that we have broken God&rsquo;s laws
and are exposed to His judgements&mdash;is
itself a gross iniquity; it is an outrageous
defiance of the majesty in
whose presence we are. What would
be said of a rebel who in the presence
of his outraged sovereign should absolutely
<i>ignore</i> him? Would not this be
regarded as a repetition of his offence
in the most aggravated form? But is
not this precisely the offence which
every stout-hearted sinner daily commits?
As sinners there are two things
especially incumbent upon us. 1.&nbsp;<i>To
humbly acknowledge that we are exposed to
the Divine judgments, and need a refuge
therefrom.</i> There are two ways of contemplating
the Day of Judgment: (1)&nbsp;As
a certain and solemn fact in the
history of our race. Contemplating
it thus, we may show argumentatively
that such an event ought to occur;
and we may anticipate to some extent
the principles upon which the Judge,
when He shall have summoned mankind
before His bar, will proceed. We
may do this, and be merely theological
or rhetorical. Or (2)&nbsp;we may regard
it as a certain and terrible fact in our
<i>own</i> history. And it is thus that we
should regard it. It is <i>we</i> who are to
stand before the great White Throne.
A realisation of this fact will powerfully
affect our feelings and our conduct; we
shall (1)&nbsp;acknowledge, at the least, that
<i>we need a refuge.</i> And we shall be
prepared (2)&nbsp;<i>thankfully to avail ourselves
of the refuge which God in His mercy has
provided for us.</i> With yet greater fulness
and definiteness of meaning God&rsquo;s
messengers can repeat the prophet&rsquo;s
counsel, &ldquo;Enter into the rock, &amp;c.&rdquo;
The sinner&rsquo;s refuge is the Son of God,
&ldquo;the Rock of our salvation.&rdquo; Our
refuge from God as our Judge is God
Himself as our Saviour. It is as such
that He now reveals Himself to us.
&ldquo;Behold <i>now</i> is the day of salvation;&rdquo;
but the day of judgment is at hand!
Ere it burst upon us, let us flee unto
&ldquo;the Rock of Israel&rdquo; (ch. xxx.&nbsp;29)
crying to Him, with penitent confession
of our sins,</p>

<p class="bqpoemr">&ldquo;Rock of Ages, cleft for me,<br />
&nbsp;Let me hide myself in Thee.&rdquo;</p>

&ldquo;The iniquity of Ephraim is bound up,
their sin is hid&rdquo; (Hosea xiii.&nbsp;12). Not that
his sin was hid from God, but his sin is hid;
that is, it is recorded, it is laid up against a
day of reckoning. That this is the meaning,
is clear by the foregoing words, his iniquity
is bound up; as the clerk of the assizes binds
up the indictments of malefactors in a bundle,
and, at the assizes, brings out the indictments,
and reads them in court, so God binds up
men&rsquo;s sins in a bundle; and, at the day of
judgment, this bundle shall be opened, and
all their sins brought to light before men and
angels.&mdash;<i>Watson,</i> 1696.</p></div>

<h3 class="tdc" id="o58"><span class="smcap">The Great Dethronement.</span></h3>

<p class="bq">ii.&nbsp;18. <i>And the idols He shall utterly abolish.</i></p>

<p>There are a great number of things
which would be incredible if they had
not actually happened! Men who, like
ourselves, boasted of &ldquo;reason&rdquo; and
&ldquo;common sense,&rdquo; sought to settle their
disputes and to vindicate their honour
by the duel; they have stoutly believed
in witchcraft, in &ldquo;touching for the king&rsquo;s
<span class="pagenum" id="p83">[p.&nbsp;83]</span>
evil,&rdquo; and in other absurdities. But
surely the supreme folly of which men
have been guilty is idolatry. That men
should fashion an idol of wood or stone,
and then bow down to worship <i>it,</i> what
absurdity is this! Yet <b>I.&nbsp;The idols
have had a long reign in the earth.</b>
Trace human history back as far as all
extant records will enable you to do so,
and you will find idols enthroned in the
affections of men. That they should
ever have been set up there must be
regarded as one of Satan&rsquo;s subtlest and
greatest triumphs. The instincts that
lead men to worship are so strong, that
his only hope of preventing fallen men
from returning to their allegiance to
God lay in persuading them to worship
some other thing or being. His difficulty
and his device were those of
Jeroboam (1&nbsp;Kings xii.&nbsp;26&ndash;28). He
seems to have led men down step by
step: stars, images as representatives,
then the images themselves: first,
natural principles, then living creatures
in which these principles were supposed
to be embodied, then the living creatures
themselves. To have begun at
the end would have been too great a
shock; the absurdity as well as the
wickedness of such worship would have
been too obvious. Thus was the empire
of the idols founded, and it continues
to this day. <b>II.&nbsp;The empire of the
idols has been world-wide.</b> It might
have been supposed to be a folly that
could be imposed only on a few barbarous
tribes, and that all civilised
nations would have rejected it with
distain; but as a matter of fact, it is
precisely among these nations (Egypt,
Greece, Rome, Jud&aelig;a, India) that
idolatry flourished most and in its
basest forms. Hence the empire of
idolatry was co-extensive with the globe.
In Elijah&rsquo;s time even God thought it a
great thing that He would assure His
prophet that there were seven thousand
who had not bowed the knee to Baal
(1&nbsp;Kings xix.&nbsp;18). <b>III.&nbsp;The idols have
been served with passionate devotion.</b>
In almost all ages worshippers of idols
have put to shame the worshippers of
God, by their fidelity to their convictions,
the scrupulousness of their observance
of the rites which they have
esteemed religious, and the greatness
of the cost at which they have done
honour to their gods. <b>IV.&nbsp;The idols
have had for their allies the most influential
of social and moral forces.</b>
Their priests and dependents (Acts. xix.&nbsp;25)
have jealously watched every encroachment
on the empire of their gods.
Rulers, for political reasons, have strenuously
endeavoured to uphold the
national faiths. Custom and fashion
have wrought in the same direction.
But, above all, the idols have had their
most powerful allies in the human
breast&mdash;in the instinct of worship, and
the craving for sensual indulgences.
<i>Idolatry has combined these most powerful
of all cravings</i>&mdash;has provided deities in
whose worship the worst passions of
man&rsquo;s animal nature have been gratified.
<b>V.&nbsp;Nevertheless the empire of
idolatry shall be utterly destroyed.</b>
It shall vanish as utterly as the great
empire of Assyria. &ldquo;The idols He
shall utterly abolish.&rdquo; Already that
empire has been overthrown where it
seemed most firmly established, and the
complete fulfilment of the prediction of
our text is obviously now only a question
of time. Even in heathen countries,
men are becoming ashamed of their
idols, and are representing them as
merely the <i>media</i> of worship. The
victory of Christianity over idolatry is
already assured. The struggles that
are yet to shake the world will be, not
between Christianity and idolatry; not
even between Christianity and atheism,
for atheism is necessarily merely a brief
episode in human experience; but between
Christianity and other forms of
monotheism.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Application.</span> 1. <i>In the wide-spread
and long-continued empire of the idols we
have a conclusive proof of man&rsquo;s need of a
Divine revelation.</i> The natural progress
of fallen man is not to light, but to
darkness (Rom. i.&nbsp;21&ndash;23; 1&nbsp;Cor. i.&nbsp;21).
2.&nbsp;<i>In the prediction of our text, we have a
conclusive proof of that in the Bible we have
such a revelation.</i> Consider the circumstances
of the prophet: idolatry on
every hand, corrupting even His own
people. It was contrary to all experience;
<span class="pagenum" id="p84">[p.&nbsp;84]</span>
it must have seemed to many
who first heard it as the ravings of a
lunatic. Such a prediction, already so
marvellously fulfilled, came from God!
3.&nbsp;<i>In the approaching complete fulfilment
of the prediction of our text, let us rejoice.</i>
And let us labour as well as pray, that
the time may be hastened when by
idolatry God shall be no longer dishonoured
and man degraded.</p>

<p class="bq">ii.&nbsp;22. <i>Cease ye from man, whose breath is in his nostrils: for wherein is he to be
accounted of?</i></p>

<p>In this verse the whole Bible is
summed up. The folly of trusting in
man, and the necessity of trusting in
God alone, is its greatest lesson, from its
commencement to its close. This is
what we are taught&mdash;<b>I.&nbsp;By its record of
God&rsquo;s providential dealings with the
Jews and other nations.</b> Continually
He has accomplished His ends by very
different means than man would have
selected. Egypt saved from perishing
by famine through the instrumentality
of a young slave; Naaman delivered
from his leprosy through the ministrations
of a little maid; Israel rescued by
Gideon and his three hundred soldiers;
the boastful Philistines defeated by a
young shepherd, &amp;c. <b>II.&nbsp;By the grand
scheme of human redemption which it
discloses.</b> In it God is everything,
and man nothing. The only means by
which man can be restored to holiness,
to the Divine favour and life everlasting,
were provided by God; man contributed
nothing either to its completeness
or efficiency. The benefit is man&rsquo;s,
the glory all belongs to God. Nor in
appropriating it does he do anything
that is meritorious. In repentance there
is no merit: it is simply that state of
mind which is required of us in view of
the sins we have committed. Nor in
faith; it is simply the recognition of
the ability of another, and the consequent
entrustment of ourselves to Him,
to do that for us which we confess our
inability to do for ourselves.&mdash;Blessed
is the man, and he only, who has learned
these two things. So long as a man
depends on his own wisdom, power, and
goodness, or on the wisdom, power and
goodness of other men, he must be disquieted
and unhappy. We can attain
to substantial quiet and an abiding
satisfying peace only when we feel that
our dependence is on a Being omnipresent,
independent, and supreme, as well
as abundant in truth and love (Isa.
xxvi.&nbsp;3).&mdash;<i>Joseph Holdech, D.D., American

<p class="bq">ii.&nbsp;22. <i>Cease ye from man, whose breath is in his nostrils: for wherein is he to be
accounted of?</i></p>

<p>The event which has just befallen
us as a nation is fitted to teach&mdash;<b>I.&nbsp;The
vanity of human dependence.</b> The
atheism of the human heart displays
itself in a disposition to confide entirely
in an arm of flesh. This is so in the
family, the church, the nation. In
various ways God endeavours to teach
nations their real dependence upon
Himself&mdash;by famine, by pestilence, by
commercial disasters, by the death of
their rulers. What &ldquo;fools&rdquo; we must
be, and how &ldquo;brutish&rdquo; must be our
understanding, if we do not lay to
heart the lesson which He has now given
us (Ps. cxlvi.&nbsp;3). <b>II.&nbsp;The pettiness
of party strife.</b> How much of selfishness,
unkindness, anger, and untruthfulness
does the spirit of party give
birth to! How seldom politicians of
opposite parties do each other common
justice! How fierce are their
rivalries! But how mean, how worthless,
how unworthy appear the objects
of their strife when death enters the
arenas and waves his skeleton arm!
What a great calm falls upon the
agitated spirits of men! How noise
<span class="pagenum" id="p85">[p.&nbsp;85]</span>
is hushed and excitement subdued!
How like do the flushed and eager
politicians seem then to silly children
quarrelling for the possession of a
bubble that has just been blown into
the air, and that will disappear the
moment it is <span class="wsnw">grasped!<a id="o60_fna1" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#o60_fn1">[1]</a></span>
<b>III.&nbsp;The
vanity of the world, the certainty of
death, and the nearness of eternity.</b>
These lessons are <i>taught</i> when a beggar
dies, but are more likely to be <i>laid to
heart</i> when a prince is laid <span class="wsnw">low.<a id="o60_fna2" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#o60_fn2">[2]</a></span>
<b>IV.&nbsp;The supreme importance of a
right moral character.</b> Most instructive
is the interest felt by survivors in
the moral character of the departed,
in the evidences of his preparation for
death, in the manner in which the
great summons affected him. This is
the testimony of the human conscience,
that in comparison with a fitness to
appear before the tribunal of God,
everything else loses its importance.
When was the amount of a man&rsquo;s
<i>possessions</i> inscribed on his tombstone?
The bare suggestion of such
a thing would be construed as a
mockery of death, under whose denuding
hand the rich man leaves the world
naked as he entered it. But if, in all
his life, there was one virtue in his
moral character, one trait which can
afford satisfactory evidence of God&rsquo;s
approval, this, be sure, you will find
sculptured in conspicuous characters
on his monumental marble. One thing
alone can prepare any for their last
account&mdash;the belief and practice of
the Gospel of God. Have <i>you</i> the great
calm which is inspired by the confidence
of being prepared for the
great change?&mdash;<i>W. Adams, American

<h3 class="tdc" id="o61"><span class="smcap">The Death of Statesmen.</span></h3>

<p class="tdc">(<i>Funeral Sermon for the Right Hon. George Canning.</i>)</p>

<p class="bq">iii.&nbsp;1&ndash;3. <i>For, behold, the Lord, the Lord of hosts, doth take away from Jerusalem
and from Judah&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. the counsellor,&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and the eloquent orator.</i></p>

<p>By the death of a great statesman
at the head of a government, we are
reminded.&mdash;<b>I.</b>&nbsp;Of <b>the weight of government
in a fallen world.</b> It is a
burden that has crushed many, and has
brought them to an untimely grave. <b>II.</b>&nbsp;Of
<b>the weakness of the shoulders of
mortal men.</b> The government of a
single country, especially in troublous
times, has proved a burden too great
for the courage and the endurance of
the strongest of men. <b>III.</b>&nbsp;Of <b>the
uncertainty of all human affairs.</b>
Often does the statesman think of the
uncertainty of arriving at the object
of his ambition, but seldom of the
<span class="pagenum" id="p86">[p.&nbsp;86]</span>
uncertainty of his remaining there,
except when he recollects how many
are struggling to replace him. Little
does he think of another foe, who
lurks behind, and who in some unexpected
moment will hush his eloquent
tongue, and turn his fertile brain to
dust. <b>IV.</b>&nbsp;Of <b>our absolute dependence
on the Supreme Governor.</b> We are
apt to think that it is on the profound
counsellor and mighty orator that the
nation&rsquo;s welfare depends, and to think
little of Him who made them what
they are, to be employed as He pleases,
laid aside when He pleases, and replaced
if He pleases, by others as
richly endowed. <b>V.</b>&nbsp;Of <b>the necessity
of personal preparation for</b>
<span class="wsnw"><b>death.</b><a id="o61_fna1" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#o61_fn1">[1]</a></span>&mdash;<i>J. Bennett, D.D.,

<h3 class="tdc" id="o62"><span class="smcap">National Greatness.</span></h3>

<p class="bq">iii.&nbsp;1&ndash;8. <i>For, behold, &amp;c.</i></p>

<p><b>I. The elements of national greatness
are intellectual and moral, rather
than material.</b> A nation may have
&ldquo;the staff of bread&rdquo; and &ldquo;the stay of
water,&rdquo; but lacking the persons enumerated
in ver. 2, 3, it cannot be a great
nation. While, therefore, it is reasonable
to put forth efforts to increase the
material resources of the nation, we
should be more concerned to improve
the producers than the produce. <b>II.&nbsp;For
the supply and continuance of
these supreme elements of national
greatness, we are absolutely dependent
upon God.</b> Well to remember that
for all material blessings we are <i>absolutely</i>
dependent upon Him. The moral
value of a bad harvest is often great;
it reminds us that, do what the most
skilful agriculturists may, it is &ldquo;God
that giveth the increase.&rdquo; Nor less
dependent are we upon Him for the
<i>men</i> without whom no nation can be
great. Wise statesmen, skilful inventors,
eloquent orators, &amp;c., are very
special gifts of God; such men cannot
be manufactured. <b>III.&nbsp;These essential
elements of national greatness God
will take away for those nations
that are regardless of His goodness
and defiant of His authority</b> (ver.
1, 8). National sins bring on national
judgments. No national judgment
is more severe or prolific of disasters
than the removal or denial of great
leaders. <b>IV.&nbsp;Not only can God abase
the greatest nation, but He can
reduce it to the depths of humiliation
which beforehand it would have regarded
as inconceivable.</b> See through
what states of national sorrow and
shame the prophet declared that Israel
should be led. 1.&nbsp;The diminution of
its material resources and the removal
of all its leaders of society (ver. 1&ndash;3).
2.&nbsp;The government entrusted to weak
and childish rulers (ver. 4). 3.&nbsp;Social
anarchy (ver. 5). 4.&nbsp;Social degradation
so extreme, that men are solicited
to rule merely because they have a little
wealth (ver. 6). 5.&nbsp;The last state
of national degradation&mdash;its supreme
places of authority have become so
contemptible and perilous that no one
can be induced to fill them (ver. 7).</p>

<p>These considerations concern us individually.
The nation is but an aggregate
of individuals; and what they
are, it is. Hence it behoves us&mdash;1.&nbsp;<i>To
strive after personal holiness.</i> This seems
a very small remedy for national evils.
But it is only by each man adopting
it that the nation can be made religious.
If each <i>drop</i> in the ocean could eliminate
the salt with which it is charged, the
<i>ocean</i> would become fresh. Besides, by
our example we may stimulate others
to personal reforms, and they again
others. 2.&nbsp;<i>To entreat God to deal with
us as a nation in the way of mercy, and</i>
<span class="pagenum" id="p87">[p.&nbsp;87]</span>
<i>not of judgment</i> (Ps. ciii.&nbsp;10). There
is a mighty power in intercessory
prayer. 3.&nbsp;<i>Diligently to promote all
moral and social reforms.</i> We must
labour as well as pray. A Christian
man will assist in all political reforms,
because it is the will of God that
righteousness should prevail in all
things. But much more interested will
he be in all movements and institutions
having for their end and the intellectual
and moral advancement of the people:
the school, the temperance society,
better dwellings for the working
classes, the diffusion of a pure literature,
&amp;c. 4.&nbsp;<i>To put forth constant
efforts to bring and keep our fellow-countrymen
under the influence of the Gospel.</i>
Of all regenerative and conservative
influences the Gospel is the most
active and powerful. A nation composed
entirely of genuine Christians
would be at once the most happy,
prosperous, and powerful the world
has ever seen. The direct and short
way to exalt Great Britain is to
strive to lead all our countrymen to
the knowledge and service of Christ.
This is a work, not for ministers only,
but for the whole Church. There
would be more happy Christians if
there were more working Christians.
It is not the running brooks, but the
standing pools, that become stagnant.</p>

<h3 class="tdc" id="o63"><span class="smcap">Shameless Sinners.</span></h3>

<p class="bq">iii.&nbsp;9. <i>They declare their sin as Sodom, they hide it not.</i></p>

<p>Extremes are generally detestable:
equatorial heat, arctic cold; the speaker
whom we must strain to hear, the orator
who roars, &amp;c. So in morals: foolhardy
rashness, cowardice; prodigality, penuriousness;
hypocrites, and such shameless
sinners as are spoken of here. Such
persons are even more detestable than
hypocrites; these at least pay this
homage to virtue, that they array themselves
in her outer garments. Desperate
and vain is the endeavour to cloak
iniquity, yet even this is better than
the effrontery which leads some to flaunt
it in open day. How surprising is such
effrontery! When we consider what
sin is&mdash;a thing horribly degrading to
man as well as insufferably offensive to
God&mdash;we should have expected beforehand
that men would have been as
anxious to hide their vices, as they are
to conceal any loathsome disease with
which they may be afflicted. But it is
not so. There are tens of thousands of
sinners as devoid of shame as were those
who dwelt in Sodom; nay, they glory
in their shame. Consider&mdash;</p>

<p><b>I.</b> <span class="smcap">The Causes of Shamelessness
in Sin.</span></p>

<p><b>1. Ignorance.</b> There are many so uninterested
in moral and spiritual things;
they have grown up surrounded by such
evil examples, that they have no consciousness
of the foulness of their vices,
any more than a peasant has of the ungracefulness
of his manners. This cause
operates among the lower classes to an
extent scarcely conceivable by the cultured
and refined. <b>2.&nbsp;Habit.</b> Many an
open and shameless sinner, at the outset
of his career, when he was first betrayed
into transgression, was ashamed almost
to walk through the street, and imagined
that every one whom he met had heard
of, and despised him for, his offence.
But the offence was repeated; it became
a habit; and in proportion as it has done
so, has the offender&rsquo;s sense of shame died
out of him. He thinks as little of it
as a soldier does of his uniform, which
when it was first put on caused him to
think that all eyes were fixed upon him.
<b>3.&nbsp;A desire to silence conscience.</b> The
effrontery is often assumed, just as the
rustic traveller when near a churchyard
whistles, not because he is courageous,
but to keep his courage up. Conscience
reproaches and warns, and the sinner
seeks to silence it by greater desperation
in wickedness. <b>4.&nbsp;A seared conscience.</b>
In the course just named the
sinner too often succeeds. Conscience,
defied and outraged, desists from her
useless efforts, and gives herself over to
an insensible lethargy; there will come
an hour of terrible awakening; but
meanwhile she is blind, deaf, dumb,
and the sinner perpetrates the most
<span class="pagenum" id="p88">[p.&nbsp;88]</span>
abominable iniquities without a <span class="wsnw">blush.<a id="o63_fna1" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#o63_fn1">[1]</a></span>
<b>5.&nbsp;Infidelity.</b> The sinner has succeeded
at last in persuading himself
that what he wishes were true is true,
and that there is no God, and, consequently,
no day of judgment and no
hell. As soon as men have cast off fear
of God, it is easy for them to cast off
fear of men. The ordinary fruit of
infidelity is vice. What but prudence
is left to restrain the infidel from partaking
in the pleasures of sin? And
how weak prudence is in any real contest
with passion!</p>

<p><b>II.</b> <span class="smcap">The Consequences of Shamelessness
in Sin.</span></p>

<p>This is declared by the prophet to
be woe&mdash;woe of peculiar intensity and
awfulness. &ldquo;Woe unto their soul!&rdquo;
&amp;c. They stand in peril of the
severest chastisements of the Divine
justice&mdash;<b>1.&nbsp;Because shamelessness in
sin is an aggravation of sin.</b> It is
felt to be so in the home, in the
nation. Disloyalty is an evil thing, but
to break forth into open rebellion, and
to take the field against the monarch,
is worse. <b>2.&nbsp;Because shamelessness in
sin adds to the contagiousness of sin.</b>
One reason why sin is so hateful in the
sight of God is because it renders every
sinner a moral pestilence. Corrupt,
he corrupts others (Eccles. ix.&nbsp;18). But
of shameless sinners this is especially
true. (1)&nbsp;<i>They lead many to imitate them
in their wickedness.</i> In every community
these shameless sinners are ringleaders
in vice and recruiting-sergeants for the
devil. (2)&nbsp;<i>They confirm many in wickedness.</i>
Many are &ldquo;halting between
two opinions,&rdquo; and these shameless
offenders, by their example, and often
by their persuasions, supply that which
is needed to bring these irresolute ones
to a decision for a life of iniquity.
Thus they are soul-murderers as well
as soul-suicides. Justice, therefore, demands
that their punishment shall be
especially severe. Their doom will
probably be as manifest as their guilt.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Application.</span> 1. <i>Let those who have
been thus shameless in sin humble themselves
before Almighty God.</i> Even for
them to-day there is mercy (ch. lv.&nbsp;7;
i.&nbsp;18). Let no sinner be deterred from
seeking mercy by the greatness of his
sins (Ezra ix.&nbsp;6, with Ps. cviii.&nbsp;4, and
Rom. v.&nbsp;20). Yet let no sinner presume
further to transgress because God is so
merciful. There is an awful warning
in the gracious invitation (ch. lv.&nbsp;6).
2.&nbsp;As ignorance is one main cause of
shamelessness in sin, <i>let Sunday-school
teachers recognise the importance of the task
in which they are engaged.</i> Though they
may not be able to point to individual
conversions as the result of their efforts,
they are not labouring in vain; by them
the moral sense of the community is
being raised. Evil as are our days, the
testimony is conclusive that the former
days were not better, but worse. 3.&nbsp;As
habit is another main cause of shamelessness
in sin, let <i>the young be anxiously
on their guard against the formation of
evil habits.</i> But habits grow from acts.
A single action is consequently more
important than it seems. There are
certain actions which have in themselves
a special decisiveness of influence.
When a young man has once entered a
bar parlour, he has entered upon the
high way to drunkenness; he may not
reach it, but he is on the high way to
it. Another most decisive step towards
shamelessness in sin is taken when a
young person who has been trained
under Christian influence joins a Sunday
excursion. It is by this gate that
millions have entered the path of open
transgression, along which they have
hastened to perdition. 4.&nbsp;<i>Let the people
of God be very careful to leave shameless
sinners without excuse.</i> It is by the inconsistencies
of professing Christians
that such persons endeavour to shield
themselves from censure and to silence
their consciences. Hence Eph. v.&nbsp;15;
Col. iv.&nbsp;5; 1&nbsp;Thess. v.&nbsp;22.</p>

<div class="footnote" id="o63_fn1"><p><a href="#o63_fna1"><span class="label">[1]</span></a>
Blind and ignorant consciences speak
peace, or hold their peace, because they have
not skill enough to find fault; they swallow
many a fly, and digest all well enough. While
the scales were upon Paul&rsquo;s eyes, he was alive
and quiet; he thought concupiscence, the sin
and breeder of all sin, to be no sin. Such
consciences discern sin as we do stars in a
dark night,&mdash;see only the great ones of the
first magnitude, whereas a bright even discovers
millions; or as we see a few motes in
the dark houses, which sunlight shows to be
<span class="pagenum" id="p89">[p.&nbsp;89]</span>
infinite. Such think good meaning will serve
the turn, that all religions will save, or a
&ldquo;Lord, have mercy on us,&rdquo; at the last gasp.
The law which nature has engraven, they
tread out with sins, as men do the engravings
of tombs they walk on with foul shoes: they
dare not look in the glass of God&rsquo;s law, which
makes sin abound, lest the foolishness of their
souls should affright them. A number of
such sottish souls there be, whose consciences,
if God opens, as He did the eyes of the prophet&rsquo;s
servant, they shall see armies and
legions of sins and devils in them.&mdash;<i>Ward,</i>

<h3 class="tdc" id="o64"><span class="smcap">Cheering Words and Solemn Warnings.</span></h3>

<p class="bq">iii.&nbsp;10, 11. <i>Say ye to the righteous, that it shall be well with him; for they shall eat of
the fruit of their own doings. Woe unto the wicked! it shall be ill with them; for
the reward of his hands shall be given him.</i></p>

<p>Into these two orders, the righteous
and the wicked, the Bible is accustomed
to divide the whole population of the
globe.&mdash;A crimson line runs between
the righteous and the wicked, the line
of atoning sacrifice: faith crosses that
line, but nothing else can. There can
be no righteousness where there is no
faith.&mdash;This distinction is so sharp and
definite, that no man can dwell in a
borderland between the two conditions.
A clear line of demarcation
exists between life and death, and such
a division is fixed by God between the
righteous and the wicked. There are
no monstrous nondescripts, who are
neither sinners nor saints. This text
ought, therefore, to lead to great
searching of heart.</p>

<p><b>I. The well-being of the righteous.</b>
1.&nbsp;<i>It is a great fact that it is well with
the righteous.</i> It is well with him
<i>always:</i> in prosperity, which is a time
of peril; in persecution, which is hard
to bear; in childhood, manhood, and
old age; in time, and throughout
eternity. 2.&nbsp;<i>We are assured of this fact
on Divine authority.</i> Reason might
assure us of it, but it is better to have
it under the hand and seal of omniscience.
If thou canst not see it, let
God&rsquo;s word stand thee instead of sight.
3.&nbsp;<i>It is the will of God that His people
should know this great fact.</i> He would
have his saints happy, and therefore
He says to His prophets, &ldquo;Say ye,&rdquo; &amp;c.
4.&nbsp;<i>With God&rsquo;s people it is emphatically
&ldquo;well.&rdquo;</i> When <span class="smcap">God</span> says it is &ldquo;well&rdquo;
with a man, it must be well indeed.
5.&nbsp;<i>There are many obvious reasons why
it is well with the righteous.</i> (1.)&nbsp;His
greatest trouble is past. His greatest
trouble was the guilt of sin. (2.)&nbsp;His
next greatest trouble is doomed. The
dominion of sin over him shall speedily
come to an end. (3.)&nbsp;His best things
are safe. His treasures are in heaven.
(4.)&nbsp;His worst things work only for his
good. (5.)&nbsp;He is well <i>fed,</i> for he feeds
upon Christ; well <i>clad,</i> for he wears
the imputed righteousness of Christ;
well <i>housed,</i> for he dwells in God who
has been the dwelling-place of His
people in all generations; well <i>married,</i>
for his soul is knit in bonds of marriage
union to Christ; well <i>provided for,</i> for
the Lord is his Shepherd. (6.)&nbsp;God
has put within him many graces, that
help to make things well; <i>faith,</i> which
laughs at difficulties; <i>love,</i> which
accepts them; <i>patience,</i> which endures
them; <i>hope,</i> which expects a rest to
come. (7.)&nbsp;Day by day, God the Holy
Ghost visits him with fresh life and
power. (8.)&nbsp;He has a bank that
never breaks&mdash;the glorious &ldquo;throne of
grace;&rdquo; and he has only to apply on
bended knee to get what he will. (9.)&nbsp;He
has ever near him a most sweet
Companion, whose loving converse is
so delightful that the roughest roads
grow smooth, and the darkest nights
glow with brightness. (10.)&nbsp;He has
an arm to lean upon that is never
weary, never feeble, never withdrawn.
(11.)&nbsp;He is favoured with a perpetual
Comforter, who pours wine and oil
into every wound, and brings to his
remembrance the things which Christ
has spoken. It is well with the righteous
in life, well when he comes to
die, and well after death. 6.&nbsp;<i>The
blessedness of the righteous rest upon a
solid ground.</i> The text says, &ldquo;they
shall eat the fruit of their doings.&rdquo;
Those are the only terms upon which
<span class="pagenum" id="p90">[p.&nbsp;90]</span>
the old covenant can promise that it
shall be well with us; but this is not
the ground upon which you and I
stand under the gospel dispensation.
Absolutely to eat the fruit of our
doings would be even to us, if judgment
were brought to the line and
righteousness to the plummet, a very
dreadful thing. Yet there is a limited
sense in which the righteous man will
do this. &ldquo;I was an hungered, and ye
gave me meat,&rdquo; &amp;c., is good gospel language;
and when the Master shall say,
&ldquo;Inasmuch as ye did this unto one
of the least of these my people, ye did
it unto me,&rdquo; the reward will not be of
debt, but still it will be a reward, and
the righteous will eat the fruit of his
doings. I prefer, however, to remark,
that there is One whose doings for us
is the grounds of our dependence, and
we shall eat of the fruit of His doings.</p>

<p><b>II. The misery of the wicked.</b> To
expound the woe pronounced against
him, you have only to negative all
that I have already said about the
righteous. It is ill with the wicked;
always ill with him; and it shall be ill
with him for <span class="wsnw">ever.<a id="o64_fna1" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#o64_fn1">[1]</a></span>
But <i>why</i> is it ill
with the wicked? 1.&nbsp;He is out of
joint with all the world. Ordinary
creatures are obedient to God, but he
has set himself in opposition to the
whole current of creation. 2.&nbsp;He has
an enemy who is omnipotent. 3.&nbsp;His
joys all hang on a thread. Let life&rsquo;s
thread be cut, and where are his
merriments? 4.&nbsp;After these joys are
over, he has no more to come. 5.&nbsp;Of
all the comforts and hopes of the
righteous, he is utterly destitute.&mdash;<i>C.&nbsp;H.
Spurgeon, Metropolitan Tabernacle
Pulpit,</i> vol. xiii.&nbsp;13&ndash;24.</p>

Many sinners who seem so jocund in
our eyes have not such merry lives as you
think. A book may be fairly bound and
gilded, yet have but sad stories writ within it.
Sinners will not tell us all the secret rebukes
that conscience gives them. If you will judge
of Herod by the jollity of his feast, you may
think he wanted no joy; but at another time
we see that John&rsquo;s ghost walked in his conscience.
And so doth the Word haunt many,
who appear to us to lay nothing to heart. In
the midst of their laughter their heart is sad;
you see the lightning in their face, but hear
not the thunder that rumbles in their conscience.&mdash;<i>Gurnall,</i> 1617&ndash;1679.</p>

<p>Suppose a man were in prison, committed
for some great offence, and condemned to die
under the displeasure of his prince or state,
and his servant should come to him, saying,
&ldquo;Sir, be of good comfort; your wife is well
at home; you have very sweet children, an
excellent crop of corn; your neighbours love
you dearly; your sheep and cattle thrive, and
all your houses are in good repair.&rdquo; Would
he not answer that servant, &ldquo;What is all this,
so long as I am condemned to die&rdquo;? Thus is
it with every wicked man. He is under the
displeasure of the great God, a condemned
man, and God is angry with him every day;
and if his heart were open to be sensible of it,
he would say, &ldquo;You tell me of my friends, and
goods, and name, and trade; but what is all
this, so long as I am a condemned person, and
God is angry with me every day I rise?&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Bridge,</i> 1600&ndash;1670.</p>

<p>Who would think, now, that sees how quietly
the multitude of the ungodly live, that they
must very shortly lie roaring in everlasting
flames? They lie down, and rise, and sleep
so quietly; they eat and drink as quietly; they
go about their work as cheerfully; they talk as
pleasantly, as if nothing ailed them, or as if they
were as far out of danger as an obedient believer.
Like a man that hath the falling sickness, you
would little think, while he is labouring as
strongly and talking as heartily as another
man, how he will presently fall down, lie
gasping and foaming, and beating his breast
in torment! so it is with these men. They
are as free from the fears of hell as others, as
free from any vexing sorrows, not so much as
troubled with any cares of the state of their
souls, nor with any sad and serious thoughts
of what shall become of them in another
world; yes, and for the most part, they have
less doubts and disquiet of mind, than those
who shall be saved. Oh, happy men, if they
could be always thus; and if this peace would
prove a lasting peace! But, alas, there is the
misery! it will not. They are now in their
own element, as the fish in the water; but
little knows that silly creature when he is
most fearlessly and delightfully swallowing
down the bait, how suddenly he shall be
snatched out, and lie dead upon the bank;
and as little think these careless sinners what
a change is near. The sheep or ox is driven
quietly to the slaughter, because he knows not
whither he goes; if he knew it were to his
death, you could not drive him so easily.
How contented is the swine when the
butcher&rsquo;s knife is shaving his throat, little
thinking that it is to prepare for his death!
Why, it is even so with these sensual, careless
men; they fear the mischief least, when it is
nearest to them, because they see it not!&mdash;<i>Baxter,</i> 1615&ndash;1691.</p></div>

<h3 class="tdc" id="o65"><span class="smcap">The Great Law of Recompense.</span></h3>

<p class="bq">iii.&nbsp;10, 11. <i>Say ye to the righteous,</i> &amp;c.</p>

<p>This is the testimony of <i>conscience;</i>
conscience testifies that that which is
here predicted ought to take place&mdash;that
the condition and circumstances
of men ought to be conformed to their
character. This is the testimony of
<i>reason:</i> in its clearest, calmest, strongest
hours, it endorses this testimony
of the conscience. This is the declaration
of <i>Almighty God;</i> He here promises
that He will do that which conscience
and reason agree that He ought
to do. Thus we have here a conclusive
concurrence of testimony, and the truths
announced in our text should be recorded
in our memory as absolutely
certain.</p>

<p>These declarations remind us of two
things. <b>I.&nbsp;That we are living now in
a season of probation.</b> These messages
are much needed, because we are surrounded
by much that is perplexing.
Here and now fidelity to conscience
often entails much loss, sorrow, and
suffering. Many of the wicked are
prosperous and triumphant. Iniquity
<i>pays.</i> Moreover, the sufferings of the
righteous and the successes of the
wicked are often lifelong. This contrast
between what ought to be and
what is, has been a source of moral
disquietude in all ages (Ps. lxxiii., &amp;c).
Yet it is absolutely necessary. Without
this moral obscurity there could
not have been any moral probation.
There is no temptation in prussic acid,
because its deadly qualities are indisputable,
and because they operate instantaneously.
If all sins had their
penalties as clearly and closely tied
to them, vice would be impossible.
And so would virtue! Obedience to
the Divine will would then be, not an
act of choice, but the result of an irresistible
moral compulsion, and it would
have in it no morally educational influence,
and nothing to render it acceptable
to God. Not by chance, then,
not by mistake, not as the result of a
harsh and unloving decree, but as the
result of ordinance of the highest
wisdom and grace, we are now living
in a season of moral probation. But,
<b>II.&nbsp;We are hastening on to a season
of rectifications and rewards.</b> Conscience
and reason attest that there
<i>ought</i> to be such a season, and the
Scriptures assure us that there <i>shall</i>
be (Eccles. xii.&nbsp;14; Rom. ii.&nbsp;6&ndash;10,
&amp;c.)</p>

<p>The great facts of which our text
reminds us, 1.&nbsp;<i>Should give calmness and
steadiness to our faith.</i> We should not
be greatly moved either by the distresses
of the righteous or the triumphs
of the wicked. These are most transient.
The longest life is really a
most inconsiderable episode in our
being. This is but the beginning of our
voyage; what matters it whether we
clear out of port in a storm or amid
bright sunshine? What will happen
to us on mid-ocean is the only thing
worthy of our concern. 2.&nbsp;<i>They should
govern us in the decisions we have continually
to make in life,</i> between courses
that are right, but involve present
suffering, and those which are pleasant,
but wrong. The sick man who refuses
to undergo the present pain which will
assure him of future health, and prefers
the transient ease which will presently
give place to intolerable agony,
is insane. Let us not imitate him in
his folly. But if the rewards of every
man&rsquo;s hands shall be given him, how
shall <i>any</i> man be saved? This is precisely
the difficulty which the Gospel
was designed to meet. It is precisely
because no man can be saved on his
own merits that Christ came into the
World, and died for every man, and
now offers redemption to every man.
This offer is made to <span class="smcap">you.</span> For Christ&rsquo;s
sake, the sins of the righteous shall be
forgiven them; and for His sake likewise,
they shall be rewarded according
to their works (Matt. x.&nbsp;42, xvi.&nbsp;27;
Heb. vi.&nbsp;10, &amp;c.) Between the doctrine
of justification by faith and the
doctrine of good works there is the
most perfect harmony.</p>

<p>&nbsp;<span class="pagenum" id="p92">[p.&nbsp;92]</span></p>
<h3 class="tdc" id="o66"><span class="smcap">The Curse of a Weak Government.</span></h3>

<p class="bq">iii.&nbsp;12. <i>As for my people, children are their oppressors, and women rule over
them.</i></p>

<p>&ldquo;Children,&rdquo; &ldquo;women,&rdquo; are not to
be taken literally. In interpreting the
second of these figures, we must remember
the status of women in ancient
times in the East. <b>I.&nbsp;A weak government
is a curse.</b> 1.&nbsp;By such a government
the affairs of a nation are mismanaged,
its resources squandered, and
its great possibilities unrealised. 2.&nbsp;A
weak government always becomes
in the end an oppressive government.
By it the national burdens are caused
to press most heavily on those least
able to bear them. 3.&nbsp;Under such
a government, privileged classes and
monopolies multiply and grow strong,
to the hurt of the nation at large.
4.&nbsp;Worst of all, and as the source
of countless evils, government itself
comes to be despised, and the national
respect for law destroyed. In short,
under a weak government a nation
makes rapid progress towards anarchy.
<b>II.&nbsp;The curse of a weak government
is not long in overtaking a nation that
gives itself up to luxury and loses its
regard for moral considerations.</b> 1.&nbsp;It
is only by such a nation that such a
government would be tolerated. 2.&nbsp;By
such a nation such a government
is likely to be for a time most popular
(Jer. v.&nbsp;31).</p>

<p>The cures for political evils are not
political but moral. Political remedies
will but modify the symptoms. Political
evils are really due to moral
causes, and can only be removed by
moral reformations. Hence, while
good men will never neglect their
political duties (no good man will
neglect any duty), they will be especially
in earnest to uplift the nation
morally, and therefore will do their
utmost to strengthen those agencies
which have this for their aim&mdash;the
church, the school, and those societies
which exist for the diffusion of the
Scriptures and of religious liberty.
Wherever the Bible becomes the book
of the people, oppression by &ldquo;children&rdquo;
becomes impossible, and the
government of &ldquo;women&rdquo; is set aside.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 class="tdc" id="o67"><span class="smcap">Blind Leaders.</span></h3>

<p class="bq">iii.&nbsp;12. <i>O my people, they which lead
<span class="wsnw">thee<a id="o67_fna1" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#o67_fn1">[1]</a></span>
cause thee to err, and destroy the way of thy paths.</i></p>

<p>This is at once a lament and a condemnation&mdash;a
lament over the misfortunes
of those who are misguided,
a condemnation of their folly and
wickedness in permitting themselves
to be led astray. <b>I.&nbsp;Men need to be
led.</b> 1.&nbsp;<i>This is our need as individuals.</i>
Every day we need an answer to the
questions, What ought I to do?
Which way should I go? In the
journey of life, we continually come
to crossings at which we are conscious
of our need of guidance. 2.&nbsp;<i>Guidance
is still more necessary for men collectively.</i>
What shall be the belief of a community?
What its action? Like the
apostolic band (John xxi.&nbsp;2, 3) communities
remain idle, undecided, until
the born leader says, &ldquo;I go a-fishing,&rdquo;
and instantly they say to him, &ldquo;We
also go with thee.&rdquo; Men are naturally
gregarious; like a flock of sheep
they crowd and inconvenience
each other, not knowing which way to
turn, until one bolder than the rest
breaks away from the flock, and then
instantly the flock begins to follow
him. <b>II.&nbsp;As a rule men are misled.</b>
Boldness and wisdom do not always
go together. Not seldom the courage
which prompts men to become the
leaders of others, and which goes so
far to command the assent of others,
is a compound of self-conceit and
ignorance. Men are always prone to
trust in the self-confident: they will
believe the boastful quack rather than
the diffident philosopher. Hence in
<span class="pagenum" id="p93">[p.&nbsp;93]</span>
all ages men have been caused to err&mdash;the
blind have been led by the
blind. How true this is to-day in
political matters, in social, in commercial,
in religious! [Give instances.]
On every hand, in all these realms of
thought and action, there are those
who can only rightly be described as
leaders who cause the people to err.
Yes, all men carry within them two
leaders, in whom they are disposed
implicitly to trust, but by whom in the
majority of instances they are misled&mdash;reason
and conscience. How absolute
is the confidence placed in these guides,
and how seldom it is justified! <b>III.&nbsp;To
be misled is one of the most terrible
of evils.</b> 1.&nbsp;It involves the loss
of all the good to which right leadership
would have conducted men. 2.&nbsp;It
involves disappointment, shame,
sorrow, and often irretrievable ruin.
3.&nbsp;It plunges men into painful perplexities,
so that even when they have
begun to suspect that the path they
are pursuing is erroneous, they know
not how to discover the true one; it
seems to them to be &ldquo;destroyed;&rdquo;
they search for it in vain. They are
like travellers who, in the darkness
following <i>Will-of-the-Wisp,</i> have strayed
from the highway into a morass: to
stand still is impossible, and yet to
step in any direction, may plunge
them into worse perils (Matt. xv.&nbsp;14).
How criminal is the conduct of those
who betray their fellow-men into
misery such as this!</p>

<p>In view of these facts, 1.&nbsp;<i>We should
not entrust ourselves to the first guide who
offers himself to us.</i> Let us examine
the credentials of those who ask us to
trust ourselves to their care (Matt.
xxiv.&nbsp;24; 1&nbsp;John iv.&nbsp;1&ndash;3; Isa. viii.&nbsp;20).
2.&nbsp;<i>In weighing the claims of men
to be our leaders, we should have regard
supremely to their moral qualifications.</i>
Their intellectual competency is, of
course, not to be disregarded, but
moral character is infinitely more
important. Not all good men are
fitted to be leaders; but no bad man
can be safely followed by others. He
is continually apt to be guided by
policy, rather than principle, and
policy leads to <span class="wsnw">perdition.<a id="o67_fna2" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#o67_fn2">[2]</a></span> Policy
is at the best but guess-work&mdash;steering
by the current; the man who is
governed by principle steers by the
stars, and neither can be long misled,
nor will he wilfully mislead others.
<i>Practical Application.</i>&mdash;Never vote for
any candidate for a public office, however
clever he may be, if his integrity
is doubtful. 3.&nbsp;<i>Every man needs guidance
more close and intimate than any of
his fellow-men can afford him:</i> he needs
to be led even in choosing his leaders.
Whither shall he look for this guidance?
To his reason, his conscience?
These guides themselves need <span class="wsnw">instruction:<a id="o67_fna3" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#o67_fn3">[3]</a></span>
in the absence of it, they
have led millions to perdition. We
need supernatural and sure guidance,
and we have it (1)&nbsp;in God&rsquo;s Word,
and (2)&nbsp;in God&rsquo;s Spirit (Prov. iii.&nbsp;5, 6).
The man who follows these
guides will be led always in the paths
of righteousness and peace.</p>

Men know where they are going when

back towards the centre of God. And the
man that follows these things knows that he

Reason is God&rsquo;s candle in men. But,

Divine grace, ere it can savingly discern

<p>Conscience, as an expression of the law or
will and mind of God, is not now to be implicitly
depended on. It is not infallible.
What was true of its office in Eden, has been
deranged and shattered by the fall; and now
lies, as I have seen a sun-dial in the neglected
garden of an old, desolate ruin, thrown down
from its pedestal, prostrate on the ground, and
<span class="pagenum" id="p94">[p.&nbsp;94]</span>
covered by tall, rank weeds. So far from
being since that fatal event an infallible
directory of duty, conscience has often lent
its sanction to the grossest errors, and
prompted to the greatest crimes. Did not
Saul of Tarsus, for instance, hale men and
women to prison; compel them to blaspheme;
and imbrue his hands in saintly blood, while
conscience approved the deed&mdash;he judging the
while that he did God service? What wild
and profane imaginations has it accepted as
the oracles of God? and as if fiends had taken
possession of a God-deserted shrine, have not
the foulest crimes, as well as the most
shocking cruelties, been perpetrated in its
name? Read the Book of Martyrs, read the
sufferings of our forefathers; and, under the
cowl of a shaven monk, or the trappings of a
haughty Churchman, you shall see conscience
persecuting the saints of God, and dragging
even tender women and children to the
bloody scaffold or the burning stake. With
eyes swimming in tears, or flashing fire, we
close the painful record, to apply to Conscience
the words addressed to Liberty by the
French heroine, when, passing its statue, she
rose in the cart that bore her to the guillotine,
and throwing up her arms, exclaimed, &ldquo;O
Liberty, what crimes have been done in thy
name!&rdquo; And what crimes in thine, O Conscience!
deeds from which even humanity
shrinks; against which religion lifts her
loudest protest; and which furnish the best
explanation of these awful words, &ldquo;If the light
that is in you be darkness, how great is that
darkness!&rdquo; (Matt. vi.&nbsp;23).</p>

not conscience, but the revealed Word of God,
is our one, only sure and safe directory.&mdash;<i>Guthrie.</i></p></div>

<h3 class="tdc" id="o68"><span class="smcap">Oppression of the Poor.</span></h3>

<p class="bq">iii.&nbsp;15. <i>What mean ye that ye beat my people to pieces, and grind the faces of the
poor? saith the Lord God of hosts.</i></p>

<p>That infidelity should progress among
the labouring classes is one of the most
surprising and unreasonable things imaginable.
For there is no book so emphatically
on the side of the poor as
is the Bible. Were the Bible obeyed,
the miseries of the poor would vanish.
The truth, however, is, that the Bible
has suffered from its professed friends.
The upper classes who have patronised
it have not put its precepts into practice,
and the victims of their greed
and oppression have foolishly accepted
their conduct as an exposition of the
teaching of the book which they have
professed to venerate. Hence the
wrongs which the poor have suffered
have prepared them to listen to the
blasphemies and to accept the sophisms
of infidel lecturers. The employer of
labour who oppresses his men during
the six days of the week, and goes to
church twice on the Sunday, is more
dangerous to society than a score of
Tom Paines or Bradlaughs. Hence
also it is the duty of God&rsquo;s &ldquo;prophets&rdquo;
in all ages to confront such men with
the question of our text.</p>

<p><b>I. Oppression of the poor is one of
the most common of all sins.</b> It has
been practised in all ages, in all
countries, by all classes, in most varied
forms. &ldquo;Poor&rdquo; is a relative term.
Masters have oppressed their servants,
debtors their creditors, officers their
soldiers, kings their subjects, people
their pastors. The oppression has
often been so terrible that the oppressed
have sought refuge in suicide.</p>

<p class="bqpoemr">
&ldquo;Man&rsquo;s cruelty to man<br />
&nbsp;Makes countless thousands mourn.&rdquo;</p>

<p><b>II. Oppression of the poor is one of
the most hateful of all sins.</b> 1.&nbsp;<i>It is
a misuse of strength.</i> Strength is given
to men that they may be helpful to
each other; but the oppressor uses
his strength as if he were a tiger or a
wolf; as if he were a wrecker who
drowns the shipwrecked mariner whom
he ought to rescue. 2.&nbsp;<i>It is a cowardly
and shameful advantage that is taken of
human weakness.</i> To lead a blind man
into a quagmire or over a precipice
would be thought a shameful act, even
by the most degraded villains. But in
what respect would it differ in principle
from oppression of the poor?
The weak and needy, by reason of
their feebleness and poverty, have a
claim upon our pity and help; to
oppress them is to outrage the primary
laws of conscience. Yet how often it
is done!</p>

<p><b>III. Oppression of the poor is among
those sins which are certain to be
most terribly punished.</b> The oppressor
proceeds on the idea, that the man
<span class="pagenum" id="p95">[p.&nbsp;95]</span>
whom he oppresses has no friends to
succour and avenge him. What a
mistake! All the oppressed have a
friend and avenger in <span class="smcap">God.</span> Shall oppression
go unrequited? Nay, verily!
For, 1.&nbsp;It is an offence against God&rsquo;s
<i>laws.</i> He has distinctly commanded
us to <i>love</i> our neighbour as ourselves,
and how manifold are the applications
of this great commandment! 2.&nbsp;It is
an offence against God&rsquo;s <i>feelings.</i>
In a peculiar manner His sensibilities
are outraged when His children act
cruelly towards each other. Oppression
of the poor kindles within Him
mingled disgust and <span class="wsnw">indignation.<a id="o68_fna1" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#o68_fn1">[1]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Application.</span> 1. <i>A new consideration
of our text would deter men from the
sin here denounced.</i> The question
which God now addresses to oppressors He
will, with a slight difference, put to
them again&mdash;when they shall be
gathered at His bar! &ldquo;What <i>meant</i>
ye that ye did beat my people to
pieces, and did grind the faces of the
poor?&rdquo; Bethink you, O ye oppressors,
what will ye answer then? Will it
be, &ldquo;Lord, we thought Thou were too
great to take any notice of what men
did on earth&rdquo;? or, &ldquo;Lord, we oppressed
them because they were weak,
and we saw we could make a good
profit out of their defencelessness&rdquo;?
Do these excuses seem to you too
flimsy to be seriously suggested? Consider,
the, what more valid vindication
will be at your command in that
day. In that day you will stand
&ldquo;speechless!&rdquo; 2.&nbsp;<i>A remembrance of
the prevalence of the crime denounced in
our text will give soundness and vigour to
our theology.</i> The demand of our day
is for &ldquo;a God all mercy.&rdquo; Men are endeavouring
to cover up hell with the
rose-leaves of a spurious benevolence.
But a remembrance of the wrongs that
are done upon earth, the frightful
cruelties that are every day perpetrated,
will convince us that hell is a
moral necessity. &ldquo;A God all mercy&rdquo;
would be not only &ldquo;a God unkind,&rdquo;
but a God unjust, a God worthy only
of the pity and contempt of His creatures.
3.&nbsp;<i>A due consideration of the
manner in which God intervenes on behalf
of the wronged and defenceless, will inspire
all noble minds with veneration and admiration
for His character.</i> Jehovah is
no Brahma, throned in eternal calm,
and indifferent to the sins and sufferings
of mankind; He is a Father,
prompt to feel and to avenge the
wrongs of His children. Let us resolve
to be like Him. Let us not only avoid
oppression in all its forms; let us be
swift to sympathise with all and to succour
the oppressed.</p>

These things are done before God, who
looks upon every part of the human family
as His own. How should you feel if you were

and find upon it a stealthy cat, stationed at
the portal of life, and stopping its very breath?
How should you feel were you to find upon
your child a vampire that had fastened into
its flesh his blood-sucking bill, and was fast
consuming its vitality? How do you feel when
one of your children tramples upon another?
or when your neighbour&rsquo;s children crush
yours? or when ruffian violence strikes
against those whose hearts for ever carry the
core of your heart?</p>

<p>Judge from your own feelings how God,
with His infinite sensibility, must feel when
He sees men rising up against their fellow-men;

He sees them devastating society by every
infernal mischief that their ingenuity can
invent.&mdash;<i>Beecher.</i></p>

<p>What shall become of the oppressor? No

<h3 class="tdc" id="o69"><span class="smcap">The Pleader and the Judge.</span></h3>

<p class="bq">iii.&nbsp;13&ndash;15. <i>The Lord standeth up to plead, &amp;c.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">I. The Pleader who here presents
Himself.</span> Note <b>1.&nbsp;His majesty.</b>
The ancient idea of an advocate was
that of a venerable person who would
be heard for his own sake, and who
would therefore be able to secure for
<span class="pagenum" id="p96">[p.&nbsp;96]</span>
the cause of his clients an attention
that would not otherwise be accorded
to it. The ideal of a pleader was that
of a person noble in birth and blameless
in character. To a considerable
extent this ideal has been preserved in
our English courts of law. A barrister
must be a gentleman (at least in this
sense, that he has never earned his
bread by manual labour), and of good
repute as a man of honour. Certain
barristers have established such a reputation,
not only for ability and
learning, but also for character, and
are always listened to with respect;
happy therefore is the suitor who is
able to secure their advocacy. But
this Pleader&mdash;how august and venerable
is He! How infatuated are those
who do not stand prepared to listen
carefully and respectfully to whatever
He may advance! <b>2.&nbsp;His benevolence.</b>
The ancient idea of a pleader was again
that of a person who undertook to
advocate the cause of another out of
a sense of justice and compassion.
Advocacy was esteemed too sacred a
thing to be purchased with money.
In the course of time the practice
sprang up of rewarding the exertions
of an advocate by an <i>honorarium;</i> but
the distinction that still exists between
a barrister and an attorney, shows us
what the ancient idea of the advocate
was. In God this idea is perfectly
fulfilled. Without fee or reward, out
of pure compassion and justice, He has
become &ldquo;counsel&rdquo; for the poor and
oppressed. Of this fact there is abundant
evidence in Scripture, and surely
it should kindle within us admiration
and love. We justly venerate Howard,
Clarkson, Wilberforce&mdash;shall we not
still more greatly honour God, who
stoops to regard them that are of low
degree, and becomes the advocate of
those who have no other friend? <b>3.&nbsp;His
earnestness.</b> The advocate is supposed
to make the cause of his client
for the time being his own. Often the
supposition is realised in a remarkable
degree. But in God it is perfectly
realised. The oppressed for whom He pleads
He speaks of, not merely as
&ldquo;<i>these</i> people,&rdquo; but as &ldquo;<i>my</i> people.&rdquo;
In all their afflictions He is afflicted.
However frequently men may forget it,
He reminds that He is the Father
of all mankind, and the wrongs of His
children He feels to be His wrongs;
the feebler they are, the less able they
are to defend themselves, the more do
their wrongs wound Him, and provoke
Him to anger&mdash;<i>This</i> is the Advocate
who stands up to plead for the
oppressed. Will the oppressors be so
infatuated as to turn a deaf ear to His
pleading? Let those who are tempted
to do so pause, and consider</p>

<p><span class="smcap">II. That He who now pleads before
them will be their Judge.</span>
An astonishing reversal of circumstances
is about to take place: the
Advocate is about to ascend the judicial
bench, and those before whom He
pleads are about to stand at His bar. He

our use of whatever power over others
that may have been entrusted to us.
Let us hear God proclaiming that the
poor are <i>His</i> people, and let us so comport
ourselves towards them, that in the
end we may come to know the fulness
of the meaning of the Master&rsquo;s declaration,
that &ldquo;<i>blessed</i> are the merciful, for
they shall obtain mercy.&rdquo;</p>

<h3 class="tdc" id="o70"><span class="smcap">Haughtiness.</span></h3>

<p class="bq">iii.&nbsp;16, 17. <i>Moreover the Lord saith, Because the daughters of Zion are haughty,&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
therefore the Lord will smite.</i></p>

<p>A terrible doom is here denounced
against the Jewish women, not because
they were vicious, but because they
were haughty. Haughtiness is found
also in men, though in them its manifestations
are somewhat different. It
is therefore a question of universal
interest. In what respects is haughtiness
sinful?</p>

<p><b>I. The sinfulness of haughtiness
is manifest in view of what it is.</b>
Webster defines it as &ldquo;pride mingled
with some degree of contempt for
others; arrogance.&rdquo; It is a compound
iniquity, and as such is doubly offensive.
In the chemical world two deadly
ingredients may neutralise each other&rsquo;s
noxious qualities, and form a harmless
and useful article: <i>e.g.,</i> water, a compound
of hydrogen and oxygen; common
salt, a compound of chlorine and
sodium. But it is never so in the
moral world: combinations of iniquities
are always especially offensive. How
then must God look upon haughtiness,
which is made up of two sins most
emphatically denounced in His Word!</p>

<p><b>II. The sinfulness of haughtiness is
manifest in view of its sources.</b> Clearly
it springs&mdash;1.&nbsp;<i>From a forgetfulness of
our dependence upon God.</i> Of what is
it that we are so proud that we cannot
conceal our pride? It is of gifts which
we have received from God (1&nbsp;Cor. iv.&nbsp;7),
and for the continued possession of
which we are absolutely dependent on
His will. Some are haughty because
of what they <i>are</i>&mdash;beautiful, talented,
&amp;c.; others because of what they <i>have</i>&mdash;rank,
money, &amp;c.; others because of
what they <i>have done</i>&mdash;on the field of
battle, in art, literature, &amp;c. But
personal excellencies, amplitude of possessions,
or gross success, should produce
in us not self-exaltation, but gratitude
to God. To be ungrateful is to be
base; and as haughtiness is one of the
flowers that spring from ingratitude,
that evil root which has for its seed
forgetfulness of our dependence upon
God, it is base and hateful too. 2.&nbsp;<i>From
a forgetfulness of the purposes for
which God has so richly endowed us.</i> God
endows and helps men, not for their own
gratification, but that they may more
effectually help others. This great law
runs through the whole universe. The
sun is filled with light, in order that it
may be a light; the violet with perfume,
in order that it may diffuse its
perfume. So is it with ourselves. In
proportion to our gifts we are stewards
for God, and were intended to be
channels of blessing: great gifts, therefore,
should not cause us to swell with
foolish arrogance, but should weigh us
down with a solemn sense of our responsibility.
3.&nbsp;<i>From a forgetfulness of our
relation to our fellow-men.</i> God is our
Father, and all men are our brethren,
but we forget this, and so we behave
ourselves towards many as if they were
made of an inferior clay. In a household,
the children who have sight look
not with scorn, but with compassion,
on a sister who is blind; and if we
remembered that all men are our
brethren, our perception of their shortcomings
as compared with ourselves
would excite, not our pride, but our
pity.</p>

<p><b>III. The sinfulness of haughtiness
is manifest in view of the emphatic
discord with the example of Christ.</b>
Every sin may be condemned on this
ground, yet haughtiness is in an especial
<span class="pagenum" id="p98">[p.&nbsp;98]</span>
manner in flagrant contradiction to that
embodiment and manifestation of excellence
which we have in the character
of our Lord. In His dealings
with men, even the lowest and most
degraded, who can detect one trace of
arrogance? Notice especially, that
while He never called attention to His
temperance, His truthfulness, His
prayerfulness, &amp;c., He did point out
meekness as the feature by which He
was especially distinguished, and by
which His followers were to resemble
Him, &ldquo;Take my yoke upon you, and
learn of me <i>for I am meek and lowly in
heart.</i>&rdquo;</p>

<p>1. We may see now why haughtiness,
which we are so accustomed to treat as
a trivial thing, is so emphatically condemned
in God&rsquo;s Word. 2.&nbsp;A very
moderate acquaintance with human
life is enough to teach us that haughtiness
is a prolific source of sorrow, as
well as a sin. It is so in those <i>towards</i>
whom it is manifested; slights are resented
as insults, and brooded over as
bitter wrongs. It is so in those <i>by</i>
whom it is manifested: the haughty
meet with repeated mortifications,
arising from the rejection of their
claims to <span class="wsnw">superiority,<a id="o70_fna1" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#o70_fn1">[1]</a></span> and they are
frequently brought into perilous collision
with persons of like temper. An
intelligent self-interest would lead us to
shun that which God denounces as a
sin. 3.&nbsp;While haughtiness may be
natural in the children of this world,
it is a grave and alarming inconsistency
in the professed followers of
Jesus.</p>

<h3 class="tdc" id="o71"><span class="smcap">Female Pride and Luxury.</span></h3>

<p class="bq">iii.&nbsp;16&mdash;iv.&nbsp;1. <i>Moreover the Lord saith, Behold the daughters of Zion are
haughty, &amp;c.</i></p>

<p>We have here a terrible denunciation
of female pride and luxury. Consider&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">I. Its Commonness.</span> In almost
every age and country there have been
women such as are here described.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">II. Its Causes.</span> There must be
powerful causes to produce such a
wide-spread effect. Like all things
that are wrong, these evil things&mdash;the
pride and luxury of so many
women&mdash;are due to perversions of
things that are right,&mdash;mainly, to certain
things which are among the <span lang="la">differentia</span>
of the female sex, such as&mdash;1.&nbsp;A
keener love of beauty than is common
among men. The love of many
women for soft textures and bright
colours is as innocent, and free from
all trace of personal vanity, as is the
love of children for flowers. 2.&nbsp;A
stronger yearning for admiration than
is common among men. There are
vain men, always on the outlook for
indications of admiration, and they are
simply contemptible. But it is an
instinct of the true woman-nature to
desire to be loved, and to value highly
all things that tend to win love. 3.&nbsp;A
recognition of the gifts of personal
beauty. As a rule, women have more
to be proud of in this respect than have
men. If a woman is fair, she is simply
a hypocrite if she pretends not to know
it. Then there come in, 4.&nbsp;Rivalry,
which in itself is a right thing, but
becomes a harmful thing when women
set themselves to out-dress each other.
5.&nbsp;Timidity, one of the graces of the
female character, but that often leads
to great evils. Few men have the
courage to be singular, and fewer
women sufficient self-reliance not to
follow the fashion. But the pride and
luxury of women is largely due also to
the folly of men:&mdash;(1)&nbsp;Most men esteem
and reward clothes more than character.
Men are taken by such things as are
mentioned in our text, and the fisher
is not much to be blamed for adapting
the bait to the taste of the fish. (2.)&nbsp;Even
of those men who condemn female
luxury in the abstract, few have the
courage to banish it from their own
homes. (3.)&nbsp;The lips of many men are
sealed on this question by their own
<span class="pagenum" id="p99">[p.&nbsp;99]</span>
vices. They have <i>their</i> indulgences,
and one of the prices which they pay
for peace in their pursuit is silence as
to this indulgence on the part of their
wives and daughters. There is an unexpressed
but wicked compromise on
this matter.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">III. Its Consequences.</span> 1.&nbsp;The
intellectual degradation of woman, the
concentration of nearly all her thoughts
on the question of dress. 2.&nbsp;The
moral debasement of many women.
For the means of gratifying their
craving for luxury and display, how
many have sold their virtue! 3.&nbsp;The
destruction of that female influence
which should always be exerted, and
when exerted is so powerful in aid of
moral nobility. Sensual grossness in
men is at once a cause and consequence
of licentious vanity in women. 4.&nbsp;Commercial
frauds, to which men resort to
provide the means for the maintenance
of the luxury of their homes.</p>

<p>Men and women are thus partakers
in this sin, and as such, in the days of
visitation, they shall suffer together
(ver. 17, 25; <span class="wsnw">iv. 1).<a id="o71_fna1" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#o71_fn1">[1]</a></span></p>

<div class="footnote" id="o71_fn1"><p><a href="#o71_fna1"><span class="label">[1]</span></a>
vi.&nbsp;1. The Jewess, like the ancient
Roman, or modern Englishwoman, was called
by her husband&rsquo;s name; and she prized the
honour of wedlock, and dreaded the reproach
of childlessness, at least as much as either of
these; but we must contrast the dignified expression
of these feelings by Sarah, Hannah,
and Elizabeth, nay, even that of the jealous
and petulant Rachel, with the exhibition
which the prophet now contemplates in his
mind&rsquo;s eye, in order to see the picture of
social disorganisation which he sees. If a
harem of wives and concubines was still a
part of the king&rsquo;s state in Isaiah&rsquo;s time, though
we have no proof of this, it is quite improbable
that polygamy was the common custom
of the nation, or that they had not long passed
out of the half-civilised condition and habits
for which Moses had provided in the laws for
the protection of the female slaves whom a
man might take at the same time for his
wives; but now Isaiah says that these women,
whose luxury and pride he has just described,
will abandon even the natural reserve of their
sex, and not only force themselves several upon
one man, but declare that they will be content
to share with each other a legalised concubinage
in which they will not claim the concubine&rsquo;s
ancient right of bread and apparel, which the
old law (Exod. xxi.&nbsp;10) had in express terms
secured to her, if only they may bear his
name. It need not be supposed that Isaiah
anticipated the literal fulfilment of his words;
we shall probably understand him better by
taking this as an instance of that poetic or
rhetorical hyperbole, which he so delights to
use for the more forcible expression of his
moral and political teaching. The mystery
which some commentators have seen in the
numbers &ldquo;seven&rdquo; and &ldquo;one&rdquo; in this passage,
and which is even said to have occasioned the
separation of this portion of the prophecy into
a distinct chapter, perhaps makes worth while
the obvious remark that it is nothing more
than the wide-spread idiom of modern as well
as ancient languages, by which a definite or
round number is put for an indefinite. Seven
is thus generally used by the Hebrews for any
considerable number, as it was among the
Egyptians and Persians, and is still said to be
in the East. The Moguls are said to employ
nine in like manner. So, in English, we put
five or ten for any small, and a hundred for
a large number, in conversation; though the
genius of our language forbids such idioms
in graver discourse.&mdash;<i>Strachey,</i> pp. 55, 56.</p></div>

<h3 class="tdc" id="o72"><span class="smcap">The Desolated and Disorganising Power of War.</span></h3>

<p class="bq">iv.&nbsp;1. <i>And in that day seven women shall take hold of one man, saying, We will
eat our own bread and wear our own apparel, only let us be called by thy name to take
away our</i> <span class="wsnw"><i>reproach.</i><a id="o72_fna1" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#o72_fn1">[1]</a></span></p>

<p>This verse gives us a vivid picture
of the desolating and disorganising
power of war. The 25th and 26th
verses of the previous chapter say
&ldquo;Thy men shall fall by the sword,
and thy mighty in the war. And her
gates shall lament and mourn, and she
being desolate shall sit on the ground.&rdquo;
This righteous chastisement has come.
So often have the men been called into
the field, so exterminating has been the
carnage, as that now few men remain.
The natural proportion of the sexes is
disturbed. This disorganisation invades
woman&rsquo;s nature. Her natural
modesty departs. With violent importunity
seven women press marriage
on one man. They will be no expense
to him; they will earn their own food
and raiment, if he will only give them
his name in marriage. The writer of
this outline has recently travelled in a
land [Mexico] whose revolutions during
the last fifty years have been so frequent
<span class="pagenum" id="p100">[p.&nbsp;100]</span>
as that he found parts of the
country where the prophet&rsquo;s words are
true to-day. The men have been killed
in battle. In some districts there are
seven women to one man.</p>

<p><b>I. The tendency of sin is to produce
war and to degrade women.</b> The
apostle James has described the generals
of war (iv.&nbsp;1). Nations are but the
aggregate of individuals. If the lusts
of selfishness, greed, malice, &amp;c., nestle
like vipers in the hearts of individual
men, they will be manifest in the
nation. 1.&nbsp;<i>Sin deteriorates man&rsquo;s intellectual
faculties.</i> In its present unpurified
condition, the human intellect
is not inventive enough to discover
those commercial relationships which
will eventually bind in bonds of amity
the nations of the world together. 2.&nbsp;<i>Sin
intensifies human selfishness.</i> One
of the most desolating wars of modern
times originated in that gross selfishness
which was too blind to see that it
was a sin to hold property in man. 3.&nbsp;<i>Sin
intensifies human greed.</i> &ldquo;Cursed
be he that removeth his neighbour&rsquo;s
landmark,&rdquo; is a despised threat. Again
and again his war originated in greed
of territory and lust of plunder. 4.&nbsp;<i>Sin
intensifies human ambition.</i> In the
heart of all great conquerors, from
Nimrod to Napoleon, has lain the lust
of unholy ambition. Their motto has
ever been &ldquo;Better to reign in hell than
serve in heaven.&rdquo; 5.&nbsp;Side by side
with these lusts of selfishness, greed,
ambition, &amp;c., there has <i>been a lack of
justice and mercy.</i> No mind having
these latter sentiments healthily developed
could &ldquo;cry havock and let slip
the dogs of war.&rdquo; When the leaders
of nations learn &ldquo;to do justly and love
mercy,&rdquo; wars will be less common. 6.&nbsp;<i>With
war have come numerous evils to
woman.</i> The text describes some of
them. Others come to the surface
every day. Her husband has been
forced from her side, or her sons have
died on the battlefield; very bitter have
been woman&rsquo;s sorrows,&mdash;&ldquo;Yea, a sword
hath pierced through her own soul also.&rdquo;
And always where soldiers are multiplied
in a land, and taken away from useful
employment, women have been polluted
and degraded. War and womanly degradation
are inseparable evils.</p>

<p><b>II. It is the tendency of Christianity
to produce peace and elevate women.</b>
1.&nbsp;<i>To produce peace in its loftiest and
widest sense Christ came into the world.</i>
The prophet Isaiah predicted Him as
the Prince of Peace (ix.&nbsp;6). At His
birth angels sang, &ldquo;Peace on earth,
good-will to man&rdquo; (Luke ii.&nbsp;14). 2.&nbsp;<i>By
His atoning work He has laid the
foundation of peace between man and God,</i>
and consequently between man and
man. 3.&nbsp;<i>The direct influence of Christ&rsquo;s
religion is to restrain and destroy those
evil propensities out of which wars originate&mdash;lust
of greed, ambition, malice, &amp;c.</i>
What is in the individual comes out
in the community. As individuals and
nations become truly Christian and
form the majority, wars will cease. 4.&nbsp;<i>Prophecy
speaks of a time coming when
the principles of Christianity shall be in
the ascendant,</i> and then men shall beat
their swords into ploughshares, &amp;c.,
&amp;c. (chap. ii.&nbsp;4). 5.&nbsp;<i>As the gospel of
peace advances in a land woman&rsquo;s condition
is always elevated.</i> The Christian
man honours woman as no other man
does. As he grows into the stature of
Christ, woman&rsquo;s lot is always happier.
Compare woman&rsquo;s status in pagan,
Mohammedan, and barbarous lands,
with her status in Christendom.</p>

<p><b>III. Hence while the Gospel claims
as its advocate every Christian man, it
has special claims on the service of
every pious woman.</b>&mdash;Every good man
is called upon to spread the blessings
of Christianity as widely as possible.
But there are some evils whose removal
appeals specially to pious women.
Every good woman should throw her
influence into the aggregate of the
peace spirit, as against that war spirit
which in certain stages of civilisation
seems so natural to man. All women
should join together to make up an
army of peace promoters, outnumbering
the men of the sword. To relieve
their sisters from sorrow and save them
from degradation, should be the aim of
all good women.&mdash;<i>William Parkes.</i></p>

<h3 class="tdc" id="o73"><span class="smcap">The Divine Ideal of Israel Realised.</span></h3>

<p class="bq">iv.&nbsp;2&ndash;6. <i>In that day shall the Branch of the Lord, &amp;c.</i></p>

<p>&ldquo;That day&rdquo; is the glorious period
described in ch. ii.&nbsp;1&ndash;4, and those
verses and our text should be read
together, as the beginning and conclusion
of one prophecy. At the beginning,
the prophet fixes his gaze upon
the sun-illumined peaks of holiness and
blessing in the far future, and his
spirit rises within him in exultant gladness
(ii.&nbsp;5); and then he begins to survey
the spaces of time that lie between.
Immediately at his feet he sees almost
the whole nation given over to utter
ungodliness, the men and the women
vying with each other in their pride
and luxuriousness, and in their contempt
and oppression of the poor; and
then he beholds the clouds of Divine
vengeance gathering and bursting over
the stout-hearted sinners; he sees the
nation spoiled of the men who had
constituted its strength, and the enfeebled
people utterly desolated by war.
All is blackness and darkness. But
he lifts his eyes again, and there still
shines before him the true Zion, dwelling
in inviolable peace beneath the
manifestations of the presence of her
God. This was the vision which was
granted him, and which he recorded for
the instruction of men in all aftertime.</p>

<p>Confining our attention to the closing
section of it, we are instructed&mdash;<b>I.&nbsp;That
underneath all God&rsquo;s purposes of judgment
He has designs of mercy.</b> In
certain portions of this great prophecy
God comes forth in terrible majesty,
and were we to have regard to them
only we should be moved to pray that
He would not speak to us any more
(Exod. xx.&nbsp;19). But these judgments
that cause us to tremble&mdash;what is their
purpose? Not merely the infliction of
righteous vengeance, but also and more
that a way may be opened for manifestations
of the Divine goodness. If into
Zion He sends &ldquo;the spirit of judgment
and burning,&rdquo; it is that by the purging
away of her filth and blood-guiltiness
she may be made meet to be the dwelling-place
of God. <b>II.&nbsp;That God resolved
to carry out His purposes of
mercy by a suitable agent.</b> He is here
designated by a twofold description,
the parts of which appear to be contradictory.
He is at once &ldquo;the Branch
of the Lord&rdquo; and &ldquo;the Fruit of the
earth.&rdquo; The significance of the first of
these titles becomes more plain as we
trace it in prophecy (Jer. xxiii.&nbsp;5,
xxxiii.&nbsp;15; Zech. iii.&nbsp;8, vi.&nbsp;12). So
that &ldquo;the Branch of the Lord&rdquo; is a
man, the son of David, that son concerning
whom he sang in the seventy-second
Psalm, the Messiah&mdash;our Lord
Jesus Christ! As soon as we arrive
at this great truth, we perceive what
is the explanation of the mysterious
contradiction in the two parts of the
title of the great Deliverer whom God
was about to raise up for Zion (1&nbsp;Tim.
iii.&nbsp;16; Rom. i.&nbsp;3, 4). <b>III.&nbsp;That in the
day when God&rsquo;s designs of mercy are
fulfilled, the suitability and glory of
the Agent whom God resolved to employ
will be universally recognised.</b>
We know how He was treated when
He came forth on His great mission:
He was despised and rejected of men.
Yet not long after He had been put to
the most ignominious of deaths, an
apostle could write, &ldquo;Unto you that
believe He is precious.&rdquo; So even on
earth there was a commencement of the
fulfilment of the prediction that He
should be &ldquo;beautiful and glorious&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
excellent and comely for them that
are escaped of Israel.&rdquo; We have been
permitted also to see how He is regarded
by the ransomed ones who have
entered into the rest in which they
await the manifestation of the sons of
God (Rev. v.&nbsp;6&ndash;14). By this disclosure
we are enabled to form some conception
of the manner in which this portion
of the prophecy will be fulfilled
&ldquo;in that day&rdquo; which upon the new
earth &ldquo;the holy city, New Jerusalem,&rdquo;
has come down from God out of heaven.
<b>IV.&nbsp;That God&rsquo;s great design both in
the infliction of His judgments and</b>
<span class="pagenum" id="p102">[p.&nbsp;102]</span>
<b>the operation of His mercy is the creation
of universal holiness.</b> The work
entrusted to the Messiah was to &ldquo;wash
away the filth of the daughters of Zion,
and to purge the blood-guiltiness of
Jerusalem from the midst thereof.&rdquo;
There were some &ldquo;written down for
life in Jerusalem&rdquo; (Acts xiii.&nbsp;48),&mdash;doubtless
those who God foresaw
would tremble at His threatenings and
accept His gracious offers of mercy;
and these the Messiah was so to purify
that they should be worthy to &ldquo;be
called holy.&rdquo; Thus one part of <span class="smcap">God&rsquo;s
ideal concerning Israel</span> (Exod. xix.&nbsp;6)
was to be realised. It was for the
accomplishment of this great purpose
that Christ died (Eph. v.&nbsp;25&ndash;27). It
was for this end that He was exalted
to God&rsquo;s right hand (Acts v.&nbsp;31). It
is for the accomplishment of this great
purpose that He now sometimes subjects
His people to painful discipline
(Heb. <span class="wsnw">xii. 10).<a id="o73_fna1" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#o73_fn1">[1]</a></span>
<b>V.&nbsp;That the day of
universal holiness will be a day of
universal blessing.</b> This great truth
is set forth by symbols which would
appeal most powerfully to the imagination
and the hopes of the godly
among Isaiah&rsquo;s contemporaries (ver. 5,
6). That which had been the distinguishing
glory of the Tabernacle was to
become the common glory of every
dwelling in the New Jerusalem. Moreover,
the whole city was to be a
covering&mdash;a canopy such as in a Jewish
wedding was held over the bride and
bridegroom; the symbol of God&rsquo;s protecting
love. Beneath it, as in a
tabernacle, they should dwell securely.
Thus the second portion of God&rsquo;s ideal
concerning Israel was to be realised
(Deut. xxviii.&nbsp;9, 10; xxxiii.&nbsp;28).
First purity, then peace; perfect
purity, perfect peace. A little later
Isaiah had another vision concerning
this tabernacle (xxxii.&nbsp;2). God&rsquo;s protecting
love for His people is embodied
in our Lord Jesus Christ; &ldquo;in <i>Him</i> all
the promises of God are Yea and
Amen&rdquo; (2&nbsp;Cor. i.&nbsp;20).</p>

As God makes use of all the seasons of
the year for the harvest, the frost of winter
as well as the heat of summer, so doth He of
fair and foul, pleasing and unpleasing providences
for promoting holiness. Winter providences
kill the weeds of lusts, and summer
providences ripen and mellow the fruits of
righteousness. When He afflicts it is for our
profit, to make us partakers of His holiness
(Heb. xii.&nbsp;10). Bernard compares afflictions
to the teasel, which though it be sharp and
scratching, is to make the cloth more pure
and fine. God would not rub so hard if it
were not to fetch out the dirt that is ingrained
in our natures. God loves purity so well that
He would rather see a hole than a spot in His
child&rsquo;s garments. When He deals more gently
in His providences, and lets His people sit
under the sunny bank of comforts and enjoyments,
fencing them from the cold blasts of
affliction, it is to draw forth the sap of grace,
and hasten their growth in holiness.&mdash;<i>Gurnall,</i>

<h3 class="tdc" id="o74"><span class="smcap">God&rsquo;s Perpetual Presence with His People.</span></h3>

<p class="bq">iv.&nbsp;2&ndash;5. <i>In that day shall the Branch of the Lord, &amp;c.</i></p>

<p>Note the contrast between the preceding
chapter, in which denunciations fall
upon the ear like thunder, and the
sunny promise of this. The references
to Zion both in the Psalms and
in the Prophecies are frequent and
striking. Originally crowned by the
Jebusite citadel, it was besieged and
taken by David, who transferred his
court from Hebron thither; he afterwards
erected a tabernacle upon its
height, and it there became the chosen
resting-place of the ark of the Lord.
Hence, in Scripture language, it came
sometimes to denote the entire city of
Jerusalem, and sometimes the Church
or commonwealth of the faithful, which
the Highest has promised to establish,
and out of which God, the perfection
of beauty, shines. You will have no
difficulty in thus understanding the
reference in the words before us.
Applied to the ancient Zion, or even
to the entire city of Jerusalem, the
words are extravagant and unmeaning;
applied to the Church of God&mdash;His
living, spiritual temple&mdash;they are sober,
comforting truths. Consider</p>

<p><span class="smcap">I. The Preparation for the Promise</span>&mdash;(2&ndash;4).
Two things are presented
as antecedent to the gifts of blessing&mdash;the
coming of the Divine Saviour, and
<span class="pagenum" id="p103">[p.&nbsp;103]</span>
His discipline for holiness within His
Church. <b>1.&nbsp;The coming of the Divine
Saviour</b> (ver. 2). The transition from
the gloomy judgment to the grandeur
of deliverance is abrupt and striking,
as if from a savage wilderness one were
to emerge suddenly into green pastures
and among gay flowers. So great a
change passes upon human destinies
when Christ the Lord comes down.
We are naturally heirs of judgment.
But a Saviour has been provided&mdash;a
Saviour who, in the mysterious union
of natures, combines perfection of sympathy
and almightiness of power.
Without Christ, we are hopeless and
lost. Give us Christ, and we are heirs
to all the fulness of God. <b>2.&nbsp;The
Saviour&rsquo;s discipline for holiness within
His Church</b> (ver. 3, 4). With God
the great thing is holiness. To work
this holiness in His people, God subjects
them to discipline, and, if necessary,
to the spirit of judgment and the
spirit of burning. There are some
stains so deep that the fire must purge
them. The constant superintendence
over human affairs which these words
imply is assured to us by the experience
of our own witnessing hearts, which
corroborate the declarations of the inspired
Word. In this superintendence
the Christian will rejoice. In his
anxiety to be conformed to the whole
image of God, he will not be careful or
delicate about the means God may use.
Here is a test by which to try yourselves.
Are you willing to submit to
this preparation for the promise? Do
not shrink from the hissing brand; it
will only burn away the core of the
ulcer.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">II. The Promise Itself</span> (ver. 5).
As we read these words, we go back to
former ages and a fierce wilderness,
where a pilgrim host marches, and
there, now in their van for guidance,
now in their rear for protection,
races a pillar of cloud by day, and by
night a pillar of flame. This was the
vision prominent in the prophet&rsquo;s mind,
when he symbolised by it God&rsquo;s presence
and protection to His chosen
Church. We are the heirs of the
glorious things thus spoken of the city
of God. There is the presence of God
with His Church&mdash;that is the central
thought; then there are right-hand and
left-hand thoughts or aspects in which
that presence manifests itself, radiating
itself on the one hand for counsel, and
on the other hand for defence. 1.&nbsp;The
central thought, <b>The presence of God.</b>
It was in cloud and in fire that God
specially revealed Himself for His people
in days of old (Gen. xv.&nbsp;17; Exod. xix.&nbsp;18;
xxxiii.&nbsp;9; 1&nbsp;Kings viii.&nbsp;10; Hab.
iii.&nbsp;3&ndash;5). So long as the cloud and fire
were in the camp, so long the wilderness
lost half its terror, because the Israelites
knew that God was in the midst of
them for good. That God is still present
in His church is no impious
fanatic&rsquo;s dream. To be sure He does
not come as He did in former times,
bewildering the sight and overawing
the mind. The Divine manifestations of
terror which made even Moses fear and
quake, would not suit this later and
better dispensation of love. Yet our
tabernacles are not merely places of
human assembly; they are tabernacles
of God&rsquo;s presence, and our worship
ascends not to a remote or absent God.
2.&nbsp;The right-hand thought, <b>The presence
of God for counsel.</b> You remember
that this was the primary purpose
for which the pillar of cloud and fire
was given. Consider how much it was
needed by the Israelites in the trackless
wilderness. (1.)&nbsp;For guidance in
their perplexities, God&rsquo;s presence is
promised to the churches of to-day.
Nobody can look upon the history of
the Church with eyes that are not
blinded by infidel films without
discovering traces of a presence and
counsel higher than that of the
mightiest and wisest men. What
chance had she at the beginning but
in the support and upholding that was
itself Divine! Through what perils she
has been safely guided since! (2.)&nbsp;If I
were to come nearer home, if I were to
ask you to not look at the history of the
Church, but at your own history, is
there not something that would cause
you to respond with a joy not less deep
and solemn, as you think how the Lord
<span class="pagenum" id="p104">[p.&nbsp;104]</span>
through all your wanderings has been
a guide and counsel for you? 3.&nbsp;The
left-hand thought, <b>The presence of God
for defence.</b> You know what the pillar
of fire was&mdash;to the Israelites a lamp,
brilliant, exquisite, and heartening; to
the Egyptians that followed, a consuming
fire. There is defence as well
as counsel for the Church to-day.
Expositors have differed a little about
the reading of the last clause in this
verse. Some tell us it ought to read,
&ldquo;upon all the <i>glory</i> shall be a defence;&rdquo;
that is, there shall be protection round
about the glory which is created by
this luminous cloud and by this kindled
fire. Some tell us it should be read,
&ldquo;upon <i>all</i> the glory shall be a defence;&rdquo;
that is, the luminous cloud and the
brilliant fire shall be itself the defence
of the Church. What does it matter
which way we take it? The defence
is sure, the salvation of the Lord is for
bulwarks equally in the one case as in
the other; and so the Church is safe,
whatever betide. Powerful adversaries
have banded themselves for her destruction,
and yet she still lives, while
their names are forgotten, or remembered
with accusation and shame. Let
us, then, not be afraid of future assaults
(Num. xxiii.&nbsp;23). The defence is
not merely for Zion as a whole, but
for every dwelling-place therein. Every
believer has a pillar of cloud and fire
over his own homestead, visible not to
your eyes, but to those of the angels.
There cannot be a cloud upon &ldquo;the
assembly&rdquo; unless there are first clouds
upon the dwelling-places. Consecrated
homes furnish consecrated congregations;
consecrated homes bring the
baptism of fire. Dear brethren, this
promise is yours, if you like to have it.
It is the simple, quiet soul that sits at the
feet of Jesus and listens to His voice,
that has all this done for him (Heb.
i.&nbsp;14).</p>

<h3 class="tdc" id="o75"><span class="smcap">The Cleansing Spirit.</span></h3>

<p class="bq">iv.&nbsp;4. <i>By the Spirit of judgment, and by the Spirit of burning.</i></p>

<p>In ch. ii.&nbsp;1&ndash;5, the prophet gives us a
vision of the glory which shall distinguish
Messianic times. From ver. 6,
however, and through that chapter and
the next, he depicts scenes of darkness
and distress, that were to come upon
the Jewish nation in correction of its
haughtiness, arrogance, and rebellion.
In ch. iv. the light again breaks through
these fearful clouds of judgment, and
under the glory of the Messianic period
we see the beauty and purity of the chastened
people of the Lord. The filth of
the daughters of Zion has been washed
away, the blood of Jerusalem has been
purged from the midst thereof. But
how? &ldquo;By the Spirit of judgment,
and by the Spirit of burning.&rdquo; Here
we have the source and cause of the
change.&mdash;This language is very striking
and suggestive, <i>and reveals the Divine
procedure in the cleansing of the heart.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">I. The Spirit of Judgment.</span> God&rsquo;s
Spirit effects this reformation by a process
of discernment and conviction.
We observe&mdash;1.&nbsp;That a real change of
heart is usually preceded by a discovery
of its sinful condition. The natural
tendency of the depraved heart is to
ignore and deny its corrupted state.
The light must be let in to show that
it <i>is</i> <span class="wsnw">depraved.<a id="o75_fna1" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#o75_fn1">[1]</a></span>
2.&nbsp;That this reformation
is preceded by a discovery of
the <i>enormity</i> as well as the fact of sin.
Even a converted sinner tries to palliate
or soften the sins that condemn
him. Hence men contrive such flimsy
distinctions as &ldquo;white lies&rdquo; and &ldquo;black
lies.&rdquo; But &ldquo;the Spirit of judgment&rdquo;
goes to the root of the matter, and discovers
sin <i>as</i> sin (1&nbsp;Kings viii.&nbsp;28). So in
the text, it is the <i>filth</i> of the daughters
of Zion that has to be washed
away; it is the <i>blood</i> of Jerusalem that
has had to be purged from its
<span class="wsnw">midst.<a id="o75_fna2" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#o75_fn2">[2]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">II. The Spirit of Burning.</span> From
this description of the Holy Ghost, we
learn&mdash;1.&nbsp;That <i>the detection of sin is, in</i>
<span class="pagenum" id="p105">[p.&nbsp;105]</span>
<i>the Divine purpose, to be followed by its
destruction.</i> There can be no <i>home</i> for
sin in a pure heart, nor will God make
any concession to it (Hab. i.&nbsp;13; Ps.
v.&nbsp;5). 2.&nbsp;<i>This process is extremely searching
and painful.</i> It is one of &ldquo;burning&rdquo;
(Matt. iii.&nbsp;11). How many have
quailed under the testing ordeal!&mdash;<i>e.g.,</i>
loss of wealth! loss of friends! personal
affliction, &amp;c.</p>

<p>From the subject three general reflections
arise:&mdash;1.&nbsp;God does not chastise
arbitrarily or at random. He does
it by &ldquo;the Spirit of judgment.&rdquo; 2.&nbsp;Neither
does He fail in the work by
reason of a weak indulgence, which
really would be unkindness. He does
it by &ldquo;the Spirit of burning.&rdquo; 3.&nbsp;The
object He has in view is to promote
and secure our personal holiness, to
make us indeed <i>like Himself</i> (Heb. xii.&nbsp;10)&mdash;the
most blessed result to which
discipline can lead us.&mdash;<i>W. Manning.</i></p>

It is with the children of men as with
the housewife, that having diligently swept
the house, and cast the dust out of doors, can
see nothing amiss, not so much as a speck of
dust in it; whereas if the sun do but a little
shine in, through some cranny in the wall or
some broken quarry in the window, she may
soon see the whole house swim and swarm
with innumerable atoms of dust, floating to
and fro in the air, which, for dimness of
light or sight, she was not able to discern.
Even so is it with many that were careful of
their ways, so that little may be seen that is
amiss; yet, when they shall come to look
more attentively into God&rsquo;s law, a little beam
of light, reflecting upon their souls for it,
will discover unto them such an innumerable
company, as well as corruptions in their heart
as of error and oversight in their lives, that it
shall make them, as men amazed, cry out,
&ldquo;Lord, what earthly man doth know the
errors of his life?&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Spencer,</i> 1658.</p></div>

As the Lord led Ezekiel from one place
to another, and the further he went the greater abominations
he discerned (Ezek. viii.), from the
door of the court to the door of the gate of the
Lord&rsquo;s house, and from thence to the inner
court; so the Spirit of the Lord leads the sinner
from one part of his house to another, from one
room&mdash;one faculty of his soul to another, and
still discovers greater, more and more abominations,&mdash;leads
from the profaneness of his
ordinary conversation to the sins of his religious
duties, from the sins of his life to the
sins of his heart, from the streams of sin in
his actions to the spring of sin which bubbles
up continually in every part of his soul. He
brings to mind the sins that he has forgotten,
makes him &ldquo;possess the sins of his youth;&rdquo;
and now the &ldquo;bag&rdquo; (Job. xiv.&nbsp;17) is opened,
and the sinner sees what he is to reckon for,
he cries out as the prophet&rsquo;s servant, &ldquo;How
shall we do?&rdquo; and as David (Ps. xxxviii.&nbsp;4).
He comes not to the assizes as formerly, to
see others tried and condemned; he sees himself
now at the bar, himself arraigned and
indicted; he cannot but plead guilty. He is
clearly cast in law, and bears the sentence of
condemnation as though the Lord did by name
pronounce sentence of condemnation against
him.&mdash;<i>Clarkson,</i> 1621&ndash;1686.</p></div>

<h3 class="tdc" id="o76"><span class="smcap">The Parable of the Vineyard.</span></h3>

<p class="bq">v.&nbsp;1&ndash;7. <i>Now will I sing, &amp;c.</i></p>

<p><b>I. The privileges conferred on the
Jewish nation</b> (ver. 2, 3). It would be
vain and useless to attempt, as some
have done, to find in the privileges of
the Jews an exact counterpart to the
various items here specified concerning
this &ldquo;vineyard.&rdquo; For example, Jerome
regards the fencing of the vineyard as
symbolical of the protection of the Jews
by the angels; the gathering out of
the stones, the removal of the idols;
the tower, the temple erected in Jerusalem;
the wine-press, the
<span class="wsnw">altar.<a id="o76_fna1" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#o76_fn1">[1]</a></span>
To seek thus for minute analogies is
at once to destroy the oratorical force
and the simplicity of the parable.
Rather let us lay hold of its leading
truths. The prophet desired to remind
the Jews that they had received
extraordinary privileges from God;
consequently he employed figures calculated
to impress his hearers with
that truth; and he does not fail to
specify every particular which those
acquainted with a vineyard would expect,
if it were one from which a
copious supply of choice fruit might
be reasonably expected. 1.&nbsp;<i>The choice
which God made of the Jews as a nation</i>
was the first and fundamental privilege
which He conferred upon them. 2.&nbsp;Having
chosen them, God revealed
Himself to them as clearly as was then
possible through the symbolism of <i>the
Mosaic Law.</i> Through its statutes and
ceremonies were shadowed forth the
<span class="pagenum" id="p106">[p.&nbsp;106]</span>
great truths of His holiness, His mercy,
His sanctifying grace, and the Sacrifice
which in the fulness of time was to be
offered for the sin of the world (Rom.
iii.&nbsp;1, 2). 3.&nbsp;In addition to the Law,
God gave to His people the inestimable
help of <i>Prophetical Teaching,</i> to assist
them to understand its meaning, and
to stimulate them to keep it with full
purpose of heart.</p>

<p><b>II. The consequent obligations under
which the Jews were laid.</b> From
the vineyard, for which the great
Husbandman has done so much, He
naturally looked for fruit. The fruits
which the prophet specifies as being
required by God from the Jews correspond
precisely with their privileges
(ver. 7). He had given them a code
of laws by which their actions were to
be guided, and had impressed upon
them the duty of doing to others as
they would be done to. Now He looked
for the fruits of justice and righteousness.
It was a reasonable demand,
the lowest that could have been made.
Yet even this demand was not met.</p>

<p><b>III. The judgment which God designed
to bring upon them</b> (ver. 6, 7).
As we objected to the attempt to find
exact counterparts between the various
privileges of the Jews and the labours
which had been bestowed upon the
vineyard, so we set aside as needless
all attempts to discover parallels between
the various items of the threatening
against the vineyard and the
judgments by which the Jews were
visited. All that the prophet means
to say is this, that the privileges which
the Jews enjoyed pre-eminently above
all the other nations God would take
from them, and they should be reduced
to the level of their neighbours. The
removal of these privileges was itself
the heaviest judgment that could have
befallen them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Practical Lesson.</span>&mdash;<i>Where there
is privilege there is obligation.</i> 1.&nbsp;You
who are Christians are responsible for
your privileges. Consider how great
they are: a knowledge of the will of
God; the example of Christ; a throne
of grace ever accessible; the counsel
and help of the Holy Spirit. If God
looked for the fruits of justice and
righteousness from the Jews, what
manner of fruit may He reasonably
expect from you? 2.&nbsp;Even those of
you who are not Christians, but are
still living in sin, have privileges; a
preached Gospel; the offer of a free,
full, and present salvation; the strivings
with you of the Holy Ghost.
Despise them not, or you will perish.&mdash;<i>Thomas Neave.</i></p>

&ldquo;The house of Israel&rdquo; (<span lang="hbo-Latn">beth Yisr&acirc;el</span>) was
the whole nation, which is also represented
in other passages under the same figure of a
vineyard (ch. xxvii.&nbsp;2, <i>sqq.</i>; Ps. lxxx., &amp;c).
But as Isaiah was prophet in Judah, he applies
the figure more particularly to Judah, which
was called Jehovah&rsquo;s favourite plantation, inasmuch
as it was the seat of the Divine sanctuary
and of the Davidic kingdom. This
makes it easy enough to interpret the different
parts of the simile employed. The fat mountain
horn was Canaan, flowing with milk and
honey (Exod. xv.&nbsp;17); the digging of the vineyard,
and clearing it of stones, was the clearing
of Canaan from its former heathen inhabitants
(Ps. xliv.&nbsp;3); the sorek-vines were
the holy priests and prophets and kings of
Israel of the earlier and better times (Jer. ii.&nbsp;21);
the defensive and ornamental tower in
the midst of the vineyard was Jerusalem as
the royal city, with Zion the royal fortress
(Micah iv.&nbsp;8); the winepress-trough was the
temple, where, according to Ps. xxxvi.&nbsp;8, the
wine of heavenly pleasures flowed in streams,
and from which, according to Ps. xlii. and
many other passages, the thirst of the soul
might all be quenched. The grazing and
treading down are explained in Jer. v.&nbsp;10
and xii.&nbsp;10.&mdash;<i>Delitsch.</i></p>

<p>I believe that in a poetical allegory there is
always more or less an allusion to the details of
that which is allegorised; but it is only allusion,&mdash;to
be realised by the imagination,
rather than by the understanding, of the
reader, as well as the poet. The several
images are parts of a picture, which must be
contemplated as a picture, and its meaning is
to enter into the mind through the imagination.
Still, a matter-of-fact commentator, like
Vitrings, deeply imbued with the spirit
of his author, will sometimes greatly help his
reader&rsquo;s imagination by his minute analysis;
and I think this is the case in his explanation
of the details of this description of the vineyard.
<i>&ldquo;A vineyard&rdquo;</i> consists of vines planted
for the sake of their fruit: the Hebrew nation
with its tribes, its families, and its persons,
was such a vineyard, appointed to bring forth
the fruits of personal and social religion and
virtue,&mdash;holiness, righteousness, and love to
God and man: this nation was established in
a land flowing with milk and honey, endowed
with all natural advantages, all circumstances
<span class="pagenum" id="p107">[p.&nbsp;107]</span>
which could favour inward life by outward
prosperity; and the grace and favour of
Jehovah, and the influence of His Spirit,
always symbolised by oil, were continually
causing it to be fruitful. <i>&ldquo;And He fenced it,&rdquo;</i>&mdash;the
arm of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> of hosts, employing
kings and heroes, was its defence against all
enemies; its institutions were fitted to preserve
internal order, and to prevent the admixture
of evil from without, with the chosen and
separated nation; and its territory was marked
out and protected by natural boundaries in a
noticeable manner. <i>&ldquo;Gathered out the stones,&rdquo;</i>&mdash;the
heathen nations, and the stocks and
stones they worshipped. <i>&ldquo;And planted it
with the choicest vine,&rdquo;</i>&mdash;a nation of the noble
stock of the patriarchs, and chosen and cultivated
by the Lord of the vineyard, with especial
care, for His own use. <i>&ldquo;And built a tower in
it,&rdquo;</i>&mdash;namely, Jerusalem&mdash;for the protection
and superintendence of the vineyard, as well as
to be its farmhouse, so to speak. <i>&ldquo;And also
made a wine-press therein,&rdquo;</i>&mdash;where the wine-press
seems to point to the same idea as the
sending the servants to receive the fruit, in our
Lord&rsquo;s modification of this parable: lawgivers,
kings, and judges, the temple with its priesthood
and ordinances, and the schools of the
prophets, were the appointed means for pressing
out and receiving the wine&mdash;the spiritual
virtues and graces of the vineyard. And the
end is, that <i>&ldquo;He looked that it should bring
forth grapes, and it brought forth wild grapes.&rdquo;</i>&mdash;<i>Strachy,</i> pp. 62, 63.</p></div>

<p>The points of moral instruction made
prominent in this parable are&mdash;I.&nbsp;That
God&rsquo;s gifts of truth, light as to duty,
moral culture, and opportunities for
doing good, create peculiar obligations
to be morally fruitful, to do justice,
and love mercy. II.&nbsp;That men so
blessed with privileges will be held
to a stern accountability. III.&nbsp;That
failing to meet this, they must expect
that God will take away their privileges
and give them to others who
will render the fruits in their season
(Matt. xxi.&nbsp;43). IV.&nbsp;That there is a
line beyond which God does not deem
it wise to waste His moral efforts upon
self-hardened sinners. V.&nbsp;That in His
view the exigencies of His moral kingdom
demand of Him rather that He
made sinners, beyond that line, an
example of His righteous displeasure
against their awful wickedness, and a
warning to other sinners lest they
venture too far in abusing His compassionate
and long-suffering efforts to
reclaim and save them. It is a terrible
thing to withstand God in His

His will.</b> 1.&nbsp;Obviously this is true of
the great privileges accorded to the
Jewish nation. They were not granted
because of anything in them (Deut.
vii.&nbsp;7; ix.&nbsp;4&ndash;6, &amp;c.). There were
other &ldquo;hills&rdquo; that would have been
just as suitable for a vineyard, and
just as fruitful, had the great Husbandman
been pleased to deal with them
in the same manner. 2.&nbsp;If we consider
our own religious privileges, we
must acknowledge the same great
principle: other nations still heathen
<i>deserve</i> them just as much as we do;
and our heathen forefathers to whom
they were first granted were in no
sense superior to the heathen of to-day.
We owe our superiority to our
privileges, not our privileges to our
superiority. 3.&nbsp;The same principle is
as true of temporal as of spiritual
privileges. Why are some born clever,
and others stupid? some strong and
others weak? some rich, and others
poor? We can return no other answer
than that such is the will of God.&mdash;This
principle seems to be surrounded
by a cloud of mystery; but there are
rays of light that relieve it,&mdash;to some
of them we shall presently refer; and
we must be careful not to darken it
by our own folly. We must not
<span class="pagenum" id="p108">[p.&nbsp;108]</span>
imagine, because God acts according
to the good pleasure of His will, that
therefore He acts arbitrarily, capriciously,
out of mere whim and fancy.
Though He may not disclose to us the
reasons for many of His procedures,
we may be sure that He has good
reasons. In withholding them from
us&mdash;possibly because we are as yet
incapable of understanding them,&mdash;and
thus making demands upon our
faith, He deals with us just as we
frequently deal with our children.</p>

<p><b>II. Great privileges involve great
responsibilities.</b> From the vineyard
so carefully cultivated choice grapes
are justly expected. This is a truth so
familiar that it is apt to become to us
a mere truism. But we shall do well
to look at it steadily,&mdash;1.&nbsp;<i>As a guide
to us in our duty.</i> It is well to pause
and consider what privileges God has
conferred upon is, that we may be
aroused to a perception of the nature
and extent of the demands which He
is certain to make upon us. In view
of our privileges, what ought our life
to be? (Luke xii.&nbsp;48). 2.&nbsp;<i>As a help to
us in our perplexities.</i> In view of such
providential arrangements as have been
referred to, these are sometimes very
painful. But we must remember that
the great principle before us admits
of being very variously stated. It is
just as true that &ldquo;small privileges
involve small responsibilities.&rdquo; We
shall adopt the slander of the wicked
and slothful servant if we think of
God as a hard master who seeks to
reap where He has not sown. If
God has entrusted to any man only
one talent,&mdash;and He entrusts to every
man at least as much as that,&mdash;He
will not demand from him the usury
upon ten talents, nor upon two.</p>

<p><b>III. Great privileges do not necessarily
result in great happiness.</b> They
ought to do so; they often do so;
but as frequently they fail to do so.
Even in temporal things, the happiest
men are not always those whose possessions
are most various and ample.
The most learned men are not always
those who own the largest libraries.
And the holiest men are not always
those whose religious opportunities are
most numerous and great. Why is it,
that great privileges and great happiness
are not always associated? Because
man is a voluntary agent, and
God will not force happiness upon
any man. He may offer us eternal
life, but we must &ldquo;lay hold&rdquo; of it.
He may shed upon our path great light,
but we must walk in it (ch. ii.&nbsp;5).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Practical Lesson.</span>&mdash;Instead of repining
because our privileges are not
more numerous and great, let us diligently
use those which have been granted
to us, and so make them what they were
intended to be&mdash;sources of blessing to
us. Enclosed within God&rsquo;s vineyard,
and carefully cultured by Him, let us
see to it that the grapes we bring forth
are not wild grapes.</p>

<p><b>IV. Great privileges neglected or
misused bring on great condemnations</b>
(ver. 5, 6). Compare also Luke xiii.&nbsp;6&ndash;9.
Had that fig-tree been growing
on some open common, notwithstanding
its barrenness, it might have stood
till it decayed, but because it was
barren in a &ldquo;vineyard&rdquo; the righteous
order is given, &ldquo;Cut it down!&rdquo; This
principle, also, we may turn to practical
account. Like a former one, we may
use it&mdash;1.&nbsp;<i>To help us in our perplexities.</i>
Sometimes we are in trouble to know
what will become of the heathen in
the day of judgment. Well, even if
they are condemned, they will be condemned
less severely than those who
have misused greater privileges (Matt.
xi.&nbsp;22; Luke xii.&nbsp;48). 2.&nbsp;<i>To stimulate
us to a faithful discharge of duty.</i> Fear
is not the highest motive, but it is a
very useful one, and not truly wise man
will leave it out of account. We need
every kind of help to fortify us against
temptation, and it is good to remember
what will be the result if we yield to
it, and so remain barren and unfruitful,
or even bring forth &ldquo;wild grapes&rdquo;
(Heb. iv.&nbsp;1; 1&nbsp;Pet. i.&nbsp;7; Phil. ii.&nbsp;12).</p>

<p>Fear is useful as a motive, but hope
is still more helpful; and in the matter
of our salvation we may employ both
fear and hope as allies. Reverse the
last principle, and read it thus, <b>Great</b>
<span class="pagenum" id="p109">[p.&nbsp;109]</span>
<b>privileges well used secure corresponding
rewards.</b> Compare Luke xix.&nbsp;17.
If the choice vine planted in the fruitful
vineyard brings forth &ldquo;good grapes,&rdquo;
the Husbandman will pronounce over
it rejoicing benedictions (Heb. vi.&nbsp;7).</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 class="tdc" id="o79"><span class="smcap">Divine Disappointments.</span></h3>

<p class="bq">v.&nbsp;2. <i>He looked that it should bring forth grapes, and it brought forth wild grapes.</i></p>

<p>&ldquo;I believe in God.&rdquo; Which god?
The god constructed for us by philosophers,
who is impassive, throned in
eternal calm, unmoved by the crimes
or the virtues of men, all of which he
has foreseen from eternal ages, and
which cannot in any way affect him
at the time of their occurrence; a god
who towers above men, majestic and
unchangeable, like an Alpine peak,
which is the same whether sunlight
cheers or clouds darken the valleys
beneath? No, but the God of the
Bible, who loves and hates, who rejoices
with us in our gladness and
sorrows with us in our griefs, who
foresees and overrules all, and yet can
hope and be disappointed.</p>

<p>I. That God can be disappointed is
distinctly the implication of our text.
&ldquo;He <i>looked</i> that it,&rdquo; &amp;c. 1.&nbsp;Isaiah&rsquo;s
parable recalls the privileges which
God had conferred upon the Jews;
and we know that He dealt with them
as He did, in order that they might
become a holy nation (Exod. xix.&nbsp;6;
Deut. vii.&nbsp;6, xxvi.&nbsp;18, 19). Was
their persistent unholiness no disappointment
to Him? 2.&nbsp;The same
truth is implied in what we are told
of God&rsquo;s feelings in view of the wickedness
of the antediluvians (Gen. vi.&nbsp;5, 6).
He had made man in His own
image, in order that He might continue
therein, and shine with the lustre of
His own moral perfections; each man
was to be a <i>planet</i> in the moral universe,
reflecting the glory of the great
central Sun; and when He saw man
transformed into the image of Satan,
and His purposes concerning him
frustrated, He was filled with profound
regret. 3.&nbsp;The same truth is
implied in what we are told concerning
Christ. &ldquo;He came unto His own&rdquo;
(John i.&nbsp;11). For what purpose?
Certainly not that He might be rejected,
but that He might be received by
them. But He <i>was</i> rejected! See
how forcibly this is brought out in His
parable (Luke xx.&nbsp;9&ndash;15&mdash;especially
verse 13). 4.&nbsp;It is implied in Christ&rsquo;s
tears and lament over Jerusalem (Luke
xix.&nbsp;41; Matt xxiii.&nbsp;37). 5.&nbsp;It is
implied in the apostolic declarations,
that God is desirous that all men
should repent and be saved (1&nbsp;Tim. ii.&nbsp;4;
2&nbsp;Pet. iii.&nbsp;9). We must not
minimise the force of <span lang="grc">&theta;&#x3AD;&lambda;&epsilon;&iota;&mdash;&#x1F42;&sigmaf;
&pi;&#x3AC;&nu;&tau;&alpha;&sigmaf;
&#x3AC;&nu;&theta;&rho;&#x3CE;&pi;&omicron;&upsilon;&sigmaf;
&theta;&#x3AD;&lambda;&epsilon;&iota;
&sigma;&omega;&theta;&eta;&#x0342;&nu;&alpha;&iota;.</span> The strength
of any one&rsquo;s desire is to be measured
by what he will do or sacrifice to
accomplish it; and God gave His
only begotten Son in order that all
men might have everlasting life. But
all men are not saved. That the
Scriptures teach that God can be&mdash;and
often is&mdash;disappointed, is clear.</p>

<p>II. &ldquo;But it is impossible that God
can be disappointed, seeing that He
is omniscient and foresees all things.
Surprise, and consequently disappointment,
is not possible to perfect knowledge.&rdquo;
1.&nbsp;This objection appears to
be very reasonable, but against it there
is this fatal objection, that we cannot
measure God by our <span class="wsnw">reason.<a id="o79_fna1" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#o79_fn1">[1]</a></span> We
cannot tell how He will act or feel
under certain circumstances: all we
know is, that under all circumstances
God will act and feel in a manner
worthy of Himself. But what is, or is
not, consistent with His attributes, we
are not in a position to determine.
Take, for instance, His omnipresence.
If we were present when dastardly
wrongs and great crimes are committed,
and were clothed with power to prevent
them, how certain it is that we
should prevent <span class="wsnw">them!<a id="o79_fna2" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#o79_fn2">[2]</a></span> But every
day He stands by and sees such wickednesses
perpetrated, and is silent, and
gives no sign. Let us, then, not be in
a hurry to decide that disappointment
is not consistent with omniscience. 2.&nbsp;There
is an experience very frequent
<span class="pagenum" id="p110">[p.&nbsp;110]</span>
among men, which may perhaps help
us a little to understand what disappointment
is in God. Evils may be
long distinctly foreseen&mdash;as, for example,
the death of a dear friend
suffering from an incurable disease&mdash;but
yet not realised until they actually
occur. The blow is foreseen long
before it falls, but it is felt when it
falls. Every man knows that he must
die, and yet how nearly a surprise is
death to every man! 3.&nbsp;Whether we
can understand it or not, it is our duty
to accept this declaration, that in view
of the ingratitude and sinfulness of
men whom God has blessed and has
sought to win by virtue and holiness,
He is profoundly grieved and disappointed.
Such declarations are not
to be dismissed as &ldquo;anthropomorphological.&rdquo;
However much that is in them
may be figurative, there is a reality
behind the figures.</p>

<p>III. Whatever mystery may attach
to this declaration, consider how precious
it is&mdash;1.&nbsp;A God who can be disappointed
is precisely the God we need.
How else could we be assured of His
sympathy with us in the disappointments
which so frequently come upon
us, and which make up so considerable
a part of the experiences of our life?
Were God such a being as the philosophers
have imagined, we might feel
that He understood us, as an anatomist
understands exactly how a frog
on which he is operating will act when
exposed to galvanic shocks, but we
could not have had the inexpressible
consolation of the assurance of His
sympathy. It is only a mother who
has been bereaved who can comfort a
mother who is weeping over her dead
child. 2.&nbsp;A God who is so much interested
in us that our failures in virtue
inspire Him with profound grief and
disappointment, is against precisely the
God we need. Of what value to us
would be a God who looked upon us
with as little emotion as a king may be
supposed to do upon the ants who
crawl across his path? It is because
men do not think of God as He is
revealed in our text, that they sin
against Him; if they did but realise
how He feels about them, it would be
impossible for them to transgress as
they do. I accept His declaration, that
He is disappointed in view of human
sin, and I try to measure His disappointment.
I find help in this endeavour
in this Old Testament parable:
how profound would be the disappointment
of a husbandman under such
circumstances as are supposed! But
I find yet more valuable help in the
greatest of the New Testament parables.
How bitter must have been the disappointment
of the father of the Prodigal
when he went away into a far country!
Such disappointments break the
hearts of tens of thousands of fathers
and mothers, and brings down their
grey hairs with sorrow to the grave;
and precisely such disappointment it is,
only vaster, deeper, sadder, that fills
the heart of our Heavenly Father
when His children go astray. It is
thus that some of you have grieved
Him; it is thus that some of you are
grieving Him to-day by your contemptuous
disregard of His offers of
mercy and forgiveness. Oh, think
what it is that you do, and surely your
carelessness must give place to profound
contrition, and you will resemble
the Prodigal in your penitence, as you
have done in your ingratitude and your
guilt.</p>

God? Stop then thy over-bold inquiries,

During one part of the trip our party was
augmented by a redif, or soldier of the reserves,
who was going home on leave of absence. He
wore the uniform of the Turkish soldier, but
I observed that in the evening he threw over
his shoulders a woman&rsquo;s robe, made of a soft
thin kind of felt, worn by the women in this
country, and beautifully embroidered in colours
around the neck and bosom. I had the curiosity
to inquire into the history of this gown,
and could scarcely restrain my indignation at
the story I heard. The soldier said he had
got the gown at Saitschar. After the discovery
of the evacuation of the place by the
Servians, he and a party of four or five more
entered the town. In one of the houses they
found a Servian family that had decided to remain
in their house, and throw themselves on
the mercy of the Turks. This family consisted
of an old man, a married daughter with two
children, and a girl of fourteen, whose relationship
to the rest of the family they did not take
the trouble to inquire into. The husband of
the woman, if she had one, was absent. They
began by fastening all the doors, so that nobody
could escape: then they thoroughly pillaged
the house, and took and divided everything of
value among themselves. They were in the
house a day and a night, for it was a rich one
apparently, and it took some time to get everything
properly divided and packed; and besides,
they were disposed to be merry and make a
night of it.</p>

<p>I will not enter into the details of what they
did during the night, because there are people
who do not apparently object in the least to
the commission of these deeds, who object to
anybody lifting a finger to prevent them, or
even to the expression of any indignation on
the subject, but who are dreadfully shocked
at the recital of them; and I wish to spare
the feelings of these sensitive persons. Suffice
it to say that the next morning the question
arose as to what should be done with the two
women, the two children, and the old man.
Some of the party were in favour of letting
them go; but the rest were of opinion that it
would be amusing to kill them, and a discussion
ensued, which lasted more than an hour,
in the presence of the weeping, trembling victims,
who were wildly begging for mercy, and among
whom, it should be remembered, there was a
mother begging for the lives of her two children.
The narrator said that he, with another
of the party, had leant to the side of mercy,
but that the majority were against them, and
that they finally ended the discussion and the
prayers of the victims by falling upon them
with their sabres. I asked him how he had
come by the gown, and he replied that, seeing
what the result was going to be, he had stripped
it from the girl while the discussion was in
progress, before she was killed, so that it
might not be blood-stained. He had taken a
fancy to it, because it would just be right for
his daughter, who was about the same age;
and his companions, perceiving this, made him
pay rather high for it&mdash;fifty piastres. He was
a heavy, dull-looking brute, and it seemed
strange to think that he had a daughter, a
pretty, tender, joyous little thing, perhaps,
that would wear this gown with delight. He
told the story in a quiet, phlegmatic manner,
and spoke very freely, looking upon me as an
Englishman, and therefore as a friend.&mdash;<i>Letter

<h3 class="tdc" id="o80"><span class="smcap">A Sad Canticle.</span></h3>

<p class="bq">v.&nbsp;4&ndash;6. <i>What could have been done more to my vineyard? &amp;c.</i></p>

<p>There are certain epochs in the
history of the Church when on every
hand may be seen the saddest indifference.
This state of things is not
owing to a suspension of Divine gifts,
nor to the absence of earnest pastors,
nor to the circumstances by which
God&rsquo;s people are surrounded. Everything
has been done for the vineyard
which the wise and gracious husbandman
could perform, yet no fruit is
produced. The fault lies with the
Church itself. Individual members
have relapsed into a state of ease and
supineness. Faithful warnings have
been unheeded; earnest entreaties
have been disregarded; mercies have
been unnoticed; chastisements have
been profitless. At such a time they
who sigh and cry for this desolation,
turn to the despised or forgotten Lord,
and sing their mournful canticle, &ldquo;My
well-beloved,&rdquo; &amp;c. (ver. 1, 2). Then
the Lord replies, &ldquo;Judge, I pray you,&rdquo;
&amp;c. (ver. 3&ndash;6). It is too true the
sorrowful singer admits, and says &lsquo;He
looked for judgment,&rsquo; &amp;c. (ver. 7).</p>

<p>Let us consider the <i>similitude</i> under
which the Church is represented, the
just <i>complaint</i> of the Lord, and the
terrible <i>condemnation</i> He pronounces.</p>

<p><b>I. The Similitude.</b> A vineyard.</p>

<p>This parable is peculiarly interesting
on account of the fact that our Lord
Jesus uttered one in many respects
similar to it (Matt. xxi.&nbsp;33). The
figure of the vineyard is often used in
the Old Testament, generally to represent
the Church. The vineyard of the
parable is represented as being&mdash;1.&nbsp;<i>In</i>
<span class="pagenum" id="p112">[p.&nbsp;112]</span>
<i>a very favourable locality.</i> 2.&nbsp;<i>Planted
with the choicest vine.</i> 3.&nbsp;<i>Carefully fenced
and diligently cultivated.</i> 4.&nbsp;<i>Having the
husbandman living in the midst.</i> &ldquo;Built
a tower.&rdquo; God is His <i>own</i> watchman
on the walls of Zion.</p>

<p><b>II. The Complaint.</b> &ldquo;It brought
forth wild grapes.&rdquo; Observe the complaint
is not based upon the poverty or
paucity of the crop, or even upon the
absence of a crop altogether, or because
of the lateness of the crop. There is
an abundant crop; but of what? &ldquo;wild
grapes,&rdquo; <i>i.e.,</i> &ldquo;poisonous berries,&rdquo; like
those the servant of Elisha gathered
(2&nbsp;Kings iv.&nbsp;39). A crop that could
have grown without the husbandman
at all. An unnatural production.
One calculated to injure, if not to
destroy life. The husbandman&rsquo;s design
is thwarted; he expected that which
would nourish and stimulate life;
whereas the opposite is produced.
The allegory explains itself. The
inconsistencies and follies, the disobedience
and idolatry of the Church,
are like deadly upas trees in the
world; they tend to produce infidelity,
<i>i.e.,</i> moral death, among men. The
mission of the Church is to proclaim
life, by God&rsquo;s Spirit to communicate
it; instead of that, a worldly and
apostate Church leads men to say and
believe, &ldquo;There is no God.&rdquo; This is
unnatural; the proper fruit of the
Church is holiness, obedience, and
zeal.</p>

<p><b>III. The Condemnation.</b> (vers. 5, 6).</p>

<p>1. <i>Observe the mercy of the condemnation.</i>
&ldquo;It shall be eaten up.&rdquo; The
obnoxious growth shall be destroyed.
The pride, the ignorance, the idolatry
of the Church shall be removed. God
will not abandon her, as He does the
world, to fill up her measure of iniquity.
He must be glorified in His saints,
although not now, yet afterward.
The patient husbandman will wait for
another year, when his choice vine
shall yield choice fruit.</p>

<p>2. <i>Observe the severity of the condemnation.</i>
Her privileges shall not be enjoyed.
&ldquo;The hedge taken away.&rdquo; Direful
persecution shall be experienced.
&ldquo;It shall be trodden down.&rdquo; The
Spirit&rsquo;s influence shall be withheld.
&ldquo;I will also command the clouds that
they rain no rain upon it.&rdquo; It is so
with the Jews. That vineyard is
desolate now;&mdash;the vines are trodden
under foot; the rain rains not on
them, <span class="smcap">but they are not rooted up.</span>
God shall plant another hedge, dwell
again in the forsaken tower; and His
ancient people shall grow and flourish
on the fruitful hill; bringing forth
such fruit that the husbandman shall
rejoice, and earth and heaven be glad.&mdash;<i>Stems and Twigs,</i> vol. i. pp. 246&ndash;249.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 class="tdc" id="o81"><span class="smcap">On the Advantage of Small Allotments of Land to the Poor.</span></h3>

<p class="bq">v.&nbsp;7, 8. <i>He looked for judgment, but behold oppression; for righteousness, but
behold a cry. Woe unto them that join house to house, and lay field to field, till there
be no place.</i></p>

<p>I. The Almighty expects from all
His creatures, and especially from
those to whom He has given wealth
or power, the practice of justice and
righteousness. II.&nbsp;The Almighty,
instead of finding justice and righteousness
among His creatures, discovers
oppression on the part of the powerful,
and a cry of lamentation and of indignation
on the part of the poor: the
proof of the oppression, and the cause
of the cry is, that no place is left for
the poor. There is a strong tendency
to the accumulation of property, and
especially of land, in the hands of a
few; but such accumulations of land
in a few hands tends to grave national
evils&mdash;to luxury on the part of the
rich, and to lawlessness on the part of
the poor&mdash;and, therefore, instead of
being promoted, should be discouraged
by the legislature. But year by year
we have been adding &ldquo;field to field,
and house to house,&rdquo; till we have left
the poor no place. Rights of common
and rights of pasture have been taken
away, and the beer-shop established
by law to occupy the time which
<span class="pagenum" id="p113">[p.&nbsp;113]</span>
otherwise would have been employed
in healthy toil for a happy family.
Little farms, held by working farmers,
have been joined together, so that one
may live in luxury, where ten families
once dwelt in simplicity and plenty.
The cottager, in his little field, that
once looked so fruitful and trim, cheering
the eye and charming the heart,
not only of himself, but of beings dear
to and dependent upon him, has been
driven into some town to add to its
misery, its debasement, and its discontent.
Let us pray that there may
come a time when the gentle in rank
shall be gentle in very deed; when the
rich shall recognise that they are
trustees for God, and shall use their
property for the purposes for which
He has placed it in their hands; when
allotment acts shall remedy the ruin
which enclosure acts have wrought;
when an enlightened self-love, arising
out of the possession of something to
love, shall render the demagogue and
the inciter to outrage a foreigner to our
land, and when our &ldquo;common Father&rdquo;
shall find that &ldquo;justice and righteousness&rdquo;
for which He looks.&mdash;<i>R.&nbsp;C. Parkman, B.A., Sermons</i> (1843), No. X.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 class="tdc" id="o82"><span class="smcap">Wild Grapes.</span></h3>

<p class="bq">v.&nbsp;8&ndash;23. <i>Woe unto them that join house to house, &amp;c.</i></p>

<p>It is important to remember that
this whole chapter constitutes one
prophecy. Much of the power of its
teaching will be lost, if this fact be
overlooked. In verses 1&ndash;7, we have
the astonishing declaration that in &ldquo;the
vineyard of the Lord of hosts&rdquo; He
has discovered, not the excellent fruit
He had a right to expect, but &ldquo;wild
grapes.&rdquo; In verses 8&ndash;23, some of these
&ldquo;wild grapes&rdquo; are specified and
denounced. Surveying His vineyard
the Husbandman beheld&mdash;</p>

<p>I. Not the gracious fruit of generosity,
but the evil fruits of <span class="smcap">greed</span> and
<span class="smcap">pride.</span> He saw men, not content with
the possessions which Providence had
conferred upon them, nor those which
honest industry would enable them to
secure, but coveting their neighbour&rsquo;s
possessions, and hesitating at no means
that would enable them to gratify their
desires (Micah ii.&nbsp;1, 2); beating down
their equals, that they themselves might
dwell in solitary grandeur (ver. 8).
Note, 1.&nbsp;That the aggregation of landed
property here denounced was directly
contrary to the most explicit Divine ordinances
(Num. xxxvi.&nbsp;7; Lev. xxv.&nbsp;23,
<span class="wsnw">24).<a id="o82_fna1" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#o82_fn1">[1]</a></span>
2.&nbsp;The conduct here denounced
has its counterparts to-day&mdash;in
the matter of land, great landowners
buying up all the little farms adjoining
their estates, and turning fruitful
valleys into deer-runs; in trade, great
capitalists subjecting their less wealthy
rivals to ruinous competition, &amp;c.,
<span class="wsnw">&amp;c.<a id="o82_fna2" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#o82_fn2">[2]</a></span>
3.&nbsp;That it is not merely particular
manifestations of the spirit of greed
and pride, but the spirit itself, that provokes
the indignation of the bountiful
Giver of all good. Covetousness and
arrogance are not confined to any particular
class. The tenth commandment
exists for the poor as well as for
the rich.</p>

<p>II. Not the excellent fruit of temperance,
but the evil fruit of <span class="smcap">sensual
indulgence</span> (ver. 11, 12). He saw
men living for mere pleasure, without
any recognition of the &ldquo;work&rdquo; which
He had wrought for them as a nation,
without any acknowledgement of His
goodness to them as individuals, without
any remembrance of the purpose
of their <span class="wsnw">being.<a id="o82_fna3" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#o82_fn3">[3]</a></span></p>

<p>III. Not the excellent fruit of reverence
for God&rsquo;s Word, but the evil
fruit of <span class="smcap">scoffing.</span> The messengers
whom He sent to recall them to duty,
they scorned; the warnings which He
mercifully sent to them of the judgments
impending over them, they
turned into merriment. Instead of
forsaking their sins, they yoked themselves
to them with renewed determination
(verses 18, 19).</p>

<p>IV. Not the noble fruit of a recognition
of the truth, but the evil fruit
of <span class="smcap">infidelity</span>&mdash;that intellectual scepticism
which seeks to destroy the very
foundations of morality, and which
<span class="pagenum" id="p114">[p.&nbsp;114]</span>
prepares men for vice of all kinds, and
hardens them therein, by confounding
vice with virtue, and denying man&rsquo;s
moral accountability.</p>

<p>V. Not the befitting fruit of humility
and desire for Divine guidance, but the
evil fruit of <span class="smcap">self-sufficiency</span> (ver. 21).
Clever and successful &ldquo;men of the
world,&rdquo; they resented the idea of their
needing counsel and help as an insult.
They were their own gods. Trusting
in themselves with unfaltering confidence,
they excluded from their minds
all thought of Him in whom they lived
and moved and had their being. Conceiving
that they owed all their prosperity
to their own wisdom and prudence,
how could they give Him
thanks? Confident that they would
be equal to every emergency of life,
how could they lift up to Him one real
prayer?</p>

<p>VI. Not the indispensable fruit of
righteousness in those who are called
to rule, but that evil fruit which always
excites His hottest indignation, <span class="smcap">denial
of justice to the poor.</span> He saw the
judges taking their seats on the judicial
bench, not with clear intellects and the
love of righteousness enthroned in their
hearts, but besotted and brutalised by
strong drink; not dispensing justice,
but selling their verdict to those who
could furnish them most amply with
the means of gratifying their sensual
lusts (vers. 22, 23). Than the denial of
justice there is no more cruel wrong.</p>

<p>These were the &ldquo;wild grapes&rdquo; which
God saw when He looked down upon
His ancient vineyard. Was it any
wonder that He brake down the wall
thereof, and give it over to destruction?
These are the &ldquo;wild grapes&rdquo;
which He sees brought forth only too
abundantly when He looks down upon
this land. Is it not a wonder that He
spares the nation to which we belong?
1.&nbsp;Let us beseech Him still to spare
us, for the sake of the &ldquo;ten righteous&rdquo;
who dwell among us. 2.&nbsp;Let us recognise
that the most urgent duty to
which we are called as patriots is the
abatement of those iniquities which
justly kindle God&rsquo;s indignation against
us. 3.&nbsp;Let us as individuals search
and see what fruits are being brought
forth in the vineyard of our own souls,
lest while we are deploring the iniquities
of our land and time, and, it may
be, are labouring to lessen them, there
grow up within us, &ldquo;wild grapes&rdquo;
which will bring down upon us the
Divine condemnation.</p>

Political philosophy has much to say in
favour of laws and institutions, at certain
periods of a nation&rsquo;s growth, for encouraging,
or at least permitting, the disposition of its
members to found families, to be maintained
by hereditary possessions in land. Yet, if this
disposition be not kept within bounds, those
who are influenced by it will &ldquo;join house to
house, and field to field, till there be no place;&rdquo;
till the race of small landholders, yeomen, and
partly independent tenants, is swallowed up
by a few rich despots. To prevent this evil
among the Hebrews, Moses directed as equal
a division of the land as possible in the first
instance, among the 600,000 families who
originally formed the nation; and provided
against the permanent alienation of any estate,
by giving a right of repurchase to the seller
and his relations, and of repossession without
purchase at the Jubilee. The story of Naboth
illustrates the effect of these laws in forming
an order of sturdy, independent yeomen; but
it must also be taken as an instance of the
habitual breach of the same laws by the rich
and powerful (cf. Micah ii.; Neh. v.&nbsp;1&ndash;13; 2&nbsp;Chron.
xxxvi.&nbsp;21); as they in like manner
disobeyed that respecting the liberation of
slaves at the Jubilee (Jer. xxxvi.&nbsp;8&ndash;16). In
England, where the Norman conquest accumulated
all the land in the hands of a few
nobles, the like accumulation has been opposed&mdash;however
imperfectly&mdash;by laws in their form
exactly opposite to those of Moses; by the
permission to cut off old entails, and the prohibition
to make new ones except for one
generation, and by allowing land to be bought
and sold like other commodities.&mdash;<i>Strachey,</i>
pp. 65, 66.</p></div>

The covetous man is like a spider. As
in this, that he does nothing but lay his nets
to catch every fly, gaping only for a booty of
gain. So yet more, in that while he makes
nets for these flies, he consumes his own
bowels; so that which is his life is his death.
If there be any creature miserable, it be he;
and yet he is least to be pitied, because he
makes himself miserable. Such as he is I
will account him; and will therefore sweep
down his webs, and hate his poison.&mdash;<i>Hall,</i>

which it offers be of gold, and the drink sweet
in taste, yet it is deadly poison in operation;
for they that drink thereof are so lulled asleep

As Moses only saw the land of Canaan,

share or portion in it, so misers have, for their
miserable covetousness, this punishment by
God inflicted on them, that they shall only see
their goods with eyes, but never enjoy them
for their comfort; and that they shall toil and
moil for successor, oftentimes not knowing
who he shall be, and receive no manner of
benefit by their own labour. But as pipes
keep none of the water to themselves that
runs through them, but convey it all to their

Not in the day of thy drunkenness only
dost thou undergo the harm of drunkenness,
but also after that day. And as when a fever
is passed by, the mischievous consequences of
the fever remain, so also when drunkenness is
passed, the disturbance of intoxication is
whirling round both soul and body. And
while the wretched body lies paralysed, like
the hull of a vessel after a shipwreck, the soul
yet more miserable than it, even when this is
ended, stirs up the storm, and kindles desire;
and when one seems to be sober, then most
of all is he mad, imagining to himself wine
and casks, cups and goblets.</p>

<p>And like as in a storm when the raging of
the water has ceased, the loss by reason of the
storm remains; so likewise here too. For as
there of our freight, so here to is there a
casting away of nearly all our good things.
Whether it be temperance, or modesty, or
understanding, or meekness, or humility,
which the drunkenness finds there, it casts all
away into the sea of iniquity.</p>

<p>But in what follows there is no more any
likeness. Since there, indeed, upon the casting
out the vessel is lightened, but here it is
weighed down the more. For in its former
place of wealth it takes on board sand, and
salt water, and all the accumulated filth of
drunkenness, enough to sink the vessel at
once, with the mariners and the pilot.&mdash;<i>Chrysostom,</i> 347&ndash;407.</p></div>

Thieves cannot steal land, unless they
be Westminster Hall thieves, crafty contenders
that eat out a true title with a false evidence;
but the drunkard robs himself of his
lands. Now he dissolves an acre, and then
an acre, into the pot, till he hath ground all
his ground at the malt-quern, and run all his
patrimony through his throat. Thus he makes
himself the living tomb of his forefathers, of
posterity. He needs not trouble his sick mind
with a will, nor distrust the fidelity of executors.
He drowns all his substance at the ale-fat,
and though he devours much, is the leaner
every way. Drunkenness is a costly sin. It
is like gunpowder, many a man is blown up
by it. He throws his house so long out as
windows, till at last his house throws him
out of doors. This is a tippler&rsquo;s progress:
from luxury to beggary; from beggary to

Nothing shall more effectually betray
the heart into a love of sin and a loathing of
holiness, than an ill-managed prosperity. It
is like some meats, the more luscious, so much
the more dangerous. Prosperity and ease
<span class="pagenum" id="p118">[p.&nbsp;118]</span>
upon an unsanctified, impure heart, is like
the sunbeams upon a dunghill; it raises many
filthy, noisome exhalations. The same soldiers
who, in hard service, are in perfect subjection
to their leaders, in peace and luxury are apt to
rebel; (and the passions, which in adversity
are easily controlled, in prosperity are apt to
break loose). That corrupt affection which
has lain, as it were, dead and frozen in the
midst of distracting business, or under adversity,
when the sun of prosperity has shined
upon it, then, like a snake, it presently recovers
its former strength and venom. Vice
must be caressed and smiled upon that it may
thrive and sting. It is starved by poverty, it
droops under the frowns of fortune, and pines
away upon bread and water; but when the
channels of plenty run high, and every appetite
is plied with abundance and variety, so that
<i>satisfaction</i> is but a mean word to express its
enjoyment, then the inbred corruption of the
heart shows itself pampered and insolent, too
unruly for discipline, and too big for correction.&mdash;<i>South,</i> 1633&ndash;1716.</p></div>

It is a hard thing for princes to remember
death. They have no leisure to think
of it, but chip into the earth before they beware,
like a man who walks over a field covered

thinks to run on, suddenly falls into a pit:
even so they who have all things at will, and
swim in pleasure, which as a snow covers their
way and dazzles their sight, while they think
to live on, and rejoice still, suddenly rush upon
death, and make shipwreck in a calm sea.&mdash;<i>Henry Smith,</i> 1593.</p></div>

<h3 class="tdc" id="o90"><span class="smcap">The Evils of Ignorance.</span></h3>

<p class="tdc">(<i>Sunday School or Bible Society Sermon.</i>)</p>

<p class="bq">v.&nbsp;13&ndash;15. <i>Therefore my people are gone away into captivity, because they have no
knowledge, &amp;c.</i></p>

<p>Isaiah speaks of the future as if it
were already present. He traces the
terrible disasters about to befall his
countrymen to their true cause&mdash;their
ignorance of God,&mdash;in their case a
wilful ignorance (Hosea iv.&nbsp;6), which
had betrayed them into courses of
conduct ruinous in themselves, and
certain to bring down the judgments
of the Almighty. The history of mankind
justifies us in laying down two
propositions: <b>I.&nbsp;That ignorance is a
terrible evil.</b> To be in ignorance of
the great facts of God&rsquo;s universe, of
the great laws by which He governs
it, is to be in a condition of constant
peril. We are as men who wander in
darkness over the great mountains;
every step may be taking us further
from the right path, the next step may
hurl us over some unsuspected precipice.
Remember what calamities&mdash;political,
commercial, social&mdash;have been
due solely to ignorance. [Illustrate
by <span class="wsnw">examples.]<a id="o90_fna1" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#o90_fn1">[1]</a></span>
<b>II.&nbsp;That the most
terrible of all kinds of ignorance is
ignorance of God Himself.</b> 1.&nbsp;<i>Much sin
is due to</i> <span class="wsnw"><i>ignorance.</i><a id="o90_fna2" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#o90_fn2">[2]</a></span>
Not <i>all</i> sin, for
there are many transgressions committed
against full light&mdash;the worst
form of iniquity. But concerning multitudes
of sinners we may pray, as did
Our Lord for His executioners, &ldquo;Father,
forgive them; for they know not what
they do.&rdquo; The most appalling of all
sins was committed in ignorance (1&nbsp;Cor. ii.&nbsp;8).
Did men truly <i>know</i> God,
they would fear, love, and gladly serve
Him. For lack of a true knowledge of
God, men who desired to serve Him
have perpetrated the most frightful
crimes (John xvi.&nbsp;2; Acts xxvi.&nbsp;9).
2.&nbsp;<i>Sins committed in ignorance entail
terrible disasters.</i> That unavoidable
ignorance is a palliation of the guilt
of transgression is clearly the teaching
of the New Testament (Luke xxiii.&nbsp;34;
1&nbsp;Tim. i.&nbsp;13), as it had been previously
of the Old (Num. xv.&nbsp;28;
Deut. xix.&nbsp;4, &amp;c.); and it will affect
their condition in the eternal world
(Luke xii.&nbsp;47, 48). But here and now
it does nothing to exempt men from
the natural consequences of their transgressions.
The man who swallows a
poison by mistake is killed by it as
surely as the deliberate suicide, &amp;c.</p>

<p>In view of these solemn truths, of
<span class="pagenum" id="p119">[p.&nbsp;119]</span>
which all human history is one prolonged
corroboration,&mdash;1.&nbsp;<i>We should constantly
endeavour to grow in knowledge.</i>
&ldquo;More light!&rdquo; should be our constant
prayer. Every means of acquainting
ourselves with God and His will we
should diligently use. Let us beware
of the temptation indolently to rest in
a voluntary ignorance. Voluntary ignorance
is no palliation, but a tremendous
aggravation of <span class="wsnw">iniquity.<a id="o90_fna3" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#o90_fn3">[3]</a></span>
2.&nbsp;<i>Let us diligently impart to our fellow-men
such knowledge as we have already
acquired.</i> Benevolence should move
us to do this. We can confer upon
our fellow-men no greater or more
needed blessing. Self-interest should
impel us to the same course. In teaching
we learn. In labouring to cause
others to see, we ourselves for the first
time attain to clear vision. Knowledge
is like the bread with which the five
thousand were fed; it multiplies as it
is dispensed, and when the feast is
over, those who carried it to others
themselves possess more than they did
when the feast began. 3.&nbsp;<i>Every organisation
which exists for the diffusion of
knowledge should have our sympathy and
support both as patriots and Christians.</i>
This is true even of secular knowledge,
but especially of that knowledge which
is able to make men &ldquo;wise unto salvation
through faith which is in Christ
<span class="wsnw">Jesus.&rdquo;<a id="o90_fna4" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#o90_fn4">[4]</a></span></p>

<h3 class="tdc" id="o91"><span class="smcap">Death and the Grave.</span></h3>

<p class="tdc">(<i>For Easter Sunday.</i>)</p>

<p class="bq">v.&nbsp;14, 15. <i>Therefore hell hath enlarged herself, &amp;c.</i></p>

<p>In these terms of appalling sublimity
Isaiah warns his countrymen of the
calamities that were about to come
upon them, on account of the innumerable
transgressions into which
they had been betrayed by their wilful
ignorance of God. Therefore they
should be carried away into captivity
(ver. 13), and therefore also the sword,
famine, and pestilence would conspire
to fill the &ldquo;under-world&rdquo; with inhabitants.
That &ldquo;under-world&rdquo; is represented
as preparing itself for their
reception, as a ravenous beast opens
wide its jaws to devour its prey (<b>Text</b>).
A prediction which, to the prosperous,
wealthy, and powerful nation over
which Uzziah ruled, doubtless seemed
<span class="pagenum" id="p120">[p.&nbsp;120]</span>
the most extravagant raving of fanaticism,
but which was fulfilled nevertheless.</p>

<p>It is of the &ldquo;under-world&rdquo; that
Isaiah speaks. &ldquo;Therefore the under-world
opens its jaws wide, and stretches
open its mouth immeasurably wide;
and the glory of Jerusalem descends,
and its tumult, and noise, and those
who rejoice within it. There are
mean men bowed down, and lords
humbled, and the eyes of lofty men are
humbled.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Delitsch.</i> Our translation
&ldquo;hell&rdquo; must not lead us to think
merely of the place where the wicked
are tormented; it is of conquests about
to be achieved by death and the grave
that Isaiah warned the men of his
time. His prediction suggests a topic
of which men of all times will do well
to think, and that again another topic
peculiarly suited to this day. Let us
bethink ourselves&mdash;</p>

<p>I. Of <span class="smcap">the conquests of death
and the grave.</span> <b>1.&nbsp;These conquests
have been effected in all ages.</b> Generation
after generation of mankind
has been swept away by these grim
and ancient warriors. During successive
centuries men have gained
wonderful power over the forces of
nature, but they have acquired no real
increase of ability to withstand these
dread destroyers. All that science
can do is in a few cases for a very
short time to defer their victory.
The &ldquo;Elixir of Life&rdquo; has been sought
for in vain.&mdash;If in feebleness of mankind
we had not sufficient proof of our
fallen condition, certainly we should
find it in the fact, that so many men
have allied themselves with these foes
of our race. All nations have conferred
their brightest honours on those who
have been the most successful ministers
of death. Warrior and hero have
been regarded as synonymous terms.
In no respect is modern science more
industrious, earnest or successful, than
in the search for the means by which
human life may be destroyed most
easily on the largest scale. <b>2.&nbsp;They
have been characterised by a solemn
impartiality.</b> With them there has
been no respect of persons. (1.)&nbsp;<i>Meanness
is no security against them.</i>
Poverty and lowliness are not without
their compensations, as the poorer
Jews discovered, when they saw the
nobles and men of wealth, whom they
had been accustomed to envy, carried
away miserable captives, while they
themselves were left behind (2&nbsp;Kings
xxiv.&nbsp;14&ndash;16, &amp;c). There are those
whom human conquerors will not stoop
to molest. But death and the grave
have no such fastidiousness. They
prey on the mean as well as the mighty.
(2.)&nbsp;<i>Might is no defence against them.</i>
Rank and wealth can accomplish much,
but they cannot overawe or bribe
<span class="wsnw">death.<a id="o91_fna1" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#o91_fn1">[1]</a></span> Death works like a reaper
in the dark, cutting down the tall ears
of corn as well as the grass that
struggles for existence between them,
the fair flowers as well as the noisome
weeds. <b>3.&nbsp;They have been characterised
by a terrible unexpectedness.</b>
They are certain, but they cannot be
foreseen. While they proceed with all
the steadiness of gravitation, it is as
impossible to foretell <i>where</i> they will
be next accomplished, as it is to
predict from which part of the heavens
the next flash of lightning will burst
forth, on which spot of earth the
destructive fire will fall. Hence the
wisdom of living in continual preparedness
for the great change which will
come to us <span class="wsnw">all.<a id="o91_fna2" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#o91_fn2">[2]</a></span></p>

<p>II. This survey of the conquests of
death and the grave should remind
us that there is another side to this
solemn theme, and therefore I proceed
to remind you, secondly, of <span class="smcap">the conquerors
of death and the grave.</span>
Through how many centuries did men
live without any conception that these
conquerors of our race might themselves
be subjugated! Two astonishing
events, indeed, occurred&mdash;the translation
of Enoch and the rapture of
Elijah&mdash;but their significance could not
be fully understood at the time of
their occurrence. The data for their
complete interpretation had not then
been furnished. But when that supreme
event which we commemorate to-day
occurred, these and many other mysteries
were solved. When the Son of
<span class="pagenum" id="p121">[p.&nbsp;121]</span>
man, who had been crucified, emerged
from the tomb, proclamation was made
to the universe that the ancient power
of death and the grave was broken.
It was seen that it is possible to pass
through them unharmed, and to return
to the activities of life, not with diminished,
but with increased, vigour.
And He who demonstrated this astonishing
truth has pledged Himself to
accomplish for all who trust in Him a
victory similar to His own. By faith
in this pledge, countless millions have
been enabled to triumph in spirit over
Death at the very moment when he
seemed to be numbering them also
among his victims (1&nbsp;Cor. xv.&nbsp;55&ndash;57).</p>

<p><b>1. The victory of Christ&rsquo;s followers
over death and the grave is real.</b>
There seems to be one event unto all
(Eccles. ix.&nbsp;2, 3). But it is not so.
Death is not the conqueror of Christ&rsquo;s
servant; he is God&rsquo;s servant, sent to
conduct them to the rest prepared for
them. The grave is not their prison, but
a quiet resting-place from which presently
the mortal body shall come forth
immortal to greet the eternal morning.</p>

<p><b>2. The victory of Christ&rsquo;s followers
over death and the grave will ere long
be manifest</b> (1&nbsp;Thess. iv.&nbsp;14&ndash;16, &amp;c.)
In the doctrine of the resurrection,
there is much that is mysterious and
inexplicable, but <i>this</i> is certain, that
the seeming victory of death and the
grave over Christ&rsquo;s followers shall be
utterly reversed; as not a hoof belonging
to God&rsquo;s ancient people was left
behind in Egypt, so <span class="smcap">nothing</span> that
belongs to a single follower of Christ
upon which death and the grave have
seized shall remain in their power
(Hos. xiii.&nbsp;14). The resurrection will
be more than a ransom. It will be a
development (1&nbsp;Cor. xv.&nbsp;37, 38, 42, 44).
In view of these truths, let us
to-day keep Easter with thankful and
joyful hearts.</p>

Look how easily Jehu stamped Jezebel
in pieces, and Tamerlane&rsquo;s troops of horse the
Turkish footmen; or as the sturdy steed
dashes out the little whappet&rsquo;s brains, so easily
does Death, with the least kick and spurn of
his heel, the halest complexion, the stoutest
constitution,&mdash;triumphing like an emperor
over all sorts of people; treading on the necks
of kings and princes, as Joshua over them in
the cave; insulting in the terms of Rabshakeh:
&ldquo;Where is Hamath? the kings of Arphad,
Ivah, and Sepharvaim? Elam, Meshech, and
Tubal, whose fear was upon the living, are
they not descended into the grave? made their
beds in the slimy valley, and laid their swords
under their heads? Hath wisdom delivered,
strength rescued, or wealth rescued any out
my fingers?&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Ward,</i> 1577&ndash;1639.</p>

<p>Oh, eloquent, just, and mighty Death!
whom none could advise, thou hast persuaded;
what none hath dared, thou hast done; and
whom all the world hath flattered, thou alone
hast cast out of the world and despised. Thou
hast drawn together all the far-stretched greatness,
all the pride, cruelty, and ambition of
man, and covered it all with those two narrow
words, <span lang="la">Hic jacet.</span>&mdash;<i>Sir Walter Raleigh.</i></p></div>

We put far away the evil day, and therefore
we are not duly impressed by the thought.
But fourscore years and soon cut off, and we
fly away; and how uncertain is our reaching
that lonely verge of life, where the flowery
meadows and the golden corn-fields slope gradually
down into the bars and stony beach
that fringes the eternal sea. The coast of
death to most is an abrupt precipice; we are
cut off in the midst of our days.&mdash;<i>Macmillan.</i></p>

<p>Why should a man defer that which ought
to be the occupation of a life, which ought to
command all his powers in all their vigour&mdash;why

abrupt moments, to his departure from time
to eternity? When a man is going to any
distant part of the globe&mdash;say to America&mdash;what
preparation there is! How much it is
talked about! It is a long, a distant, an
eventful journey. The man talks about it;
his friends prepare in every conceivable way.

<p class="bq">v.&nbsp;18. <i>Woe unto them that draw iniquity with cords of vanity, and sin as it were
with a cart rope.</i></p>

<p>&ldquo;&thinsp;&lsquo;Sin&rsquo; in the last clause is parallel
with iniquity in the first&mdash;a noun and
not a verb. Both are said to be
<i>&lsquo;drawn.&rsquo;</i> The style of sinning here
contemplated is fully given in the next

<p>&ldquo;They were proud in their unbelief;

they were harnessed to sin, which
they went on drawing further and
further, in utter ignorance of the
waggon behind them.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Delitsch.</i></p>

<p>&ldquo;Cart ropes, you know, are composed
of several small cords firmly
twisted together, which serve to connect
the beasts of burden with the
draught they pull after them. These
represent a complication of means
closely united, whereby the people
here described continue to join themselves
to the most wearisome of all
burdens. They consist of false reasonings,
foolish pretexts, and corrupt
maxims, by which obstinate transgressors
become firmly united to their
sins, and persist in dragging after
them their iniquities. Of this sort
the following are a few specimens:
God is merciful, and His goodness
will not suffer any of His creatures
to be completely and everlastingly
miserable. Others, as well as they,
are transgressors. Repentance will be
time enough upon a deathbed, or in
old age. The greatest of sinners often
pass unpunished. A future state of
retribution is uncertain. Unite these,
and such like cords, and, I suppose, you
have the cart ropes, whereby the persons
mentioned draw after them much sin
and iniquity. All these pretexts, however,
are light as vanity.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Macculloch.</i></p>

The whole force of life and experience
goes to prove that right or wrong-doing,
whether in relation to the physical or the
spiritual nature, is sure, in the end, to meet
its appropriate reward or punishment. Penalties
are often so long delayed, that men think
they shall escape them; but some time they
are certain to follow. When the whirlwind
sweeps through the forest, at its first breath,
or almost as if the fearful stillness that precedes
had crushed it, the giant tree, with all
its boughs, falls crashing to the ground. But
it had been preparing to fall for twenty years.
Twenty years before the water commenced to
settle in at some crotch, and from thence decay
began to reach in with its silent fingers
towards the heart of the tree. Every year
the work of death progressed, till at length it
stood, all rottenness, only clasped about by
the bark with a semblance of life and the first
gale felled it to the ground. Now, there are
men who, for twenty years, have shamed the
day and wearied the night with their debaucheries,
but who yet seem strong and vigorous,
and exclaim, &ldquo;You need not talk of penalties.
Look at me! I have revelled in pleasure for
twenty years, and I am as hale and hearty to-day
as ever.&rdquo; But in reality they are full of
weakness and decay. They have been preparing
to fall for twenty years, and the first disease
strikes them down in a moment.</p>

<p>Ascending from the physical nature of man
to the mind and character, we find the same
laws prevail. People sometimes say, &ldquo;Dishonesty
is as good as honesty, for aught I see.
There are such and such men who have pursued
for years the most corrupt courses in their
business, and yet they prosper, and are getting
rich every day.&rdquo; Wait till you see their end.
Every year how many such men are overtaken
with sudden destruction, and swept for ever out
of sight and remembrance! Many a man has
gone on in sin, practising secret fraud and villanies,
yet trusted and honoured, till at length,
in some unsuspected hour, he is detected, and,
denounced by the world, he falls from his high
estate as if a cannon-ball had struck him&mdash;for
there is no cannon that can strike more fatally
than outraged public sentiment&mdash;and flies over
the mountains, or across the sea, to escape the
odium of his life. He believed that his evil
course was building him up in fame and fortune;
but financiering is the devil&rsquo;s forge, and
his every act was a blow upon the anvil, shaping
the dagger that should one day strike home
to his heart and make him a suicide. The pea
contains the vine, and the flower, and the
pod, in embryo, and, I am sure, when I plant
it, that it will produce them and nothing else.
Now, every action of our lives is embryonic,
and, according as it is right or wrong, it will
surely bring forth sweet flowers of joy, or the
poison fruits of sorrow. Such is the construction
of this world, and the Bible assures us
that the next world only carries it forward.
Here and hereafter, &ldquo;whatsoever a man
soweth, that shall he also reap.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Beecher.</i></p></div>

abuse and misapplication of <i>words</i> in
questions of religion and morals, especially
among the <span class="wsnw">young.<a id="o94_fna1" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#o94_fn1">[1]</a></span> To an
almost incredible degree the distinctness
of our associations and intellectual
perceptions depends upon our correct
use of the machinery of words. From
long usage, words become at length
identified in the mind with the things
we have accustomed them to represent.
What, then, must be the effect when
language is deliberately misapplied for
the express purpose of confounding the
distinctions of right and wrong! For
various reasons, it is more easy to misapply
words in relation to morals, than
in relation to other subjects. 1.&nbsp;Ethical
propositions are to a great degree incapable
of absolute proof. 2.&nbsp;In discussing
the great topics of morals, very
few persons bring a perfectly unbiassed
mind to the task. 3.&nbsp;Vice and virtue,
though essentially distinct as qualities,
are still in many cases nothing more
than different modifications of some
common subject. The line which separates
the use of a thing for its abuse
is not always strongly marked; or
rather is sufficiently indistinct for
those who are determined not to see
clearly to afford themselves a plausible
justification for the aberration of their
choice. But on all these accounts we
should be the more careful to use accurate
language on all questions of morals,
especially in society, where the temptation
to speak as others are speaking is
so strong. Two things especially lead
to that perversion of language which
our text condemns. 1.&nbsp;Men &ldquo;call evil
good,&rdquo; <i>from an almost irresistible desire
to cloak and veil their vices.</i> It is one of
ten thousand daily recurring proofs of
the strange inconsistencies of human
nature, that the same persons whose
conscience will not recoil for a moment
at the actual commission of deeds of
sin and atrocity, and who even appear
to defy public opinion in the conduct
they are pursuing, will still to the last
shrink from the admission of those
terms which really characterise their
conduct. It is the appellation and
not the actual guilt which to them
constitutes the disgrace. 2.&nbsp;Men
&ldquo;call good evil,&rdquo; <i>from a desire to defend
themselves from the condemnation passed
upon them by the better example of others.</i>
They attempt, in the first place, by palliations
and misstatements, to render
vice less odious than it really is; and
secondly, by attributing to the pious
unworthy and corrupt motives, to
render unamiable that goodness in
others which they want strength of
mind and of principle to imitate.
From this latter species of wickedness
very few stand perfectly clear. Which
of us has never felt as a reproach the
example of principles better and holier
than our own, nor attempted in consequence
to restore the equilibrium of
our self-respect, not by improving our
own practice, but by depreciating and
ridiculing that which as Christians it
was our duty to admire? Let us be on
our guard against disparaging that sincerity
of disposition, which strives to
regulate its conduct by the unbending
Christian standard, by calling it &ldquo;enthusiasm,&rdquo;
&ldquo;fanaticism,&rdquo; &ldquo;austerity.&rdquo;
Enough difficulty, we know from our
own experience, lies in the way of every
man&rsquo;s spiritual improvement, without
throwing in his path the additional
obstacles of ridicule, contempt, and
odium, which few minds, even the
most religious, have sufficient fortitude
to despise. (Matt. xxiii.&nbsp;13; Mark ix.&nbsp;42.)
Thus, to &ldquo;call good evil&rdquo; is to
imitate the Pharisees (Mark iii.&nbsp;22),
and comes perilously near committing
the sin against the Holy Ghost.&mdash;<i>P.&nbsp;R. Shuttleworth, D.D., Sermons,</i>
117&ndash;143.</p>

The world is generally governed by
words and shows: for men can swallow the
<span class="pagenum" id="p124">[p.&nbsp;124]</span>
same thing under one name, which they would
abominate and detest under another. The
name of king was to the old Romans odious
and insufferable; but in Sulla and Julius
C&aelig;sar they could endure the power and absoluteness
of a king, disguised under the name
of dictator.&mdash;<i>South,</i> 1633&ndash;1716.</p>

<p>I think that one of the master incantations,
one of the most signal deceits, which we practise
upon ourselves, comes from the use of
language. There are words that we learn in
childhood which we abandon when we come
to manhood. Generally speaking, our fireside
words are old Saxon words&mdash;short, knotty,
tough, and imbued with moral and affectional
meanings; but as we grow older these words
are too rude and plain for our use, and so we
get Latin terms and periphrases by which to
express many of our thoughts. When we
talk about ourselves we almost invariably use
Latin words, and when we talk about our
neighbours we use Saxon words. And one of
the best things a man can do, I think, is to
examine himself in the Saxon tongue. If a
man tells that which is contrary to truth, let
him not say, &ldquo;I equivocate;&rdquo; let him say
&ldquo;I lie.&rdquo; <i>Lie!</i> why, it brings the judgment-day
right home to a man&rsquo;s thought. Men do
not like it, but it is exactly the thing that
will most effectually touch the moral sense;
and the more the moral sense is touched the
better. If a man has departed from rectitude
in his dealings with another, let him not say
&ldquo;I took advantage,&rdquo; which is a roundabout,
long sentence: let him say, <i>&ldquo;I cheated.&rdquo;</i> That
is a very direct word. It springs straight to
the conscience, as the arrow flies from the
bow to the centre of the mark. Does it grate
harshly on your ear? Nevertheless, it is
better that you should employ it; and you
should come to this determination: &ldquo;I will
call things that I detect in my conduct by
those clear-faced, rough-tongued words that
my enemies use if they wanted to sting me
to the quick.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Beecher.</i></p></div>

<p class="bq">v.&nbsp;20. <i>Woe unto them that call evil good, and good evil.</i></p>

<p>The conscience of every man testifies
that there is an unchangeable
difference between good and evil; but
each man is prone to think his own
vice little or no sin at all. He substitutes
other names for his crime, and
calls his evil good. <b>I.&nbsp;Many are self-deceived</b>
(Prov. xiv.&nbsp;12). How many
think themselves religious, merely
because they pay some or much
respect to the outward ordinances of
religion, while there is no change in
their character. How many justify
their irreligion, by depicting religion
as morose and gloomy. How many
commit crimes without one misgiving
of conscience, merely because they are
varnished over by specious names.
How often under the pretence of promoting
the honour of true religion,
massacres and murders have been
sanctified, the torch of persecution
brandished round, and the flame of
civil discord raised, to light the path
to heaven! <b>II.&nbsp;Many endeavour to deceive
others,</b> by false representations of
sin and duty (Luke xvii.&nbsp;1, 2).&mdash;<i>George
Mathew, M.A., Sermons,</i> ii.&nbsp;101&ndash;118.</p>

<h3 class="tdc" id="o96"><span class="smcap">On the Perversion of Right and Wrong.</span></h3>

<p class="bq">v.&nbsp;20. <i>Woe unto them that call evil good, and good evil.</i></p>

<p>There is in many a wonderful propensity
to perplex the distinctions between
right and wrong, and to obscure
the boundaries of virtue and vice.
Their propensity is both absurd and
wicked. It most frequently manifests
itself in two ways:&mdash;1.&nbsp;<i>By bestowing
soft and gentle names on crimes of real
and destructive magnitude.</i> Thus, infidelity
and scepticism have been called
&ldquo;free inquiry,&rdquo; indifference to all
religion &ldquo;a spirit of toleration,&rdquo; duelling
&ldquo;an honourable deed,&rdquo; adultery
&ldquo;gallantry,&rdquo; extravagance &ldquo;a liberal
expenditure,&rdquo; the selfish sensualist &ldquo;a
good-natured man.&rdquo; By the use of
such false and misleading terms, we
lower the standard of right and wrong,
and expose ourselves to the temptation
of practising what we have persuaded
ourselves is not so very wrong.
2.&nbsp;<i>By applauding works of genius and
imagination of which the real tendency is
to inflame the passions, and to weaken
moral and religious principle.</i> The
tendency of such works should lead
us unhesitatingly to condemn and
reject them, whatever may be the
<span class="pagenum" id="p125">[p.&nbsp;125]</span>
literary fascinations of their style.
Nothing is more dangerous than a
book which imparts to vice the delusive
appearance of a virtue. Thus, to
confound the distinctions between
right and wrong, is to renounce the
superiority which man claims over the
brute creation&mdash;that of being a rational
creature, for the brutes are never guilty
of anything so irrational as that of calling
good evil, and evil good.&mdash;<i>Charles
Moore, M.A., Sermons,</i> ii. pp. 155&ndash;172.</p>

A rose by any other name would smell as sweet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Yet the Bible pronounces its woe
upon those who merely call things by
wrong names. Why?</p>

<p>1. <i>Names are not mere words: they
are the representatives of ideas; and
hence, they have a force of meaning which
makes them powerful instruments.</i> There
are opprobrious epithets that wound
more severely than a blow. Slander
has slain more than the dagger. The
name of a place or person suggests to
us all that we know, or have conceived,
about it or him. Paul, Jesus&mdash;what
a power there is in these names! How
suggestive are the phrases, &ldquo;an upright
man,&rdquo; &ldquo;a transparent character!&rdquo;
Because words are representatives of
ideas, to use the wrong names is to convey
false ideas. 2.&nbsp;<i>The wrong use of
names confounds moral distinctions, and
perplexes and misleads men in regard to
duty.</i> Right must not be called wrong,
or wrong right. This is to sweep
away all the landmarks of duty; or,
rather, it is shifting all the buoys and
beacons by which we navigate the sea
of life, so that instead of warning us
of danger, they shall rather draw us
upon shoals and rocks. The skill of
every successful errorist consists in a
dexterous jugglery of names. 3.&nbsp;<i>By
giving decent names to gross sins, the
standard of public morals is lowered, and
the community is corrupted.</i> One of the
things that blinded America to the
evil of slavery was, the term that used
to be applied to it&mdash;&ldquo;our domestic
institution,&rdquo; &amp;c. Be on your guard,
then, against wrong names. Do not
try to deceive yourself by means of
them. Pure covetousness is sin, even
though you do call it economy, &amp;c.
Do not try to deceive others (Matt. v.&nbsp;19;

The denial of anything does not falsify
it. If a man has swallowed poison, his adopting
an opinion that it cannot kill him, contributes
nothing to his safety; and it is awful

will not hide you for ever in the grave.
Your disbelieving a day of retribution, will
not keep you from appearing before God.

<p class="bq">v.&nbsp;22. <i>Woe unto them that are mighty to drink wine, and men of strength to mingle
strong drink.</i></p>

<p>There are certain vices which the
customs of certain countries seem to
place only in the number of human
infirmities; and yet, if we look at
their effects, we shall see that really
they are as black as those sins which
God and man visits with the severest
punishments. <b>I.&nbsp;The drunkard&rsquo;s
excuses,</b> by which he endeavours to
defend or palliate his crime. 1.&nbsp;<i>Good
fellowship.</i> But can friendship be
founded on vice? especially on a vice
which notoriously impairs the memory
and the sense of obligation, leads to the
betrayal of secrets, and stirs up strife
and contention? Instead of promoting
conversation it destroys it by destroying
the very capability of communicating
rational and agreeable
thoughts. The drunkard may make
his company merry, but they laugh
at, not with, him, and merely because
they are delighted with the sight of
one even sillier than themselves.
2.&nbsp;<i>&ldquo;It drowns care.&rdquo;</i> But the drunkard&rsquo;s
care must arise either from his
ill state of health, the unfortunate
posture of his worldly affairs, or the
stings of his guilty conscience; and, in
either case, his temporary oblivion is
purchased at the cost of an aggravation
of the evils which cause him to desire
it. To drink to drown remorse is
especially absurd, for all that the
drunkard can expect from this course
is the benefit of travelling some part
of the road to eternal misery with his
eyes covered. 3.&nbsp;The drunkard has
other excuses: he says that he is so
exposed to company and business, that
he cannot avoid drinking to excess, or
that he is of so easy and flexible a
temper, that he cannot resist the
importunities of his friends, as he calls
them. Thus he is for softening his vice
into a sort of virtue, and calling that
good nature, which his creditor calls
villany, and his family cruelty. <b>II.&nbsp;The
drunkard&rsquo;s woe.</b> This is made
up of the miserable effects, as well
temporal as spiritual, of his favourite
vice. 1.&nbsp;Poverty. 2.&nbsp;Contempt. 3.&nbsp;Ill-health.
4.&nbsp;An untimely death.
Consider, too, the spiritual evils that
spring from and punish the vice of
drunkenness. 1.&nbsp;The understanding
is depraved and darkened. 2.&nbsp;The
will is enfeebled and dethroned. 3.&nbsp;The
passions are inflamed and rendered
ungovernable. 4.&nbsp;Regard for men
and reverence for God are destroyed.
Drunkenness travels with a whole
train of other vices, and requires the
whole width of the broad way to give
it room. Where its journey is to end,
we know; so that if the guilt and
misery which attend it here, be not
enough, there, at least, the drunkard,
having opened his eyes and recovered
the use of his reason, will perceive the
truth of the text.&mdash;<i>Skelton, in Clapham&rsquo;s

<p>How base a price dost thou set upon thy

so much as a cup of drink for them? The
smallness of the thing showeth the smallness
of thy love to God, and the smallness of thy
regard to His Word and to thy soul. Is that
loving God as God, when thou lovest a cup of
drink better? Art thou not ashamed of thy
hypocrisy, when thou sayest thou lovest God
above all, when thou lovest Him not so well
as thy wine and ale? Surely he that loveth
Him not above ale, loveth Him not above all!
Thy choice showeth what thou loveth best,
more certainly than thy tongue doth. It is
the dish that a man greedily eateth of that he
loveth, and not that which he commendeth
but will not meddle with. God trieth men&rsquo;s
love to Him, by their keeping His commandments.
It was the aggravation of the first sin,
that they would not deny so small a thing as
the forbidden fruit, in obedience to God!
And so it is of thine, that wilt not leave a
forbidden cup for Him! O miserable wretch!
dost thou not know thou canst not be Christ&rsquo;s
disciple, if thou forsake not all for Him, and
hate not even thy life in comparison of Him,
and wouldst not rather die than forsake Him!
And art thou like to lay down thy life for
Him that wilt not leave a cup of drink for
Him? Canst thou burn at a stake for Him,
that canst not leave an alehouse, or vain company,

<p class="bq">v.&nbsp;22. <i>Woe unto them that are mighty to drink wine, and men of strength to mingle
strong drink.</i></p>

<p>Human depravity and iniquity have
existed in all ages and countries. The
vices flowing therefrom have been
much the same&mdash;selfishness, pride,
sensualism, oppression, drunkenness.
Alcohol acting directly on the brain, the
seat of the mind, tends not only to
derange, but to enfeeble and pervert,
and produces moral obliquity, moral infatuation,
and intensified delusion. All
sorts of deceits are the consequence.
Observe&mdash;I.&nbsp;<span class="smcap">The characters introduced</span>
(ver. 22). Observe also verses
11 and 12. In the last verses there is
reference to confirmed drunkards, daily,
early, and late; the sensual debauchees&mdash;their
ignorance, want of thought and
reflection. In the text, notorious
drinkers, bold, impudent wager-layers,
boasters, &amp;c., and those who have got
the victory over the usual drinks, and
now make them stronger to meet the
cravings of appetite and to keep up
the excitement. Observe, this is the
great peril of moderate drinking. It
creates the appetite, it increases the
appetite; last of all, it gives the appetite
the control, and the man or woman
becomes the slave and the victim.</p>

<p>II. <span class="smcap">The infatuation portrayed</span>&mdash;by
1.&nbsp;<i>Giving false names to things</i>
(ver. 20). Call (1)&nbsp;evil good:
drinks (poisons) are called beverages;
evil things made by men are called
God&rsquo;s good creatures. And so they
call (2)&nbsp;good evil; despise the really
good and safe; pour contempt on
water and safe fluids, and treat them
as evil or worthless. How drinks have
secured the most alluring titles&mdash;strong
<span class="pagenum" id="p128">[p.&nbsp;128]</span>
cordials, dew, &amp;c., generous. Not only
false names, but 2.&nbsp;<i>False qualities</i> (ver.
20), &ldquo;Bitter for sweet.&rdquo; Now intoxicating
drinks are not sweet or palatable
to the natural taste; they blister
the mouth of children; do burn the
delicate nerves of the stomach; the
tongue and lips have to be trained,
drilled, hardened. Observe, they call
sweet bitter; things really so are
treated as insipid. Ask the spirit-drinker
to taste milk or tea, or water, and
see how his poisoned taste revolts, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Then there is presented to us&mdash;3.&nbsp;<i>Infatuated
results.</i> Put darkness for
light; men plead and say these drinks&mdash;(1)&nbsp;Brighten
the intellect. How
false! See the bloated faces, the
diseased eyes, the sensual expression,
the stupid look, the stupor. The light
is artificial, momentary, false&mdash;no
better than the effects of certain gases
or deadly stimulants, as opium, Indian
hemp, &amp;c. But they refer to men, to
Burns, Pitt, Sheridan, and other drinking
wits. But they were intellectually
great in spite, &amp;c. Look at Milton,
Sir Isaac Newton; look at the inspired
prophets&mdash;the seraphic Isaiah, the
writer of the text. (2)&nbsp;They who drink
say their drinks lighten the heart, give
social joyousness. Right; but is it not
sensual, spurious, evanescent, ends in
darkness? So they put light for darkness.
The calm, equable sobriety of
soul they called dulness, darkness.
But this is real, abiding, and rational.
So, both in name and quality, and in
effects, they call &ldquo;evil good,&rdquo; &amp;c.</p>

<p>III. <span class="smcap">The woes denounced.</span> 1.&nbsp;<i>There
is the woe of physical consequence.</i> The
seed and the harvest, the poisons and
their effects, fire, deranged stomach,
plague, diseased liver, excited heart,
fevered brain, all tending to a host
of maladies, shortened life, and an
early grave. There is&mdash;2.&nbsp;<i>Woe of a
distracted mind.</i> Reason beclouded;
reflection, perception, all marred. The
guiding star eclipsed, the light obscured
with darkness. There is the&mdash;3.&nbsp;<i>Woe
of moral defects.</i> The man is vitiated,
made worse and worse; his affections,
his desires, his conscience, his heart,
the whole soul. There is&mdash;4.&nbsp;<i>The woe
of perverted powers.</i> Gifts, talents, &amp;c.,
all poisoned; influence deadly; the
man a curse&mdash;a curse to all. 5.&nbsp;<i>The
woe of God&rsquo;s malediction.</i> God&rsquo;s woe,
His displeasure, His threatening, His
curse; this is written in both volumes
of the Scriptures&mdash;in frightful representation,

<p class="bq">v.&nbsp;24. <i>Therefore as the fire devoureth the stubble, and the flame consumeth the chaff,
so their root shall be as rottenness, and their blossom shall go up as dust: because they
have cast away the law of the Lord of hosts, and despised the word of the Holy One
of Israel.</i></p>

<p>Shut God out of the heart, and <i>this</i>
is what it comes to at last. In Jewish
history, we have a commentary on the
judgments announced in the text,
written in fire and blood. We have
here&mdash;<b>I.&nbsp;God&rsquo;s merciful approaches
to the soul.</b> 1.&nbsp;God begins with <i>law.</i>
In the present day there is a nervous
dread of law, as if it were the offspring
of severity rather than of <span class="wsnw">grace.<a id="o103_fna1" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#o103_fn1">[1]</a></span>
But law checks, rectifies, and blesses
in innumerable ways (Ps. xix.&nbsp;7&ndash;11;
cxix.&nbsp;105, &amp;c). 2.&nbsp;To His law, He
adds His <i>word;</i> His &ldquo;word&rdquo; of persuasion,
exhortation, promise, and especially
the great &ldquo;word&rdquo; of the Gospel.
<b>II.&nbsp;God&rsquo;s merciful approaches rejected.</b>
&ldquo;They have cast away the law,&rdquo; &amp;c.
<span class="pagenum" id="p129">[p.&nbsp;129]</span>
Man meets God&rsquo;s law with resistance,
His love with contempt. <b>III.&nbsp;God&rsquo;s
merciful approaches giving place to
indignation and wrath.</b> &ldquo;Therefore
as the fire devoureth,&rdquo; &amp;c. Law being
resisted, and love despised, things
cannot be as they were before; one of
two things must happen&mdash;there must
be either pardon or punishment. If
pardon be rejected, only punishment
remains. The images under which
this is set forth in the text are most
alarming. They show&mdash;1.&nbsp;<i>That at last
God&rsquo;s anger strikes at the root of our being</i>&mdash;at
the very substance of our life.
The wrath of man at the worst rages
only on the surface, but God strikes at
the root (Luke xii.&nbsp;4; Matt. x.&nbsp;28).
2.&nbsp;<i>God&rsquo;s anger smites the blossom of our
being.</i> All that constitutes the show,
promise, and pride of our life, is
scattered like dust. 3.&nbsp;<i>When God smites
in anger, He smites suddenly and swiftly,</i>
&ldquo;as the fire devoureth the stubble, and
the flame consumeth the chaff.&rdquo; 4.&nbsp;<i>When
God smites in anger, man can offer
no resistance.</i> What power to resist a
hurricane has a tree whose roots are
not only rotten, but &ldquo;rottenness&rdquo;?
How can the stubble withstand the
fire, or the chaff defend itself against
tongues of flame?&mdash;<i>J.&nbsp;R. Wood.</i></p>

The spring of the law is love. With its
&ldquo;Thou shalt not do this,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Thou shalt not
do that,&rdquo; the law presents rather an ungracious
aspect. We like ill to be bidden, but worse to
be forbidden. But does love never forbid? A
mother, does she never forbid her child; but,
on the contrary, indulge every caprice and
grant all his wishes? How disastrous the fate,
and brief the life, of a child denied nothing,
indulged in everything, allowed to play with
fire, or fire-arms; to devour the painted but
poisonous fruit&mdash;to bathe where the tide runs
like a racehorse or the river rushes roaring
into the black, swirling pool. And he who frets
against the restraints of God&rsquo;s holy law because
it forbids this and the other thing, is no
wiser than the infant who weeps, and screams,
and struggles, and perhaps beats the kind
bosom that nurses it, because its mother has
snatched a knife from its foolish hands.&mdash;<i>Guthrie.</i></p></div>

<h3 class="tdc" id="o104"><span class="smcap">The Doom of Impenitent Israel.</span></h3>

<p class="bq">v.&nbsp;24&ndash;30. <i>Therefore as the fire devoureth, &amp;c.</i></p>

<p>In this threatening, fulfilled in the
utter destruction of Israel by Assyria,
we find illustrations of the following
facts.&mdash;I.&nbsp;That <i>the Lord is a God of
judgment as well as of</i>
<span class="wsnw"><i>mercy</i>.<a id="o104_fna1" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#o104_fn1">[1]</a></span>
The mercy of God has been exemplified
in His long forbearance with sinful
Israel: His justice was manifested in
the utter destruction that came upon
Israel when it was seen that that
forbearance had been shown in vain.
God is still as He revealed Himself
in His Word and in His actual dealings
with His people. It is utterly
vain for us to frame for ourselves
an ideal God in whose character
the sternest justice has no place. II.&nbsp;That
<i>we can sustain no relation to
God which will render it safe for us
to break His commandments, or exempt
us from the consequences of wrong-doing</i>
(ver. 25. Compare ver. 5; Amos iii.&nbsp;2).
III.&nbsp;That <i>all the forces of the
universe are at God&rsquo;s disposal for the
execution of His purposes.</i> Appalling is
the variety of the scourges and swords
that lie ready to His hand for the
chastisement of the <span class="wsnw">rebellious,<a id="o104_fna2" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#o104_fn2">[2]</a></span>
and for the destruction of the incorrigible!
IV.&nbsp;That <i>in addressing Himself
to the work of judgment, God is
moved by the highest moral considerations.</i>
&ldquo;Because they have cast away
the <i>law</i> of the Lord of hosts, and
despised the <i>word</i> of the Holy One
of Israel; <i>therefore</i> is the anger of
the Lord kindled against His people.&rdquo;
In His wrath, as well as in His love,
He is holy: in neither is there any
caprice. V.&nbsp;That <i>consequently God will
not pause in His work of judgment out of
any weak regard to the mere sufferings of
wrong-doers.</i> It is against sin that His
anger burns, and while sin endures
the fires of His wrath will continue to
flame. Eternal punishment! For impenitent
transgressors there is woe
upon woe, and no severity of suffering
that they may endure abates the anger
of the Lord against them. There is
<span class="pagenum" id="p130">[p.&nbsp;130]</span>
no such thing as salvation by personal
suffering. See how all this is expressed
in our text from beginning to
end.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">General Conclusion.</span>&mdash;&ldquo;It is a
fearful thing to fall into the hands of
the living God.&rdquo; The history of the
Jews since Israel&rsquo;s day is a terrible
comment on this declaration.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Particular Conclusions.</span>&mdash;1. As
sinners, let us bestir ourselves to avert
the consequences of our transgressions
by a timely and genuine repentance
(ch. lv.&nbsp;6, 7; Hosea xiv.&nbsp;1&ndash;4, &amp;c.) 2.&nbsp;Having
obtained mercy, let us be in
the fear of the Lord all the day long
(John v.&nbsp;14). 3.&nbsp;For our guidance in
life, let us keep constantly before us
the Biblical presentation of God, as
a God of justice and mercy;&mdash;of
justice, that we may be restrained from
transgression; of mercy, that there
may grow up in our hearts that
love for Him which will cause us to
find our highest joy in doing His
will.</p>

As for example, <i>conscience,</i> the awakening
of which Henry Smith has thus depicted:&mdash;&ldquo;There
is a warning conscience and a gnawing
conscience. The warning comes before
sin; the gnawing conscience follows after sin.
The warning conscience is often lulled asleep,
but the gnawing conscience wakes her again.
If there be any hell in this world, they who
feel the worm of conscience gnawing on their
hearts may truly say that they have felt the
torments of hell. Who can express that man&rsquo;s
horror but himself? Nay, what horrors are
those which he cannot express himself! Sorrows
are met in his soul as at a feast; and fear,
thought, and anguish divide the soul between
them. All the furies of hell leap upon his
heart like a stage. Thought calls to Fear;
Fear whistles to Horror; Horror beckons to
Despair, and says, Come, and help me to torment
this sinner. One says that she comes
from this sin, and another says that she comes
from that sin. So he goes through a thousand
deaths, and cannot die. Irons are laid upon
his body like a prisoner. All his lights are
put out at once. He has no soul fit to be comforted.
Thus he lives as it were upon the
rack, and says that he bears the world upon
his shoulders, and that no man suffers that
which he suffers. So let him lie, says God,
without ease, until he confess and repent and
call for mercy.&rdquo;</p></div>

<h3 class="tdc" id="o105"><span class="smcap">Cords and Cart-Ropes.</span></h3>

<p class="bq">v.&nbsp;18. <i>Woe unto them that draw iniquity with cords of vanity, and sin as it were
with a cart-</i><span class="wsnw"><i>rope.</i><a id="o105_fna1" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#o105_fn1">[1]</a></span></p>

<p>There is a certain oddity and grotesqueness
in these words as they stand.
It disappears as soon as we perceive
that we have here an instance of
Hebrew parallelism. (Compare chap.
i.&nbsp;18.) <i>&ldquo;Sin&rdquo;</i> is a noun, not a verb, and
is a synonym for iniquity; to sin men
yoke themselves as it were with
&ldquo;cords of vanity&rdquo; or as with &ldquo;a cart-rope.&rdquo;
<i>&ldquo;Cords of vanity&rdquo;</i> are such as
have no substance in them, that will
not stand any real strain; &ldquo;a cart-rope&rdquo;
will stand an immense strain.
Where, then, is the propriety of describing
that by which the sinner
binds himself to his sin by such
opposite terms? In this, that in the
first clause these bands are regarded
from the point of view of a sound
judgment, in the second from the point
of view of the sinner&rsquo;s experience.
Subjected to a real examination they
are seen to be of no strength at all,
and yet they suffice to bind the sinner
to his sin as thoroughly as if they
were strong as &ldquo;a cart-rope.&rdquo;</p>

<p>What are these &ldquo;cords of vanity&rdquo;?
They are false ideas&mdash;of God, of truth,
of duty. This is plain from verse 19,
which is an <i>explanation</i> of this one.
There we have an illustrative case.
Certain men are represented as bound
to their iniquity by the false idea that
God will not fulfil His threatenings
against iniquity.</p>

<p>Our text furnishes the solution of
a mystery which often perplexes us in
daily life. We see men cleaving to
ruinous iniquities, and cleaving to
them in spite of the remonstrances
and entreaties of their friends and of
God&rsquo;s servants. We who have felt
<span class="pagenum" id="p131">[p.&nbsp;131]</span>
&ldquo;the powers of the world to come&rdquo;
wonder that men do not repent and
believe, and so escape from &ldquo;the wrath
to come.&rdquo; Here is the explanation:
they are bound to their ungodly practices
as it were with a cart-rope; and
yet they are just enslaved by what,
when rightly tested, are only cords of
vanity. They are like a horse tied to
a post by a bridle-rein: it could snap
the rein in an instant, but it does not
attempt to do so because it has no
suspicion of the weakness of the rein.
Look at some of the &ldquo;cords of vanity&rdquo;
by which men are bound to their
iniquities; the exposure of their essential
weakness may excite some who
are not fettered and bound to make
an effort to attain to moral freedom.</p>

<p>I. One prevalent &ldquo;cord of vanity&rdquo;
is <i>unbelief in God&rsquo;s threatenings against
iniquity.</i> That God has threatened to
do certain terrible things to impenitent
sinners is admitted, but there
lurks in the sinner&rsquo;s heart the idea
that God is like certain foolish parents
who threaten their children with
punishments which they are much
too good-natured ever to inflict. But
whence did you derive this idea of
God? Certainly not from <i>His Word.</i>
He there distinctly forewarns us, that,
though He is merciful and gracious,
He will &ldquo;by no means clear the guilty&rdquo;
(Ex. xxxiv.&nbsp;7). Not from any intelligent
examination of <i>His dealings in
providence.</i> There neglect or infraction
of law is invariably followed by
punishment. If a whole nation were
to neglect to sow its fields, would
God be too good-natured to permit
it to starve? But if God invariably
punishes men for their infractions of
His material laws, what reason can
we have for hoping that He will not
fulfil His threatenings against those
who despise His spiritual ordinances?
And why should we hope this?
What reverence could we have for,
what trust could we repose in, a God
who did not fulfil His threatenings?
How could we then trust in His
promises? Surely this is a &ldquo;cord
of vanity!&rdquo; and yet how many are
bound by it as if it were &ldquo;a cart-rope&rdquo;!</p>

<p>II. Another cord is the reflection,
<i>&ldquo;We are no worse than others.&rdquo;</i> Men
compare themselves with others, perhaps
even more iniquitous than themselves,
and so arrive at the conclusion
that they are not in any great danger.
They do this even in temporal things,&mdash;<i>e.g.,</i>
in the matter of drainage. The
authorities of a country village or town
will listen with the most complete
indifference to the warnings of a
Government inspector, that they are
inviting an outbreak of fever or
cholera; and the ground of their
indifference is that they know of other
villages or towns as badly drained as
their own. But does <i>that</i> afford them
any protection against the dangers
of which they are warned? Men
act as foolishly in spiritual matters.
Because there are so many sinners
they close their eyes to their own
dangers or sins. Will God be either
unable or afraid to punish transgressors
because they are so numerous?
Surely this also is a &ldquo;cord of vanity;&rdquo;
and yet thousands are bound by it
to their eternal destruction!</p>

<p>III. <i>&ldquo;We shall be able to shake ourselves
loose from our evil habits by and
by.&rdquo;</i> They imagine that they can
repent and reform at any time, and
they are firmly resolved to do so
before death. Perhaps there could
not be found a single sinner who
does not secretly cherish in his breast
wicked Balaam&rsquo;s desire, &ldquo;Let me die
the death of the righteous, and let my
last end be like his!&rdquo; But this idea
that men can repent and reform at
any time is a delusion. As men continue
in sin (1)&nbsp;<i>The power to reform
decays.</i> (2)&nbsp;<i>The desire to reform dies out.</i>
The love of sin takes entire possession
of the man. It enwraps him as ivy
unchecked will enwrap a tree; at
first with no more strength than a
child&rsquo;s finger, in the end with the
strength of a thousand giants. It
is the oldest sinners who cling to
their vices most desperately, who are
bound by them as by cart-ropes.
(3)&nbsp;<i>The opportunities for reform rapidly</i>
<span class="pagenum" id="p132">[p.&nbsp;132]</span>
<i>diminish and often end unexpectedly</i>
(Prov. xxix.&nbsp;1; 1&nbsp;Thess. v.&nbsp;3).</p>

<p>Inquire by what cords of vanity
<i>you</i> are bound. Break them! (Dan.
iv.&nbsp;27.) Look to Jesus, who came
into the world for the very purpose
of setting at liberty them that are
bound.</p>

<p class="bq">vi.&nbsp;1&ndash;12. <i>In the year that King Uzziah died, &amp;c.</i></p>

<p>We have here the history of Isaiah&rsquo;s
call to his great life-work. Perhaps
in a modern biography this chapter
would have been placed first. But
there was wisdom in placing it where
it stands; it was well to give some
insight into the real character of the
men along who Isaiah was called
to labour, for thus we are enabled
more easily to understand the nature
of the mission on which he was
<span class="wsnw">sent.<a id="o106_fna1" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#o106_fn1">[1]</a></span>
Studying this chapter as a
history of the prophet&rsquo;s call, I learn&mdash;</p>

<p><b>I. That a threefold spiritual preparation
is needed for effective service
of</b> <span class="wsnw"><b>God.</b><a id="o106_fna2" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#o106_fn2">[2]</a></span>
It is generally admitted
that some kind of preparation is
needed, <i>e.g.,</i> for the ministry of the
Gospel; but it is not generally recognised
that a merely professional preparation
is of no avail whatever. A
man may pass through the whole
routine of college life, both literary
and theological, and yet not be a
prophet of the Lord. Such preparation
is not merely not enough, it is
not even essential. &ldquo;Schools of the
prophets&rdquo; may exist without sending
forth a single prophet, and God calls
many prophets who have never been
inside a school door. This is true of
every kind and form of God&rsquo;s service,
<i>e.g.,</i> the Sunday-school, the home,
Christian literature. In every case
a threefold spiritual preparation is
necessary. Without it we may pretend
to be God&rsquo;s servants; but the disguise
will always be imperfect, and we shall
always be betraying what we really
are. Even the old blind Isaacs whom
we deceive will not be sure about us:
we may have on Esau&rsquo;s garments, but
we shall never perfectly imitate Esau&rsquo;s
voice. What, then, is this preparation?
1.&nbsp;<i>A vision of God.</i> Before we
can serve God effectively, we must to
some extent see Him as He is. In all
departments of human activity, knowledge
of the person served is essential
to perfect service. Those who have
never seen an earthly king cannot
serve him as those who are in
daily intercourse with him; their
loyalty is at the most a sentiment, not
a constraining power. The biographies
of God&rsquo;s most eminent servants
in all ages make it plain that the first
and indispensable state in preparation
for His service is a vision of God
Himself&mdash;a revelation of His majesty
and holiness (vers. 1&ndash;4). 2.&nbsp;What a
man needs before he can effectively
serve God is <i>a vision of himself.</i> The
great hindrance of such service is self-satisfaction
and self-sufficiency. But
when a man really sees God as He is,
he straightway sees himself as he is
(ver. 5). Job&rsquo;s experience (Job xlii.&nbsp;5, 6)
Peter&rsquo;s experience (Luke v.&nbsp;8).
He sees himself to be utterly unfit
and unable to serve God, and so
attains to the second indispensable
qualification for such service (Eph. iii.&nbsp;8;
1&nbsp;Cor. xv.&nbsp;9, &amp;c.) 3.&nbsp;The third
thing which a man needs before he
can effectively serve God is <i>participation
in God&rsquo;s salvation.</i> This is a rule
that needs to be stated with wisdom.
As a matter of fact, God has used the
ministry of unconverted men. Such
men may be guide-posts, though not
guides. How much better to be a
guide! How much more useful is
a guide! But we cannot thus serve
our generation unless we have been
made a partaker of God&rsquo;s salvation.
By a sanctifying process,&mdash;a process
involving in some cases terrible pain
(vers. 6, 7),&mdash;we must have been made
&ldquo;separate from sinners.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="p133">[p.&nbsp;133]</span>
<b>II. Those who have undergone this
preparation will devote themselves
unreservedly to God&rsquo;s service.</b> 1.&nbsp;<i>There
will spring up spontaneously within
them a desire to serve God.</i> They will
not need to be pressed into this
service; they will volunteer (ver. 8).
2.&nbsp;<i>They will not be deterred by the difficulty
or painfulness of the service to which
they are called.</i> It was a hard and
distasteful service that was demanded
of Isaiah&mdash;to prophesy to an unbelieving
and scoffing generation (ch. v.&nbsp;18, 19);
to enter upon a ministry that
would leave men worse than it found
them (vers. 9, 10). Nor was this
ministry to be brief; it was to be
prolonged through many years (vers.
11, 12). Note: in sending Isaiah on
such a ministry there was nothing
inconsistent with the Divine righteousness
or goodness. God&rsquo;s truth must
be proclaimed, whether men will heed
or reject it; and the inevitable effect
of such proclamation of the truth is to
render those who reject it more stupid
and wicked than they were before
(2&nbsp;Cor. ii.&nbsp;16; John ix.&nbsp;39). But,
painful as it was, Isaiah did not
shrink from it. Nor do any who have
passed through such a preparation as
his. They do not ask concerning a
work or duty, &ldquo;Is it easy?&rdquo; &ldquo;Is it
pleasant?&rdquo; but, &ldquo;Does God call me to
it?&rdquo; Paul: (Acts xxi.&nbsp;13).</p>

<p><b>III. There is great encouragement
for those who have unreservedly
devoted themselves to the service of
God.</b> 1.&nbsp;<i>What God demands from them
is not success, but faithfulness.</i> He did
not require Isaiah to convert his
fellow-countrymen, but to prophesy
to them faithfully. There his responsibility
began and ended. So is
it with preachers, teachers, and priests
to-day. Men measure by success, but
God by faithfulness. What a difference
is the result, <i>e.g.,</i> in such a case
as that of Carey, who laboured for
years without making one convert!
or in such a case as Isaiah&rsquo;s! 2.&nbsp;<i>No
faithful servant of God will ever labour
without some success.</i> Isaiah was not
to toil altogether in vain. There was
to be a wide-spread apostacy of his
countrymen, but not a universal apostacy;
a small remnant would still
cleave to the Lord (ver. 13); and
doubtless Isaiah&rsquo;s ministry did much
to keep them in the paths of righteousness.
So is it with us; much of
our seed may be wasted, but not all of
it (Ps. cxxvi.&nbsp;6; 1&nbsp;Cor. xv.&nbsp;58).</p>

<div class="footnote" id="o106_fn1"><p><a href="#o106_fna1"><span class="label">[1]</span></a>
This vision evidently contains the designation
of Isaiah to his work as a prophet. It
does not follow that he may not himself have
put his book together in the form, or nearly
in the form, in which we have received it.
The early chapters as they describe the state of
the people, not at one particular moment but
through a course of years, announcing the
punishments which must follow from that
state with the blessings which could come out
of them, are a living index to the subsequent
prophecies and history. The place which they
occupy, supposing it was assigned by Isaiah,
cannot hinder us from accepting his own express
words as a proof, that the year in which
King Uzziah dies was the critical year of his
life, that which explained to him why he was
sent into the world and what task he had to
perform in it.&mdash;<i>F.&nbsp;D. Maurice.</i></p></div>

<div class="footnote" id="o106_fn2"><p><a href="#o106_fna2"><span class="label">[2]</span></a>
Once for all must he who was to be a
prophet have become absolutely certain of the
true relation of the world and Jehovah,&mdash;must
have beheld, as in a distinct form, the sublime
and holy character of Jehovah, and felt that
he was directed by Him alone; once for all
must he have recognised the Divine power of
truth against the whole world, and himself as
living and moving in it alone; once for all
must he have entered, with the effectual energy
and act of his whole inner being, into the
counsels of God, and found himself for ever
bound by them, and endowed by these bonds
with true power and freedom:&mdash;this was the
first condition and the true beginning of all
the work of the prophet, the holy consecration
and the inner call, without which none can
become a true prophet.&mdash;<i>Ewald.</i></p></div>

<span class="pagenum" id="p134">[p.&nbsp;134]</span>
Temple (2&nbsp;Chron. xxvi.&nbsp;16&ndash;21); his
son and successor was Jotham, the
only king of the house of Judah whose
character has not one dishonouring
blot; was it not appropriate that,
when the disobedient king was removed,
and a king had succeeded
him, there should have been this
glorious revelation of the King of
kings&mdash;not merely as a preparation of
the prophet for his mission, but as
an encouragement to the monarch to
persevere in his loyalty towards God
and His truth?</p>

<p>That which was granted to the
Prophet was <i>a vision of the Triune God.</i>
Proofs: ver. 3, which shows the plurality
of persons in the Divine unity;
John xii.&nbsp;41, where it is asserted that
that which the prophet saw was the
glory of Christ; Acts xxviii.&nbsp;25, where
it is asserted that the voice which the
prophet heard was the voice of the
Holy Ghost; ver. 3, the threefold repetition
of &ldquo;holy.&rdquo; I purpose, therefore,
to make some observations on this
important subject of the Trinity.</p>

<p><b>I. The doctrine of the Trinity has
been believed by the Church of Christ
in all ages.</b> This is at least a presumption
that it is taught in Scripture,
successive generations of devout men
could scarcely have been mistaken on
such a vital point.</p>

<p><b>II. This doctrine of the Trinity
underlies the whole Bible, and is inextricably
interwoven with its fabric
and structure.</b> The Old Testament
testifies to the Divine unity, as contrasted
with the polytheism which
prevailed among heathen nations;
the Gospels record the manifestation
of the Incarnate Son of God; the Acts
of the Apostles and the Epistles set
forth the work of the Third Person in
the Church. There is direct testimony
to this doctrine, such as Matt.
xxviii.&nbsp;19, 2&nbsp;Cor. xiii.&nbsp;14. But just as
circumstantial evidence when it is clear
and complete is even more satisfactory
and decisive than the very best direct
testimony, still more valuable is the
indirect testimony to this doctrine
underlying the whole Bible; like a
threefold cord, it runs through the
whole book, and binds the whole of
Divine revelation together.</p>

<p><b>III. The doctrine of the Trinity,
while it is clearly taught in Scripture,
is mysterious and inexplicable.</b> We
can no more comprehend it with the
unaided human understanding than
by uplifting the fingers we can touch
the starry <span class="wsnw">firmament.<a id="o107_fna1" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#o107_fn1">[1]</a></span>
This is no
reason for refusing to accept <span class="wsnw">it,<a id="o107_fna2" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#o107_fn2">[2]</a></span> for
we accept many other facts which we
cannot explain (we cannot explain
even the familiar fact of <i>sight</i>), but it
is a reason for not insisting dogmatically
that other men should accept
our explanation of it.</p>

<p>As we cannot stay to consider the
effect of the vision upon the mind of
the prophet, I shall conclude with
just three words of practical application
of the doctrine itself. 1.&nbsp;<i>It is bound
up with our duty to God.</i> We are bound
to accept it, because He has revealed
it; and accepting it, we are bound
to yield to Father, Son and Holy
Ghost the homage and love of our
souls. 2.&nbsp;<i>It is bound up with our hope
of salvation.</i> If it is not true that the
Everlasting Son came forth from the
bosom of the Father, and took upon
Him to deliver man; and if it is not
true that the Holy Spirit proceeding
from the Father and the Son raises
men from the death of sin to the life
of righteousness, and restamps upon
their souls the lost lineaments of our
Maker&rsquo;s image, what foundation is
there left for our hope of everlasting
life? 3.&nbsp;<i>It is bound up with the fulness
of the Gospel blessings.</i> These are all
summed upon the Apostolic benediction,
2&nbsp;Cor. xiii.&nbsp;14. If <i>these</i> be ours,
we &ldquo;have all and abound.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>R.&nbsp;W.
Forrest</i> (<i>Christian World Pulpit,</i> i.&nbsp;492).</p>

<p><b>I. Earthly powers fade and perish,
but the Eternal Power that uses them
all lives on</b> (ver. 1). Comfort here,
when a great king or statesman is taken
away from the head of a nation; when
a great leader of an arduous reformatory
movement, such as Luther, is laid
low; when an eloquent preacher or
wise pastor is summoned to his rest;
or even when the head of a household
is cut off just when his family most
need his care. He who has wrought
by their instrumentality can work
without it (Ps. lxviii.&nbsp;5, &amp;c.) <b>II.&nbsp;In
God&rsquo;s temples there is room only for
God.</b> &ldquo;His train filled the Temple.&rdquo;
Ahaz could build in the courts of the
Lord&rsquo;s house an altar to the god of
Damascus (2&nbsp;Kings xvi.&nbsp;10&ndash;16), but
he could not worship two gods there,
for the only living and true God departed
when His sanctuary was thus
profaned. God will have all, or none
(Isa. xlii.&nbsp;8). All His earthly temples
must be counterparts of the one heavenly
temple, where He reigns alone.
In no church will God divide His empire
with the State or with popular opinion:
we <i>must</i> choose between Him and all
other authorities. In no heart will
He reign along with any other principle
or passion (Matt. vi.&nbsp;24). <b>III.&nbsp;Until
we reach the land where there
is no temple, we cannot see God as He</b>
<span class="wsnw"><b>is.</b><a id="o108_fna2" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#o108_fn2">[2]</a></span>
To Isaiah a vision of God was
granted, and yet it was but a symbolic
vision. He saw a throne, and
on it seated a Being of indescribable
majesty; but who imagines that he
saw God as He is? Does God sit on
a throne, after the fashion of kings
such as Uzziah, who fade and die?
The vision was a condescension to the
human faculties of the seer, and served
its purpose, that of impressing upon
him the majesty and holiness of the
Most High. And he tells us more of
the ministers who surround the throne
than of its Occupant! Him no words
can describe; of Him no absolute disclosure
is now possible; He can but
give us revelations&mdash;visions&mdash;administrations
of Himself. And this He has
done. 1.&nbsp;<i>In nature.</i> The purpose of
the manifold and wondrous universe is
not accomplished if we look only at the
creation, and do not discern in it veils
not thickly hiding, but helping to reveal
the Creator (Rom. i.&nbsp;19, <span class="wsnw">20).<a id="o108_fna3" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#o108_fn3">[3]</a></span>
2.&nbsp;<i>In Providence.</i> The manner in which
the world is governed is, to the man
who studies it comprehensively, earnestly,
and reverently, a revelation of
the character of the Ruler. 3.&nbsp;<i>In His
Word.</i> That man miserably mistakes,
who studies the Bible as anything less
than a many-sided disclosure of God.
4.&nbsp;<i>In</i>
<span class="wsnw"><i>Christ:</i><a id="o108_fna4" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#o108_fn4">[4]</a></span>
a familiar thought this,
yet how seldom do we enter into its
depths! We do not worship an unknown
God, yet we cannot see Him
as He is until we have entered into
that light which is inaccessible and
which no mortal can approach unto,
until we have been ourselves transformed
into &ldquo;children of light,&rdquo; and
so rendered capable of looking on &ldquo;the
Father of lights.&rdquo; <b>IV.&nbsp;Those to whom
He reveals Himself most fully are most
humble, and those whom He most exalts
are most ready to serve.</b> We have both
these truths illustrated in the seraphim
and in Isaiah.</p>

The scene of the Vision is the Temple,
and its features will have the same
whether we suppose them to have risen before
Isaiah&rsquo;s imagination while he was absent from
the spot, in the solitude of his chamber or his
house-top, or assume (as I myself prefer to do),
that he was actually praying in the Temple at
the time.</p>

<p>Though it is unlikely that any of the successors
to what was but a small remnant of
Solomon&rsquo;s kingdom perfectly restored the Temple
after it was deprived of its original splendour
by Shishak in the reign of Rehoboam, yet
we see the worthier princes from time to time
repairing the structure when it had been suffered
to fall into decay, and replacing, as far
as they could, the treasures and the costly
decorations of which it was repeatedly despoiled
to buy off foreign invaders; and probably
there was no period in which the restoration
would be more complete than in the reign
of Uzziah, who in his power, wealth, and magnificence,
came nearer than any other to Solomon.
As there will be much more of fact
than of fancy in the picture, if, for the clearer
understanding of the scene of the vision, we
<span class="pagenum" id="p136">[p.&nbsp;136]</span>
figure to ourselves the youthful prophet in his
rough hair or woollen garment (probably not
unlike that of the Capuchin friar as we now
see him in the streets or churches of Rome),
going up to the Temple to worship;&mdash;and if
we look with him at the Temple as, at the end
of 300 years from its building, it must have
presented itself to his eyes, with its ample
courts, and colonnades, and porch, and its
holy house, and holy of holies, well-proportioned,
and of the most elaborate workmanship,
though rather massive than large according
to our notions. As he crossed the variegated
pavement of &ldquo;the great court of the congregation,&rdquo;
and stopped&mdash;for we have no reason to
suppose him a Levite&mdash;at the entrance to the
inner, or <span class="wsnw">&ldquo;priests&rsquo;&thinsp;&rdquo;</span> court, on each hand would
rise one of the tall pillars which Solomon set
up in token that the kingdom was constituted
by Jehovah, and would be upheld by His might
(1&nbsp;Kings vii.&nbsp;21; 2&nbsp;Chron. iii.&nbsp;17), and which,
once of &ldquo;bright brass,&rdquo; but now mellowed
into bronze, had their square capitals richly
wreathed with molten lilies, chain-work, and
pomegranates; before him, resting on the back
of the twelve oxen, and cast like them in brass,
would appear the &ldquo;molten sea,&rdquo; a basin of
thirty cubits in circumference, and containing
two or three thousand <i>baths</i> of water, its
brim wrought &ldquo;like the brim of a cup with
flowers of lilies,&rdquo; and under these a double row
of ornamental knobs; while on each side stood
five smaller lavers, the bases of which rested
on wheels, and were most elaborately ornamented
with oxen, lions, cherubims, and palm-trees
engraved upon them; and beyond these
again he would see the great brazen altar of
burnt-offering, with its never-extinguished fire;
and overhead the roof of thick cedar beams
resting on rows of columns. These were the
courts of the palace of the Divine King of Israel,
for the reception of His subjects and His ministers.
[Compare the description of Solomon&rsquo;s
own house, which besides its inner porch had
another where he sat to judge the people, 1&nbsp;Kings
vii.&nbsp;7. The arrangement of the Temple
is plainly that of a palace.] The house itself
again consisted of two parts, the outer of which,
the holy place, was accessible to those priests
who were in immediate attendance on their
unseen Sovereign, while the inner, or holiest
place, was the very presence-chamber of the
Monarch who dwelt &ldquo;between the cherubims,&rdquo;
which spread their golden wings over the ark
containing the covenant He had vouchsafed to
enter into with His people, and itself forming
a &ldquo;mercy-seat,&rdquo; where was &ldquo;the place of His
throne and the place of the sole of His feet.&rdquo;
In the position which I have, following the
requirements of the narrative in the chapter
before us, supposed Isaiah to be placed, he
would see through the open folding-doors of
cypress, carved &ldquo;with cherubims, and palm-trees,
and open flowers,&rdquo; and &ldquo;carved with
gold and upon the carved work,&rdquo; into the holy
place, which he could not enter; and the light
of the golden lamps on either side would show
him the cedar panelling of the walls, carved
with knobs and open flowers, with cherubims
and palm-trees, festooned with chain-work, and
richly gilt; the mosaics of precious stone; the
cypress floor; the altar of incense; the table
with the shew-bread; the censers, tongs, and
other furniture of &ldquo;pure and perfect gold;&rdquo;
and before the doorway to the further end,
and not concealed by the open leaves of the
olive-wood doors (carved and gilded like the
others), would be distinguishable the folds of
the vail &ldquo;of blue, and purple, and crimson,
and fine linen,&rdquo; embroidered with cherubims.
In the East the closed vail, or <i>purdah,</i> declares
the presence and secures the privacy of the
monarch, into which no man may intrude and
live; and in the Temple at Jerusalem it was
the symbol of the awful presence and unapproachable
majesty of the King Jehovah, Lord
of hosts.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Perhaps on this occasion, or
certainly on many others, Isaiah had been joining
in the public daily sacrifice and worship,
and had afterwards brought his own free-will
offering&mdash;a bullock or a lamb without blemish.
Such an offering, the symbol of his dedication
of himself to Jehovah&rsquo;s service, would be the
natural expression of his earnest desire for
some token that at last it was permitted him
to enter on the actual functions of the prophetic
office for which he had been so long
preparing; and that this vision was the answer
to such beautiful prayerful desire&mdash;itself an
inspiration from on high&mdash;we may well believe.&mdash;<i>Strachey.</i></p>

<p>Some of you may have been watching a near
and beautiful landscape in the land of mountains
and eternal snows, till you have been exhausted
by its very richness, and till the distant
hills which bounded it have seemed, you knew
not why, to limit and contract the view,&mdash;and
then a veil has been withdrawn, and new hills
not looking as if they belonged to this earth,
yet given another character to all that does
belong to it, have unfolded themselves before
you. This is an imperfect, very imperfect,
likeness (yet it is one), of that revelation which
must have been made to the inner eye of the
prophet when he saw another throne than the
throne of the house of David, another king
than Uzziah or Jotham, another train than that
of priests or minstrels in the Temple, other
winged forms than those golden ones which
overshadowed the mercy-seat. Each object was
the counterpart of one that was then or had
been at some time before his bodily eyes.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
The symbols and service of the Temple were not,
as priests and people often thought, an earthly
machinery for scaling a distant heaven; they
were witnesses of a Heaven nigh at hand, of
a God dwelling in the midst of His people, of
His being surrounded by spirits which do His
pleasure, hearkening to the voice of His words.&mdash;<i>F.&nbsp;D. Maurice.</i></p></div>

<span class="wsnw"><i>&amp;c.</i><a id="o109_fna1" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#o109_fn1">[1]</a></span></p>

<p>Behold, in these temple scenes, both
what the Lord your God is, and what
He requires from you.</p>

<p><b>I.</b> The first of these temple scenes
presents to our view <b>the majesty of
God:</b> &ldquo;I saw the Lord sitting upon a
throne, high, and lifted up.&rdquo; One of
the first and most important truths
for us to learn is the absolute rule of
God&mdash;over nature, man, the principalities
of heaven. He sitteth upon His
throne: this is the attitude, 1.&nbsp;Of
<i>supremacy and dignity;</i> He sitteth
while all other beings stand before
Him to receive His commands, bow in
adoration, or are prostrate in abasement.
2.&nbsp;It is the attitude of <i>ease
and perfect</i> <span class="wsnw"><i>security.</i><a id="o109_fna2" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#o109_fn2">[2]</a></span>
But, above
all, mark the place of His throne as
displayed in this wonderful vision.
It stands in the temple; it has been
sprinkled with the blood of propitiation;
it is <i>now</i> the mercy-seat. To
the truly penitent all its terror appears
softened with grace.</p>

<p><b>II.</b> The second of these temple
scenes displays to us <b>the ineffable
and incomprehensible nature of God.</b>
Let not man suppose that he can
by searching find out God, or know
the Almighty unto perfection. This
is scenically, but most impressively,
represented to us in the vision before
us: &ldquo;His train&rdquo;&mdash;the skirts of the
shekinah&mdash;&ldquo;filled the temple,&rdquo; its
fainter rays beaming from the central
blaze in the holiest of all, and irradiating
the more distant objects. But
even that was too much for man, and
it is therefore added, &ldquo;And the house
was filled with smoke;&rdquo; a veil was
thus drawn over what was too bright
and dazzling for mortal vision; and
though God dwelt in the light, yet it
was light involving itself in thick
darkness (Ps. xcvii.&nbsp;2; Ex. xvi.&nbsp;10).
Revelation has not superseded mystery
(Job xxvi.&nbsp;14). As to His dispensations,
we are all still to walk by faith
rather than by sight; and as to the
depths of His nature, rather to adore
than reason. An infinite being is
necessarily incomprehensible by finite
<span class="wsnw">beings;<a id="o109_fna3" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#o109_fn3">[3]</a></span>
He must be mysterious.
If we could fully know God, we must
either be equal to Him, or He must
lose the glory of His nature and come
down to ourselves (1&nbsp;Cor. xiii.&nbsp;9;
Rom. xi.&nbsp;33).</p>

<p><b>III.</b> The third view presented by
this vision is that of <b>the adorable and
awful holiness of God</b> (ver. 3). This is
seen in His titles (Ps. lxxi.&nbsp;22; Deut.
xxxii.&nbsp;4); in His acts; in His law; in
His visible image on earth, His Son
incarnate; in His Gospel; in His judgments;
in the reward of the righteous.</p>

<p><b>IV.</b> In the next scene which the
vision presents we behold <b>a sinful
man convicted and laid prostrate
before this holy God</b> (ver. 5).</p>

<p><b>V.</b> In the final scene we behold <b>a
convicted, self-abased, and penitent
man pardoned and consecrated to the
service of God</b> (ver. 6, 7). What are
we taught by this wondrous representation?
That for guilty men there is
pardon, that for unholy men there is
purification, and that lips once unclean,
but not sanctified, may join in
the hymns of seraphim, and, without
dread, approach to God, and celebrate
the glories even of His holiness. This
we are taught, but not this only; not
merely is the fact, but the manner of
it, brought before us. See, then, the
means. The instrument of purification
is fire; but not any kind of fire,
fire from any place; it is fire from the
altar, the altar where atonement is
made for sin; fire, therefore, both of
Divine origin, and coming to us
through the great Propitiation. We
can be at no loss for an interpretation
of the symbols thus employed. Our
altar is the cross; the propitiatory
sacrifice, the spotless Lamb of God;
by the merit of His death, and the
baptizing fire of His Spirit, and the
<span class="pagenum" id="p138">[p.&nbsp;138]</span>
guilty and polluted pardoned and
sanctified to God.&mdash;<i>Richard Watson:
Works,</i> vol. iv. pp. 143&ndash;153.</p>

<div class="footnote" id="o109_fn1"><p><a href="#o109_fna1"><span class="label">[1]</span></a>
God is invisible; yet in that heavenly
world in which He has His special and eternal
residence He manifests himself in ineffable
glory, dwelling in what the Scriptures call
&ldquo;the light which no man can approach unto.&rdquo;
Of that heavenly world, the tabernacle and
temple were splendid emblems; they were
&ldquo;patterns of heavenly things.&rdquo; But why the
astonishing fact, that when sinful creatures
created a tent in the wilderness, and a temple
subsequently at Jerusalem, the visible glory
of God descended, taking possession of the
place? God thus came down from heaven to
earth, with all these impressive circumstances
of visible majesty, to teach His creatures
that He was awfully glorious, and fearful
even in His praises; that even in His acts of
grace His holiness is solemnly declared; and
thus to show with what reverence and purity
man ought to approach to Him. So when
Isaiah was to be appointed to an office in which
he was to fear God, and not the face of man,
and which, to give it weight and authority,
required an entire sanctity, a scene similar to
that which had been displayed in the temple
at its consecration, but greatly heightened and
magnified, was disclosed to him in vision. The
space of this visionary temple appears to have
been far more ample than that of the one at
Jerusalem; the throne was greatly elevated,
it was &ldquo;high, and lifted up;&rdquo; the &ldquo;train,&rdquo;
the &ldquo;skirts&rdquo; (as in the margin) of the cloud
of the Divine presence filled the whole place;
instead of the carved representations of the
cherubim of glory fixed on the mercy-seat,
the prophet beholds the cherubim themselves,
living, and all ardour, activity, and adoration;
they are not represented in the vision as the
cherubim in the holiest of all, silently gazing
on the glory of God and the mysteries of His
covenant, but as hymning His praises, proclaiming
His spotless purity, and declaring
&ldquo;the whole earth to be full of His glory.&rdquo;
The prophet, beholding the wondrous scene,
sinks oppressed and self-abhorred, until a coal
from the altar touches his lips, and he is thus
sanctified to the service of God, and put among
His ministers.&mdash;<i>Watson.</i></p></div>

<div class="footnote" id="o109_fn2"><p><a href="#o109_fna2"><span class="label">[2]</span></a>
No rebellions shake the throne of God;
though &ldquo;the heathen rage and the people imagine
a vain thing,&rdquo; yet &ldquo;he that sitteth in
the heavens shall laugh; the Lord shall have
them in derision.&rdquo; The throne of God is a
rock in the midst of the ever-rolling ocean of
created existence, that heaves and swells with
ceaseless change; but, in comparison of Him,
its mightiest billows have but their moment
of existence, and sink into the mass at the base
of the immovable throne of the Everlasting
One.&mdash;<i>Watson.</i></p></div>

As those that are nearest of a king&rsquo;s
attendants stand behind his throne or chair of
state, at his elbow.&mdash;<i>Day.</i></p>

<p>This is the only passage of Scripture in
which the seraphim are mentioned. According
to the orthodox view, which originated with
Dionysius the Areopagite, they stand at the
head of the nine choirs of angels, the first rank
consisting of <i>seraphim, cherubim,</i> and <i>throni.</i>
And this is not without support, if we compare
the cherubim mentioned in Ezekiel, which carried
the chariot of the divine throne; whereas
here the seraphim are said to surround the seat
on which the Lord worshipped. In any case,
the seraphim and cherubim were heavenly
beings of different kinds; and there is no
weight in the attempts of Hendewerk and
Stickel to prove that they are one and the
same. And certainly the name <i>seraphim</i> does
not signify merely spirits as such, but even, if
not the highest of all, yet a distinct order from
the rest; for the Scriptures really teach that
there are gradations in rank in the hierarchy
of heaven. Nor were they mere symbols or
fanciful images, as H&auml;vernick imagines, but
real spiritual beings who visibly appeared to
the prophet, and that in a form corresponding
to their own supersensuous being, and to the
design of the whole transaction. Whilst the
<span class="pagenum" id="p139">[p.&nbsp;139]</span>
seraphim hovered on both sides of Him that
sat upon the throne, and therefore formed two
opposite choirs, each ranged in a semicircle,
they presented antiphonal worship to Him that
sat upon the throne.&mdash;<i>Delitzsch.</i></p>

<p>The cherubim in the temple represented no
doubt spiritual powers and presence in the most
general sense, those who look upon God and
reflect His light. If we distinguish between
them and the cherubim, as we do in our &ldquo;Te
Deum,&rdquo; these last would seem more especially to
represent those divine energies and affections of
which the zeal, devotion, and sympathy of man
are counterparts.&mdash;<i>F.&nbsp;D. Maurice.</i></p>

<p>The name cannot possibly be connected with
<i>s&acirc;r&acirc;ph,</i> a snake (Sanscrit, <span lang="sa-Latn">sarpa,</span> Latin, <span lang="la">Serpens</span>);
and to trace the word to a verb <i>s&acirc;raph</i> in the
sense of the Arabic <span lang="ar-Latn">&lsquo;sarafa (&lsquo;sarufa),</span> to tower
high, to be exalted, or highly honoured (as
Gesenius, Hengetenberg, and others have
done), yields a sense that does not very
strongly commend itself. On the other hand,
to follow Knobel, who reads <span lang="hbo-Latn">sh&acirc;r&acirc;thim,</span> worshippers
of God), and thus presents the Lexicon
with a new word, and to pronounce the word
<span lang="hbo-Latn">seraphim</span> a copyist&rsquo;s error, would be a rash concession
to the heaven-storming omnipotence
which is supposed to reside in the ink of a
German scholar. It is hardly admissible, however,
to interpret the name as signifying directly
spirits of light or fire, since the true meaning
of <i>s&acirc;raph</i> is not <span lang="la">urere</span> (to burn), but <span lang="la">comburere</span>
(to set on fire or burn up). Umbreig endeavours
to do justice to this transitive meaning by adopting
the explanation &ldquo;fiery beings,&rdquo; by which
all earthly corruption is opposed and destroyed.
The vision itself, however, appears to point to
a much more distinctive and special meaning
in the name, which only occurs in this passage
of Isaiah.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. If the fact that a seraph absolved
the seer by means of this fire of love
(vers. 6, 7) is to be taken as an illustrative
example of the historical calling of the seraphim,
they were the vehicles and media of the
fire of divine love, just as the cherubim in
Ezekiel were the vehicles and media of the fire of
divine wrath. For just as in the case before
us, a seraph takes the fire of love from the
altar; so there, in Ezek. x.&nbsp;6, 7, a cherub takes
the fire of wrath from the throne-chariot.
Consequently the cherubim appear as the
vehicles and media of the wrath which destroys
sinners, or rather the divine <span lang="la">doxa,</span>
with its fiery side turned towards the world;
and the seraphim as the vehicles and media
of the love which destroys sin, or of the same
divine <span lang="la">doxa</span> with its light side towards the
world.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. &ldquo;Seraphic love&rdquo; is the expression
used in the language of the Church to denote
the <span lang="la">ne plus ultra</span> of holy love in the creature.&mdash;<i>Delitzsch.</i></p></div>

Thus expressing his profound reverence
and becoming modesty in the Divine presence.
We can hardly approach those who are greatly
our superiors but with downcast eyes, intimating
the consciousness we feel of their pre-eminence,
and our profound respect for the
excellency and dignity. We cannot look at the
sun shining with meridian splendour, but we
are obliged to cover our eyes with our hands.
Such is the infinite glory of the eternal Jehovah,
that celestial spirits around His throne
appeared to our prophet covering their faces
with their wings. Light inaccessible and full
of glory, in which God resides, was too strong
for them directly to contemplate.&mdash;<i>Macculloch.</i></p></div>

<div class="footnote" id="o110_fn3"><p><a href="#o110_fna3"><span class="label">[3]</span></a>
In Scripture language the <i>feet</i> sometimes
denote all the lower parts of the body which
decency requires to be concealed. In eastern
countries these were generally covered by the
long garments which they were accustomed to
wear: hence it may have been thought want
of respect to appear in public, on solemn occasions,
with the feet uncovered.&mdash;<i>Macculloch.</i></p>

<p>In a similar description of the cherubim in
Ezek. i.&nbsp;11, it is said that they covered <i>their
bodies.</i> In Isaiah the expression clearly denotes,
not the feet only, but the lower extremities.&mdash;<i>Barnes.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">I. The Seraphim.</span>&mdash;The Scriptures
disclose to us the fact that there is
a spiritual world, vast and variously
populated, superior to this world,
yet connected with it and exerting
upon it powerful influences. Little
beyond the <i>fact</i> is made known to
us; few details are granted us; yet
glimpses into it have been vouchsafed,
and among the most interesting and
instructive of them is our text.</p>

<p>Only here do we read of <i>seraphim:</i>
elsewhere we read of <i>cherubim</i> (Gen.
iii.&nbsp;24; Ezek. x.&nbsp;1&ndash;22, &amp;c.); and of
<i>living ones</i> (Rev. iv.&nbsp;6&ndash;8). From the
fact that these &ldquo;living ones&rdquo; in some
respects resemble both the &ldquo;seraphim&rdquo;
of Isaiah and the &ldquo;cherubim&rdquo; of
Ezekiel, some eminent scholars believe
these are three names for one order
of beings. Others, with whom we
are disposed to sympathise, believe
that the two names &ldquo;cherubim&rdquo; and
&ldquo;seraphim&rdquo; really indicate two orders
of spiritual intelligences, resembling
each other, yet distinct. Whether
the &ldquo;living ones&rdquo; of the Apocalypse
are cherubim, or seraphim, or a third
order of exalted ministers of the Most
High, is a question concerning which
we cannot speak confidently.</p>

<p>Scholars are divided as to the
significance of the name &ldquo;seraphim:&rdquo;
some derive the word from a root
signifying <i>to burn,</i> others from a root
signifying <i>to be exalted.</i></p>

<p>But there can be no question that
the descriptions of the &ldquo;seraphim,&rdquo;
the &ldquo;cherubim,&rdquo; and the &ldquo;living ones&rdquo;
are symbolical; the terms employed
are figures adapted to convey to our
minds true descriptions of beings of
whom a literal description would now
be unintelligible by <span class="wsnw">us.<a id="o112_fna1" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#o112_fn1">[1]</a></span>
<i>&ldquo;Wings&rdquo;</i>
are symbols of <span class="wnsw">swiftness:<a id="o112_fna2" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#o112_fn2">[2]</a></span>
here the symbol is triplicated to indicate the
exceeded swiftness&mdash;the immense
energy&mdash;of these messengers of God
(Ps. civ.&nbsp;4). <i>&ldquo;With twain he covered
his face,&rdquo;</i> in token of humility. <i>&ldquo;With
twain he covered his feet,&rdquo;</i> in token of
reverence. <i>&ldquo;With twain he did fly,&rdquo;</i> in
token of readiness to do God&rsquo;s will&mdash;three
points in which we should strive
evermore to resemble these exalted
intelligences.</p>

<p>To them is granted an immediate
vision of God, and the effect upon
them is expressed by their song:
<i>&ldquo;Holy,&rdquo;</i> &amp;c.</p>

<p>II. Consider next <span class="smcap">this Song of
the Seraphim.</span> <b>1.&nbsp;They acknowledge
God as &ldquo;the Lord of</b>
<span class="wsnw"><b>hosts.&rdquo;</b><a id="o112_fna3" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#o112_fn3">[3]</a></span>
This term in its first use in human language
referred to the sun, moon, and stars
(Gen. ii.&nbsp;1; Neh. ix.&nbsp;6, &amp;c.). Thus
considered, how wonderful are the
conceptions which are opened out to
us of the Divine power and glory!
(Isa. xi.&nbsp;2&ndash;6). But it includes also
those thousands of thousands of exalted
intelligences who hearken to His word
and do His pleasure. &ldquo;A great King&rdquo;
is the Lord our God! <b>2.&nbsp;They teach
us that the glory of God is co-extensive
with His works.</b> All that Isaiah
saw was that God&rsquo;s glory filled the
temple: what they saw was that His
glory filled the earth. <i>&ldquo;The whole
earth,&rdquo; &amp;c.</i> 1.&nbsp;This declaration is
true, if we think of Him <i>as the God of
nature.</i> Everything that He has made
is &ldquo;good.&rdquo; Even a snowflake shows
forth His glory. Science is a servant
of God, and is teaching us to understand
somewhat of the wondrousness
and beneficence of His works. 2.&nbsp;It
is true if we think of Him <i>as the God of
providence.</i> Human history, comprehensively
and thoughtfully considered,
shows that, while men are free, they
are yet under the control of One who
rules over all in the interests of righteousness
and truth (Ps. lxxvi.&nbsp;10;
Isa. x.&nbsp;5&ndash;7, &amp;c.). To angelic intelligences
how profoundly interesting
must be the problems which God is
working out in the government of this
world! (Rev. xv.&nbsp;3). 3.&nbsp;It is true
even if we think of Him <i>as the God of</i>
<span class="pagenum" id="p141">[p.&nbsp;141]</span>
<i>redemption.</i> Possibly (though perhaps
not probably) this earth is the only
sphere in which His glory in this
respect is manifested. But here it is
manifested in the mission and work of
His Son (Eph. iii.&nbsp;10). Even where
the Gospel has not yet been proclaimed
there are senses in which His glory as
the God of redemption is manifested:
even there, for Christ&rsquo;s sake, He is
patient with sinners, He strives with
them by His Spirit, He is preparing
them for the future triumphs of the
Cross. The history of our race, when
it shall be seen as a whole, will all
redound to His glory as the God of
<span class="wsnw">redemption.<a id="o112_fna4" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#o112_fn4">[4]</a></span>
<b>3.&nbsp;In the holiness
of God the seraphim find the supreme
subject for adoration and song:</b> <i>Holy,</i>
&amp;c. Other attributes of the Most High
are the themes of their thought and
worship, but it is His holiness that
excites their most rapturous praise.
Why? 1.&nbsp;<i>They have never needed His
mercy;</i> it is reserved for <i>us</i> to sing the
sweet song of redeeming grace. On
account of our redemption they rejoice
(Luke xv.&nbsp;10), but doubtless they
rejoice in it most because the mercy
shown us is a holy mercy; it was so
shown as to solve some of the profoundest
moral problems, and so as to
leave untouched the principle of righteousness
on which God&rsquo;s throne eternally
abides (Rom. iii.&nbsp;26). Not having
needed that mercy themselves, it is
natural that they should rather magnify
the holiness which had been shown
in it and which is the need of all. 2.&nbsp;<i>It
is the holiness of God that gives value
to all His other attributes.</i> They are
valuable only because they are directed
by unswerving holiness. The holiness
of God is the foundation of the peace,
and joy, and the love of the moral
universe. Were God not holy, even
hell itself would be a more awful abode;
for then to all its other woes would be
added the possibility of suffering inflicted
in mere vindictiveness. We
also are called to join in the song of
the seraphim (Ps. xxx.&nbsp;4, xcvii.&nbsp;12):
let us beseech Him so to sanctify us by
His Spirit, that in our lips the song
may not be a sacrilege!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">III. The Effects of the Song.</span> 1.&nbsp;<i>&ldquo;The
posts of the door moved at the voice
of him that</i>
<span class="wsnw"><i>cried.&rdquo;</i><a id="o112_fna5" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#o112_fn5">[5]</a></span>
A symbol this
of the constant effects of the proclamation
of truth. At every new
announcement of it earthly things
that seem most solid shake, and many
of them totter and fall and disappear
(2&nbsp;Cor. x.&nbsp;4; Heb. xii.&nbsp;26&ndash;28). 2.&nbsp;<i>And
the house was filled with smoke.</i> In
response to the worship of the seraphim
the temple became so completely filled
with the Divine glory that the radiance
overpowered the prophet&rsquo;s vision.
What he calls &ldquo;smoke&rdquo; was excess of
light (1&nbsp;Kings viii.&nbsp;10&ndash;12;
Rev. <span class="wsnw">xv. 8).<a id="o112_fna6" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#o112_fn6">[6]</a></span>
So would it be with us were
our craving for a fuller manifestation
of God in His works and word granted.
We have as much light now as we can
bear. A fuller revelation would only
dazzle, confuse, and blind us. The
time is to come when we shall see
God &ldquo;as He is,&rdquo; but this will then be
possible, because &ldquo;we shall be like
Him;&rdquo; and that time is not yet!</p>

<i>&ldquo;Above the throne stood the seraphim.
Each one had six wings. With twain he covered
his face, and with twain he covered his feet,
and with twain he did fly.&rdquo;</i> The sense of awe
increasing with the clearness and purity of a
spirit and with the nearness of its approach to
God; the face being veiled which receives the
light for Him, and most covets to behold
Him; the absence of all which to display their
own perfection in spirits who are perfect; the
freedom and willingness to go anywhere, to
do any errands of mercy; these are some of
the more obvious thoughts which the study of
this vision suggests. There are others which
lie hidden, which we may have a glimpse of
from time to time, and which words might
mar. For it is true of earthly symbols, still
more of heavenly visions, that they are meant
to carry us out of words and above words.&mdash;<i>F.&nbsp;D. Maurice.</i></p></div>

<div class="footnote" id="o112_fn3"><p><a href="#o112_fna3"><span class="label">[3]</span></a>
This title of Jehovah, with some variations,
is found upwards of 160 times in the
Old Testament. The meaning of the word
<i>hosts</i> is doubtless the same as that of <i>army</i> in
Dan. iv.&nbsp;35, and includes all the myriads of
holy angels who people the celestial spheres, as
in 1&nbsp;Kings xxii.&nbsp;19 the host of heaven were
seen by Micaiah standing round the throne of
God. So in Ps. ciii.&nbsp;21, cxlviii.&nbsp;2, the hosts of
God are His angels. (Comp. Deut. xxxiii.&nbsp;2.)
<span class="pagenum" id="p142">[p.&nbsp;142]</span>
By a light metonymy, or may be in a slightly
different sense, <i>the host of heaven</i> designates
the heavenly spheres themselves (Gen. ii.&nbsp;1;
Deut. iv.&nbsp;19, xvii.&nbsp;3; Isa. xxxiv.&nbsp;4, &amp;c.). It is
probably with reference to the idolatrous worship
of the host of heaven that the title of
<i>the Lord of hosts</i> was given to the true God,
as asserting His universal supremacy. (See
Neh. ix.&nbsp;6.) In the New Testament, the phrase
occurs only once, James v.&nbsp;4, <i>the Lord of Sabaoth.</i>
In Rom. ix.&nbsp;29, it is a quotation from
Isaiah.&mdash;<i>Professor Rawlinson.</i></p></div>

<div class="footnote" id="o112_fn4"><p><a href="#o112_fna4"><span class="label">[4]</span></a>
Sin has already served, as all things
must, to bring into view more clearly the glory
of God, for had there been no sin there could
have been no mercy; and in its punishment,
its overthrow, and its extirpation, His glory
will be yet more signally displayed. Hercules
could never have been deified, if there had
been no monsters to overcome. True is the
seraph&rsquo;s song even now, but it shall be more
manifestly and gloriously true in that day, so
surely and swiftly drawing nigh, when Christ
shall have subdued all enemies unto Him, and
God shall be All in all.&mdash;<i>R.&nbsp;A.&nbsp;B.</i></p>

<p>The vision reaches its highest point in the
cry, <i>Holy, holy, holy!</i> It is the holiness of
God which the seraphim proclaim, that which
cannot be represented to the eye, that of which
descriptions and symbols furnish no image.
It is that holiness which fills not the heaven
of heavens only but the whole earth, <i>seeing that
was made very good, seeing that in its order and
constitution it was still perfectly good,</i> though
man defiled it by their deeds, though the habitations
of cruelty were set upon the midst of
it.&mdash;<i>F.&nbsp;D. Maurice.</i></p></div>

<div class="footnote" id="o112_fn5"><p><a href="#o112_fna5"><span class="label">[5]</span></a>
The voice of the seraphim at this time
was so loud and melodious, and the power of
their heavenly music was so great, when extolling
the holiness and glory of Jehovah that
the posts, with the lintel of the door of the
temple, seemed to tremble, to be shaken in
the place where they stood, or loosed from their
place. This was a very surprising effect
(though seen only in vision); for these posts
were so large and strong, that they supported
gates of brass which are said to have required
twenty men to shut them, on account of their
ponderous weight.&mdash;<i>Macculloch.</i></p></div>

<div class="footnote" id="o112_fn6"><p><a href="#o112_fna6"><span class="label">[6]</span></a>
<i>Delitzsch</i> thus gives the usual interpretation
of this clause: <i>The house was filled
with smoke.</i> Many compare this with the
similar occurrence in connection with the dedication
of Solomon&rsquo;s temple (1&nbsp;Kings viii.&nbsp;10);
but Drechsler is correct in stating that the two
cases are not parallel, for there God simply
attested His own presence by the cloud of
smoke behind which He concealed Himself,
whereas here there was no need of any such
self-attestation. Moreover, in this instance
God does not dwell in the cloud and thick
darkness, whilst the smoke is represented as
the effect of the songs of praise in which the
seraphim have joined, and not of the presence
of God. The smoke arose from the altar of
incense mentioned in verse 6. But when
Drechsler says that it was the prayers of <i>saints</i>
(as in Rev. v.&nbsp;8, viii.&nbsp;3, 4), which ascended
to the Lord, in the smoke, there is a thought
which is quite out of place here. The smoke
was the immediate consequence of the seraph&rsquo;s
song of praise.</p></div>

honour. A sight of God

We should naturally expect that a
vision vouchsafed to an Apostle of Christ, at
the end of the first century of the Christian era,
would be larger in scope, brighter in glory, less
enigmatical in structure, in significance, than
those which were attached to the ministrations of
prophets. This expectation is not disappointed.
We find the visions of the throne of God which
prophets saw revived and incorporated in the
Apostle&rsquo;s vision, and we find the Christian seer
enlightened with a more distinct understanding
of the heavenly symbols. <i>Isaiah</i> saw the
throne of God in the temple, surrounded by
seraphim, &ldquo;crying one to another, Holy, holy, holy,
is the Lord of hosts.&rdquo; <i>Ezekiel,</i> sitting by the
river of Chebar, saw the throne of God, as a
chariot of war coming out of a whirlwind and
going forth over the earth, attended by mighty
ministers of judgment, carrying the Son of
Man to victory. <i>Daniel</i> beheld the great session
of justice; the gathered myriads before the
awful purity of the Divine Judge; the consuming
laws executed by the faithful servants. But
the Christian <i>Apostle,</i> looking through the
door of heaven, beheld all these ancient visions,
which had come down through eight centuries
of time, blended into one. He saw Isaiah&rsquo;s
seraphim, but they had the appearance of
Ezekiel&rsquo;s living creatures, with fourfold countenances;
their wings were still visible, and
their voices still responded, &ldquo;Holy, holy, holy,
Lord God Almighty!&rdquo; He saw the thrones
round about <i>the Throne,</i> as Daniel saw them,
but he was able to count them; they were four
and twenty; and upon the seats he &ldquo;saw four
and twenty elders sitting, clothed in white
raiment, and they had on their heads crowns
of gold.&rdquo; The stream of fire, which the prophet
saw proceeding from under the throne
was now &ldquo;a sea of glass like unto crystal.&rdquo;
He that sat on the throne, who appeared to
Ezekiel as though He were clothed with fiery
amber, was &ldquo;to look upon like a jasper and
sardine stone;&rdquo; and the rainbow was still there,
&ldquo;round about the throne, in sight like unto
an emerald.&rdquo; &ldquo;Lightnings, thunderings, and
voices&rdquo; proceeded out of the throne, as before
fire flamed out and devoured. &ldquo;The seven
spirits of God,&rdquo; like &ldquo;burning lamps of fire,&rdquo;
stand in the presence of the Holy One. And
the Apostle witnesses the sublime service of
heaven, the living creatures &ldquo;giving glory and
honour and thanks to Him that sat on the
throne;&rdquo; and, in response to their worship,
&ldquo;the four and twenty elders falling down before
Him and worshipping Him,&rdquo; and singing
their united praises, &ldquo;Thou art worthy, O
Lord, to receive glory and honour and power;
for Thou hast created all things, and for Thy
pleasure they are and were created!&rdquo;&mdash;<i>R.&nbsp;A.

<h3 class="tdc" id="o114"><span class="smcap">Volunteer Service.</span></h3>

<p class="bq">vi.&nbsp;8. <i>Then said I, Here am I, send me.</i></p>

<p>This is a chapter of autobiography.
Here is disclosed the secret of the
wonderful energy with which for
more than half a century Isaiah prosecuted
his ministry. He is the Paul
of the Old Testament. Allowance
being made for difference of phraseology,
there is a striking resemblance
between the call of Isaiah and of Paul
(comp. chap. vi. with Acts ix.). Both
sought to serve the heavenly King;
and both received a commission to
work, spiritual and catholic beyond
all conceptions of their time,&mdash;the one
penning the Gospel of the suffering
Messiah, the other vindicating the
truth that the Gospel is God&rsquo;s message
to the <i>world.</i> The text reminds us&mdash;</p>

<p><b>I. Of the Christian&rsquo;s offer of service.</b>
The offer of service which the prophet
made was&mdash;1.&nbsp;<i>Free.</i> He spoke spontaneously,
and not as the result of pressure
from <span class="wsnw">without.<a id="o114_fna1" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#o114_fn1">[1]</a></span>
2.&nbsp;<i>Truthful.</i> Unlike
one of the sons in the parable
(Matt. xxi.&nbsp;30), he meant what he
said. 3.&nbsp;<i>Bold.</i> It was made concerning
an unknown mission. The justification
of the boldness of his offer is,
that it was made to God, who always
qualifies His servants for the tasks
to which He calls them. 4.&nbsp;<i>Personal.</i>
The prophet placed at God&rsquo;s disposal,
not some of his property merely, but
<i>himself.</i> 5.&nbsp;<i>It involved the most complete
self-surrender.</i> All thought of self
control the prophet resigned. He
placed himself as an instrument in
God&rsquo;s hands. He was ready go to
where, when, and on what errand God
might <span class="wsnw">determine.<a id="o114_fna2" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#o114_fn2">[2]</a></span>
Such are the
offers of service in which God delights.</p>

<p><b>II. Of the steps that lead up to
this offer.</b> The offer may take men
by surprise, but there has always been
preparation for it, as there has been
long preparation for the lightning that
<span class="pagenum" id="p144">[p.&nbsp;144]</span>
leaps suddenly from the sky. Such
offers as the prophet made are preceded&mdash;1.&nbsp;By
<i>a vision of God,</i> of the
thrice Holy One, filling the soul with
awe, and causing it to tremble (vers.
1&ndash;4). 2.&nbsp;By <i>self-prostration of spirit,</i>
a conviction of utter sinfulness (ver.
5). This is the invariable result of a
true vision of God (Exod. iii.&nbsp;2; Josh.
v.&nbsp;14; Judg. vi.&nbsp;22, xii.&nbsp;22; Luke
v.&nbsp;8; Rev. i.&nbsp;17). This is also a
prime condition of fitness for service.
3.&nbsp;By <i>the touch of a mediator</i> (vers. 6,
7). &ldquo;They that be struck down by
visions of God&rsquo;s glory shall soon be
raised up again by visits of His grace.&rdquo;
Blessed is the man who has <i>both</i>
visions. A sense of pardon is essential
to large usefulness. Imperfect
realisation of forgiveness is one of the
most frequent causes of weakness in
Christian service. 4.&nbsp;By <i>a moral
transformation.</i> The offerer has become
a new man from the centre outwards.
Now he can hear God&rsquo;s voice: &ldquo;I
heard,&rdquo; &amp;c. It is a voice to which now
he feels he <i>must</i> respond: &ldquo;Here am
I,&rdquo; &amp;c. In some degree every Christian
is thus prepared. These essentials
of service are also essentials of
Christian life. These experiences are at
once your credentials and your powers.</p>

<p><b>III.</b> That <b>God always accepts offers
of service for which there has been
this preparation, and that bear these
marks.</b> He never rejects true volunteers.
Offers hastily made and half-meant
He passes by (Josh. xxiv.&nbsp;18,
19; John ii.&nbsp;23&ndash;25); but genuine,
whole-hearted offers of service, He invariably
accepts.</p>

<p>In conclusion, let us lay up in our
memories three facts in connection
with service. 1.&nbsp;<i>True service is not
incompatible with failure.</i> We are too
apt to connect failure with incompetency
in the servant. Many do fail
through incompetency, but not all.
The prophet divinely called and most
royally endowed may fail, because of
the moral obduracy and perverseness
of those to whom he is sent (vers. 9,
10). 2.&nbsp;<i>True service is not incompatible
with sorrow</i> (vers. 11, 12). That man
is inhuman who without profound
grief can behold the perversity of
sinners, and the calamities with which
in consequence they are visited. 3.&nbsp;<i>True
service will never be left without reward.</i>
Multitudes may reject the prophet&rsquo;s
message, yet there will be &ldquo;a tenth&rdquo;
who will accept it and be saved.&mdash;<i>J.&nbsp;R. Wood.</i></p>

<p class="bq">vi.&nbsp;8. <i>Also, I heard the voice of the Lord, &amp;c.</i></p>

<p><b>I. God wants messengers unto sinful
men.</b> Tidings concerning sin and
salvation, mercy and deliverance, God&rsquo;s
grace and man&rsquo;s misery, must be published.
Might send seraphim and
the angel host. God elects to send
men to their fellow-men. &ldquo;Whom shall
I send?&rdquo; is not the inquiry of a
Divine perplexity, but the stimulative
question of one who calls for willing
workers. <b>II.&nbsp;God especially qualifies
His messengers.</b> How does He in an
especial manner fit men for His highest
service? 1.&nbsp;<i>By an awe-inspiring sight
of Himself.</i> 2.&nbsp;<i>By distressing convictions
of personal sin.</i> 3.&nbsp;<i>By sanctifying
all the faculties to His use.</i> <b>III.&nbsp;God&rsquo;s
call should meet with a ready response.</b>
He desires volunteers, &ldquo;Who will go
for us?&rdquo; The constraint of love is the
omnipotent motive force. 1.&nbsp;<i>The call
is heard individually.</i> &ldquo;I heard the
voice of the Lord.&rdquo; 2.&nbsp;<i>The call
provokes self-surrender.</i> &ldquo;Here am I.&rdquo;
3.&nbsp;<i>The call demands entire self-abandonment.</i>
&ldquo;Send me&rdquo;&mdash;anywhere, on any
errands, at any time, in any capacity.
<b>IV.&nbsp;How may we ascertain that we are
required to become messengers of the
living God?</b> 1.&nbsp;By the separating
voice of God. 2.&nbsp;By the discipline of
preparation. 3.&nbsp;By the openings of
beckoning opportunities. The &ldquo;joy of
the Lord&rdquo; will be our strength when
most we feel the pressure of &ldquo;the burden
of the Lord.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Matthew Braithwaithe.</i></p>

<h3 class="tdc" id="o116"><span class="smcap">A Strange and Sad Errand.</span></h3>

<p class="bq">vi.&nbsp;9, 10. <i>And He said, Go, and tell this people, &amp;c.</i></p>

<p>A sad and mysterious errand, the
statement of which might well have
quenched the enthusiasm inspired by
his vision of the Divine glory. When
he exclaimed, &ldquo;Here am I, send me!&rdquo;
how little did he anticipate for what
purpose he would be sent! It must
have astounded and saddened him,
and it is full of astonishment and
mystery for us. How could God have
sent His servant on an errand such
as this?</p>

<p>Much of the mystery will be relieved,
though not altogether removed, if we
recognise&mdash;what I believe to be the
fact&mdash;that here we have a statement,
not of the messages Isaiah was to
deliver (for they were many, and were
revealed to him at various times), but
of what would be the result of them
all. Those to whom he was sent,
and whom he desired to bless, would
not be made better, but worse, by his
ministry.</p>

<p>This is in accordance with a well-known
and terrible fact, viz., that the
proclamation of truth often leads men
to cleave more desperately to
<span class="wsnw">error.<a id="o116_fna1" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#o116_fn1">[1]</a></span>
Why, then, does God send His
servants to proclaim it?</p>

<p><i>Not because He desires the depravity
and destruction of men.</i> Such a desire
would be utterly inconsistent with His
<i>character</i> and with His express <i>declarations</i>
(Ezek. xviii.&nbsp;23, 32, &amp;c.). We
need not imagine, then, that we have
here a confirmation of those schemes
of arbitrary election and reprobation
which some theologians have attributed
to Him.</p>

<p>But 1. <i>Because it is necessary for the
preservation of His character as a God
of righteousness and mercy that He should
do what</i> <span class="smcap">ought</span> <i>to result in the salvation of
men.</i> Had He not sent His prophets
forth on their sad mission, we should
have been confronted by a greater
difficulty: God permitting His chosen
people to go on to ruin without one
word of warning spoken, without one
effort put forth to arrest them. But
one of the supreme moral necessities of
the universe is this, that His character
as a God desiring the redemption of
sinners should be maintained unimpaired;
and therefore He sends forth
His messengers to proclaim the truth,
although He foresees that to many
they will be the &ldquo;savour of death
unto death,&rdquo;&mdash;and not &ldquo;the savour of life
unto life,&rdquo;&mdash;not as that same frosty
air which &ldquo;braces&rdquo; and invigorates
those who are already vigorous. As
this quotation reminds you, this is
the effect of the Gospel itself. Ought
God, therefore, never to have sent
its preachers forth? 2.&nbsp;<i>That stubborn
sinners may be left without excuse in
the day of their doom.</i> God will not
merely take vengeance on the violators
of His laws of righteousness; He will
make it manifest that while in Him
there is an awful severity, there is no
vindictiveness; and He will so act that,
even when that severity is most manifested,
not only the onlookers, but even
those who experience it shall be constrained
to confess, &ldquo;Just and true are
Thy ways, Thou King of saints!&rdquo; He
will not leave it possible for them to
say, &ldquo;Hadst Thou warned us, we should
not have sinned.&rdquo; They shall be speechless
(Matt. xxii.&nbsp;12; Jer. xliv.&nbsp;2&ndash;5).
3.&nbsp;<i>That the righteous may be saved.</i> Did
He not send His prophets forth to
instruct and warn, even the men in
whose hearts are the germs of righteousness
and holiness of life would follow
the multitude to do evil: <i>they</i> hear, and
turn, and live: and this is ample justification
of the prophet&rsquo;s mission. Those
who perish would have perished without
it; but without it those who are
saved would have perished also. And
in this respect Isaiah&rsquo;s ministry was not
in vain: while to the vast majority of
the nation it was &ldquo;the savour of death
unto death,&rdquo; it was to a few&mdash;&ldquo;the holy
<span class="pagenum" id="p146">[p.&nbsp;146]</span>
seed&rdquo; of whom also this chapter speaks
to us&mdash;&ldquo;the savour of live unto life.&rdquo;
They learned to trust, not in Assyria
nor in Egypt, but in the Holy One of
Israel, and therefore were &ldquo;kept in perfect
peace&rdquo; amid all the convulsions
and catastrophes of their time.</p>

<p>The passage seemed at the outset
full of mystery; our tendency was to
shun it as one that would not bear
investigation, as one about which the
least that could be said the better, as
one which we could have wished had
never been written. What do we see
now? That here we have an illustration
of the Psalmist&rsquo;s saying, &ldquo;Clouds
and darkness are round about Him&rdquo;&mdash;so
to our purblind vision it seems, the
brightness being <i>so</i> bright that it dazzles
and blinds us; &ldquo;but righteousness and
judgment are the habitation of His
throne.&rdquo; What should we learn from
this? 1.&nbsp;<i>Never to fear to investigate anything
in God&rsquo;s Word.</i> There is nothing
here which its friends need wish to hide
out of sight; it is all worthy of Him
from whom it came (Ps. xix.&nbsp;9). 2.&nbsp;<i>Never
to distrust God because of anything in either
His Word or His Providence.</i> Things
that might cause distrust we shall meet
with; some of them we shall never
explain here, when we can know only
&ldquo;in part;&rdquo; yet let us keep fast hold of
the glorious and gladdening truth, that
&ldquo;in Him is no darkness at all.&rdquo; God
is light; God is love.</p>

To a man living in the belief of what is
erroneous or the practice of what is wrong
you proclaim the truth, and what happens?
(1)&nbsp;Either he amends his creed or his conduct;
or (2)&nbsp;he <i>disregards</i> what you say, and goes on
as before; or (3)&nbsp;he <i>rejects</i> what you say, and
cleaves to his error more passionately than he
would have done otherwise. The latter is a
very frequent result. For example, slavery
once prevailed throughout our colonies and
the United States of America. Holy men held
slaves; they had no suspicion of the wrongfulness
of slavery. When its wrongfulness
was proclaimed, many abandoned it; but
others held to it,&mdash;some not caring whether
it was wrong or right, looking only to the fact
that it was profitable; but others reasoned themselves
into a persuasion that it was right, that
it is Scriptural, and maintained the system
with a tenacity and passion they never felt
before its wickedness was declared. In thousands
of cases that was the result of the anti-slavery
movement. God foresaw it, yet He
raised up faithful men to proclaim the doctrines
of human brotherhood and freedom, and sent
them forth on their perilous errand, saying
to them in effect, <i>&ldquo;Go, and tell this people,
Hear ye indeed, but understand not; and see ye
indeed, but perceive not. Make the heart of
this people fat, and make their ears heavy,
and shut their eyes, lest they see with their eyes,
and hear with their ears, and understand with
their heart, and convert, and be healed.&rdquo;</i> He
sent them forth, notwithstanding that He foresaw
that one inevitable effect of their mission
would be the confirmation of thousands in
error, the hardening of thousands in iniquity.
In like manner He raised up Isaiah and other
prophets to denounce their political schemes&mdash;their
alliances now with Egypt and now with
Assyria&mdash;to be huge mistakes, and to exhort
them to a life of holiness and of simple trust
in God; He foresaw that the result of their
efforts would <i>not</i> be the reformation of the
nation, and yet He sent them forth!</p></div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 class="tdc" id="o117"><span class="smcap">The Rejection of Divine Truth.</span></h3>

<p class="bq">vi.&nbsp;9, 10. <i>And He said, Go, and tell this people, &amp;c.</i></p>

<p>The Divine message&mdash;a message of
melting pathos and of startling warning,
of beseeching entreaty and of terrible
threatening&mdash;must be delivered
to men. &ldquo;Go and tell this people&rdquo;
is a command that shatters excuses
and imposes an imperative obligation.
God&rsquo;s speakers have no option&mdash;speak
they must (Jonah iii.&nbsp;2). The effects
of God&rsquo;s communications correspond
to the willingness or the wilfulness of
men.</p>

<p><b>I. Divine truth elicits human disposition.</b>
In the spring season, the sun
sits in judgment upon the trees of
gardens and forests. Then the trees
that have life have it more abundantly.
Their latent powers and possibilities
are developed and exhibited. The same
sun-force smites the decaying trees and
shrivels those having only goodliness
without life. Is not the Sun of Righteousness
&ldquo;a discerner of the thoughts
and intents of the heart&rdquo;? When on
earth, He who is &ldquo;the Truth&rdquo; evoked
the hidden feelings, purposes, and qualities
<span class="pagenum" id="p147">[p.&nbsp;147]</span>
of men; and His manifold message
repeats the process to the end of
time (John ix.&nbsp;39). The ministry of
Isaiah was a revealing ministry: the
character of men and the character
of the nation by it were made manifest.
<b>II.&nbsp;Divine truth repelled because
of dislike.</b> &ldquo;Lest they see,
hear, understand, be converted and
healed.&rdquo; A diseased eye winces under
the scorching sunlight, as a disordered
soul will flinch under the fierce light
that streams upon it from above. The
disquieted conscience repels the entrance
of the truth, because of the
revolutions in thought, disposition,
purpose, character, and activity which
its admission would necessitate. None
are so blind, deaf, insensible as those
who do not want to see, hear, or feel
(John iii.&nbsp;19, 20). Men dislike the
purpose of God&rsquo;s good but severe discipline:
they want not to &ldquo;be converted
and healed,&rdquo; and they recoil
from the painful <span class="wsnw">process.<a id="o117_fna1" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#o117_fn1">[1]</a></span>
<b>III.&nbsp;Divine truth cannot be rejected without
injury.</b> Divine truth and grace
will not be void of result, though the
result may be most injurious (Rom
ii.&nbsp;4, 5). Consequences of lasting duration
are involved in our action of
opening or shutting the doors of the
<span class="wsnw">soul.<a id="o117_fna2" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#o117_fn2">[2]</a></span>
Not to receive the &ldquo;grace
upon grace&rdquo; of God is to put the spirit
into an attitude of opposition: this
attitude can easily become a confirmed
habit; and the habit, in righteous
retribution, may be ratified (Rev.
xxii.&nbsp;11). Antagonism to God&rsquo;s revelation
injures the soul&rsquo;s highest life;
its power of vision is dimmed or veiled;
the understanding loses its alertness
and fails to comprehend; the affections
become gross and carnal. Inexorable
is the spiritual law and appalling
the spiritual doom (Eph. iv.&nbsp;18).
Isaiah unfolded God&rsquo;s design of salvation;
but the design was intercepted
and frustrated by human perversity.
Men &ldquo;rejected the counsel of God
against themselves,&rdquo; and persistent resistance
rendered them &ldquo;past feeling.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Take heed how ye hear.&rdquo; &ldquo;Hear,
and your soul shall
<span class="wsnw">live.&rdquo;<a id="o117_fna3" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#o117_fn3">[3]</a></span>&mdash;<i>Matthew

&ldquo;There is light enough for those whose
sincere desire is to see; and darkness enough
for those of a contrary disposition. There is
brightness enough to illuminate the elect;
and enough of obscurity to humble them.
There is obscurity enough to blind the reprobate;
and brightness enough to condemn them
and to leave them without excuse.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Blaise
Pascal.</i></p></div>

&ldquo;The smallest particle of light falling
on the sensitive plate produces a chemical
change that can never be undone again; and
the light of Christ&rsquo;s love, once brought to the
knowledge and presented for the acceptance of
a soul, stamps on it an ineffaceable sign of its
having been there. Once heard, it is henceforward
a perpetual element in the whole condition,
character, and destiny of the hearer.
Every man that ever rejects Christ, does these
things thereby&mdash;wounds his own conscience,
hardens his own heart, and makes himself
a worse man, just because he has had a glimpse
of holiness, and has willingly, and almost consciously,
&ldquo;loved darkness rather than light.&rdquo;
Unbelief is its own judgment, its own condemnation:
unbelief, as sin, is punished like
other sins, by the perpetuation of deeper and
darker forms of itself. Every time that you
stifle a conviction, fight down a conviction, or
din away a conviction, you have harmed your
soul, made yourself a worse man, lowered the
tone of your conscience, enfeebled your will,
made your heart harder against love; you
have drawn another horny scale over the eye
that will prevent you from seeing the light that is
yonder. You have, as much as in you is,
approximated to the other pole of the universe
(if I may say that), to the dark and deadly
antagonist of mercy, and goodness, and truth,
and grace.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Alexander Maclaren.</i></p></div>

<div class="footnote" id="o117_fn3"><p><a href="#o117_fna3"><span class="label">[3]</span></a>
&ldquo;The great iniquity is, or then is the
Gospel hid in a sinful sense, when men have
it among them, or may have it, and will not
hear it; or do hear it, and never understand
it,&mdash;that is, never apply or set themselves to
understand it; or receive no conviction from
it; or receive no suitable impression on their
hearts from it. Thus, all the while, is the
Gospel hid to them by their own iniquity,
that they do voluntarily make resisting efforts
against it, as everything of sin must have
somewhat of <span lang="la">voluntarium</span> in it. It supposeth
that otherwise a brute agent might be as
capable of sin as a rational one, and that
cannot be. But here lies the iniquity, that
men might understand and they will not; and
there is a natural faculty that should turn
them, even in their very hearts; but there is
a sinful disinclination, and they will not turn.
For it is the will that is not turned: &ldquo;Ye will
not come unto me that ye might have life.&rdquo;
And so, when the Gospel is hid, it is hid, not
because men cannot see, but because they will
not. They do (as it were) pretend the veil;
stretch forth the veil before their eyes or bind
it close over their own eyes, hoodwink themselves
that they will not see. Being thus sinfully
<span class="pagenum" id="p148">[p.&nbsp;148]</span>
hidden, it comes also to be penally hidden
by a <i>nemesis,</i> hidden by a just <span lang="la">vindicta.</span> Ye
will not understand, then ye shall not understand;
ye will harden your hearts against light,
against grace, against the design of the Gospel,
and they shall be hardened. Since ye will
have it so, so let it be.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>John Howe.</i></p>

<p>For an exposition of this passage
see <span class="wsnw">note.<a id="o118_fna1" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#o118_fn1">[1]</a></span></p>

<p>Let us look steadily at the <i>facts</i>
before us, and then, perchance, we
may discern the <i>lessons</i> associated with
them. Isaiah desires to know how
long his strange and sad mission is to
continue; and the answer is, until its
utter failure to save his fellow-countrymen
from their sins and their impending
doom has been demonstrated, until
nothing but the mere life-germ of the
nation is left. Here really are three
facts, full of instruction for us to-day.
I.&nbsp;<i>Isaiah&rsquo;s mission and the calamities he
desired to avert by it were to work together.</i>
There was thus a twofold
appeal to the men of that generation;
and at its close God might have
repeated the challenge, &ldquo;What could
I have done more?&rdquo; (chap. v.&nbsp;4).
Both by offers of mercy and manifestations
of righteous anger He sought
to deliver them from the doom towards
which they madly hastened.
Thus God deals with the world to-day:
His preachers of righteousness and
His judgments because of unrighteousness
work side by side; this fact is a
conclusive proof that God is not willing
that the sinner should die. This
is true of nations, and it is true of
individuals. II.&nbsp;<i>Isaiah was to prosecute
his mission to the end, notwithstanding
the proofs that his efforts to deliver his
fellow-countrymen were vain.</i> This is
always the duty of God&rsquo;s messengers:
they are to deliver their message, and
reiterate it. Whether it is popular or
unpopular is a thing of which they are
not even to think! the one thing they
have to consider and remember is,
that it is true. III.&nbsp;<i>In the midst of
all the calamities of his time, Isaiah
was sustained by the assurance that the
nation he loves should not utterly perish.</i>
Nothing could hurt &ldquo;the holy seed&rdquo;
that constituted its true life. The
Church of to-day is full of imperfections;
the forces of unbelief are marshalling
themselves against her; it
may be that she will again be tried
by fierce persecutions: but the Lord&rsquo;s
true prophet can survey all these
possible calamities with calmness;
he knows that &ldquo;the holy seed&rdquo; which
constitutes her true life cannot be
injured by them.</p>

<p>Here, then, is instruction and encouragement
for the Lord&rsquo;s prophet to-day.
He is to preach the preaching which
God has bidden him, regardless of
everything but the fact that God had
sent it forth. He is not to modify his
message, to make it more palatable
to his hearers. He must not cease
to deliver it, although he sees that
his hearers are hardening themselves
against it, and so are bringing upon
themselves a heavier doom. Comfort
he will need, but he must find it in the
fact that there is a &ldquo;holy seed&rdquo; to
whom his ministry will be a blessing,
and in whose salvation, if he be faithful
to the end, he shall share.</p>

<p>In this passage there are also some
supplementary lessons of general
interest. 1.&nbsp;We have here an illustration
of <i>the persistence and success of
the Divine purposes.</i> God selected the
descendants of Abraham as the instruments
through whom He would
bless the world (Exod. xix.&nbsp;5, 6). Their
history has been one long struggle
against this purpose; but it has not
been a frustration of it: their very
waywardness and wickedness have
afforded occasions for the manifestation
of His character, and the consequent
revelations both of His goodness
and of His severity have been
<span class="pagenum" id="p149">[p.&nbsp;149]</span>
blessings in the world. In spite even
of their rejection of His Son they are
still His people, and He will at length
make them a holy people (Rom. xi.&nbsp;28&ndash;29).
2.&nbsp;<i>God does not hesitate to use
any means that will help to conform His
chosen ones to His own ideal.</i> It is a
solemn thing to be chosen of God:
that choice may involve possibilities
from which flesh and blood
<span class="wsnw">shrinks.<a id="o118_fna2" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#o118_fn2">[2]</a></span>
The way to avoid those possibilities
is to find out what God&rsquo;s
purpose concerning us is, and endeavour
to conform ourselves thereto:
then we shall find His choice of us a
well-spring of constant blessing.
3.&nbsp;<i>God does not despise the merest germs of
goodness.</i> Insignificant, comparatively,
as was &ldquo;the holy seed&rdquo; in Israel, He
watched over it with ceaseless care.
Comfort there is here for those who
lament that there is in them so little
of which God can approve. That
little He will not despise (1&nbsp;Kings xiv.&nbsp;13;
Isa. xlii.&nbsp;3); He sees what possibilities
of excellence there are in His
chosen <span class="wsnw">ones;<a id="o118_fna3" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#o118_fn3">[3]</a></span>
and those little germs
of excellence He will nourish until
they have developed into that which
will satisfy even Himself.</p>

<div class="footnote" id="o118_fn1"><p><a href="#o118_fna1"><span class="label">[1]</span></a>
He inquired how long this service of
hardening and this state of hardness were to
continue,&mdash;a question forced from him by his
sympathy with the nation to which he himself
belonged (cf. Exod. xxxii.&nbsp;9&ndash;14), and one
which was warranted by the certainty that God,
who is ever true to His promises, could not cast
off Israel as a people for ever. The answer
follows in ver. 11<i>b</i>&ndash;13: <i>&ldquo;Until towns are
wasted without inhabitant, and houses are without
man, and the ground shall be laid waste, a
wilderness, and Jehovah shall put men far away,
and there shall be many forsaken places within
the land. And is there still a tenth therein, this
also again is given up to destruction, like the
terebinth and the oak, of which, when they are
felled, only a root-stump remains: such a root-stump
is the holy seed.&rdquo;</i> The hardening judgment
would come to an end only when the land
of Israel had been made utterly desolate. Up
to the words &ldquo;given up to destruction,&rdquo; the
announcement is a threatening one; but from
this point to &ldquo;remains&rdquo; a consolatory prospect
begins to dawn; and in the last three words
this brighter prospect, like a distant streak of
light, bounds the horizon of the gloomy prophecy.
It shall happen as with the terebinth
and the oak. These trees were selected as
illustrations, not only because they are so
near akin to evergreens, and produced a similar
impression, or because there were so many
associations connected with them in the olden
times of Israel&rsquo;s history; but also because
they formed such fitting symbols of Israel, on
account of their peculiar facility for springing
up again from the root (like the beech and
nut, for example), even when they had been
completely felled.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The root-stump was the
remnant that had survived the judgment, and
the remnant would become a seed, out of
which a new Israel would spring up after the
old had been destroyed. Thus in a few words
is the way sketched out which God would
henceforth take with His people. The passage
contains an outline of the history of Israel to
the end of time. Israel as a nation was indestructible,
by virtue of the promise of God;
but the mass of the people were doomed to
destruction through the judicial sentence of
God, and only a remnant, which would be
converted, would perpetuate the nationality of
Israel, and inherit the glorious future. This
law of a blessing sunk in the depths of the
curse actually inflicted still prevails in the
history of the Jews. The way of salvation is
open to all. Individuals find it, and give us
a presentiment of what might be and is to be;
but the great mass are hopelessly lost, and
only when they have been swept away will a
holy seed, saved by a covenant-keeping God,
grow up into a new and holy Israel, which,
according to chap. xxvii.&nbsp;6, will fill the earth
with its fruits, or, as the Apostle expresses it
in Romans xi.&nbsp;12, become &ldquo;the riches of the
Gentiles.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Delitzsch.</i></p></div>

As the eye of the cunning lapidary
detects in the rugged pebble, just digged from
the mine, the polished diadem that shall
sparkle in the diadem of a king; or as the
sculptor in the rough block of marble, newly
hewn from the quarry, beholds the statue of
perfect grace and beauty which is latent there,
and waiting but the touch of his hand,&mdash;so
He who sees all, and the end from the beginning,
sees oftentimes greater wonders than
these. He sees the saint in the sinner, the
saint that shall be in the sinner that is; the
wheat in the tare; the shepherd feeding the
sheep in the wolf tearing the sheep; Paul in
the preacher of the faith in Saul the persecutor
of the faith; Israel a prince with God
in Jacob the trickster and the supplanter;
Matthew the Apostle in Levi the publican;
a woman that should love much in a woman
sinning much; and in some vine of the earth
bringing forth wild grapes and grapes of gall
a tree which shall yet bring forth good fruit,
and wine to make glad the heart; so that when
some, like those over-zealous servants in the
parable, would have Him pluck it up, and to
cast it without more ado into the wine-press
of the wrath of Almighty God, He exclaims
rather, &ldquo;Destroy it not, for a blessing is in it&rdquo; (Isa. lxv.&nbsp;8),
and is well content to await the end.&mdash;<i>Trench.</i></p>

<p>The historical <span class="wsnw">statements<a id="o119_fna1" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#o119_fn1">[1]</a></span>
in these verses afford illustrations of spiritual
truths. <b>I.&nbsp;The powers of evil are confederate
against the Lord&rsquo;s people</b> (vers.
1, 2, 6). By the combined forces of evil,
God&rsquo;s chosen ones have always been
assailed. The conflict began in Eden,
and has continued ever since. These
combined forces attacked our Lord,
and appeared for a time, outwardly at
least, to conquer. We must expect
similar assaults (John xvi.&nbsp;33). The
ultimate object of these foes is to
destroy our spiritual life. <b>II.&nbsp;The
Lord&rsquo;s people are often terrified by
the action of their foes.</b> Two things
may contribute to this. 1.&nbsp;<i>A sense
of personal guilt.</i> Conscience often
slumbers in prosperity, but awakens
and alarms us when danger threatens.
No doubt Ahaz remembered his sin,
when he saw his foes were coming.
2.&nbsp;<i>Distrust of the Lord.</i> It does not appear
that Ahaz told the Lord about his
trouble, or sought His help. His idolatry
had led him into unbelief&mdash;a
frequent cause of the Christian&rsquo;s terrors.
He looks at his troubles, and sinks,
because he does not lay hold on Christ
(Matt. xiv.&nbsp;30). <b>III.&nbsp;God seeks to allay
the fears of His people in the hour of
their trouble.</b> This is done in three
ways. 1.&nbsp;<i>By exhorting them to keep their
minds calm.</i> &ldquo;Take heed, and be quiet;
fear not, neither be faint-hearted.&rdquo; Picture
Ahaz restless, excited, his breast
fainting, hope and courage failing. How
timely was the prophet&rsquo;s exhortation!
how helpful it might have been to
Ahaz! Who of us does not know the
blessedness of such an appeal? We have
been excited, trembling, fainting, because
of temporal dangers or spiritual
foes, and in our agitation have been
likely to do something foolish. But a
voice has said, &ldquo;Fear not; be calm!&rdquo;
Who says, &ldquo;Fear not&rdquo;? The loving,
omnipotent Saviour, who is able to
deliver us. 2.&nbsp;<i>By showing His people
the weakness of their foes.</i> They are
only the &ldquo;two tails of smoking firebrands.&rdquo;
You think them powerful,
but they are really weak (1&nbsp;John iv.&nbsp;4).
3.&nbsp;<i>By predicting the failure of the plans of
their foes</i> (vers. 7&ndash;9)&mdash;a prediction which
was fulfilled sixty-five years afterwards,
when Esarhaddon desolated the country,
and filled it with foreigners. So
God shows to us the weakness of our
foes, and predicts their failure. <b>IV.&nbsp;God
shows His people that faith is
necessary for the establishment of
their peace</b> (ver. 9. See also 2&nbsp;Chron.
xx.&nbsp;20; Isa. xxvi.&nbsp;3).&mdash;<i>H.&nbsp;F. Walker.</i></p>

<p class="bq">vii.&nbsp;1&ndash;9. <i>And it came to pass, in the days of Ahaz the son of Jotham, &amp;c.</i></p>

<p><b>I. There are many things calculated
to fill us with fear</b>&mdash;sufferings, losses,
temptations, death, &amp;c. Especially
alarming are combinations of evil:
when they threaten, we are apt to feel
as did Ahaz and his people (ver. 2).
Afflictions seldom come singly: sickness
brings poverty in its train, &amp;c.;
and the heart is apt to fail before such
accumulations of misfortune. <b>II.&nbsp;But
God guarantees the safety of those
who trust in Him.</b> 1.&nbsp;<i>He controls all
events</i> (ver. 7). The Prince of Orange,
when he took the field against France
and the Emperor, said he had made an
alliance with Heaven, and feared not
for the result. Much more may the
believer be confident in the warfare of
life (H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I. 200&ndash;203, 2372, 2373,
4049, 4055&ndash;4058). 2.&nbsp;<i>It is only while
we trust in Him that we are thus in
alliance with Him.</i> Only by trusting in
Him are we kept from trusting in that
which cannot deliver us&mdash;ourselves or
our fellow-men, to the exclusion of God
and the rejection of His proffered help.
<span class="pagenum" id="p151">[p.&nbsp;151]</span>
Only by trusting in Him are our hearts
kept in peace (chap. xxvi.&nbsp;3, H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I.
1893, 1894, 1911&ndash;1919, 1923&ndash;1926).
Only by trusting in Him do we give
Him the glory which is His due, and
which He will not give to another (H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I.
4054). <b>III.&nbsp;The guarantee of
safety which God offers to all who
trust Him extends to the soul as well
as the body.</b> Because of our sins, and
the enemies they bring against us, we
might well fear; but in the Gospel
help is offered, and perfect safety is
guaranteed to them that believe.
<b>IV.&nbsp;The inevitable result of refusal to
accept the help which God mercifully
offers us is ruin.</b> Ahaz, refusing the
sign offered him, and trusting in
Assyria, was overthrown by his ally.
There is deadly peril in any other
alliance than that which God offers
to form with us. Said our Lord to
all who are tempted to apostacy,
&ldquo;Remember Lot&rsquo;s wife,&rdquo; and in like
manner we may say to all who are
tempted to disregard and reject God&rsquo;s
offers of help, <i>Remember Ahaz!</i>&mdash;<i>John Johnston.</i></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 class="tdc" id="o121"><span class="smcap">Purpose and Panics.</span></h3>

<p class="bq">vii.&nbsp;1, 2. <i>And it came to pass, in the days of Ahaz the son of Jotham, &amp;c.</i></p>

<p>In this brief record of <span class="wsnw">events<a id="o121_fna1" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#o121_fn1">[1]</a></span> that
occurred so long ago, we may find
suggestions of truths which it will be
well for us to lay to heart to-day.
<b>I.&nbsp;Men often confidently form purposes
when they find it impossible to fulfil</b>
(ver. 1). Rezin and Pekah no doubt
were sure their project would be successful;
they left no means untried to
make it a success; they had many
things to encourage them (2&nbsp;Chron.
xxviii.&nbsp;5&ndash;7); success seemed certain,
yet they failed! In verse 6 we have
another statement of their purpose,
and in verse 7 we are told the real
reason why it failed: <span class="smcap">God</span> determined
that it should not stand. This is an
illustration of much that takes place
in our own day, in our own life. Purposes
daringly conceived, and wisely
and energetically prosecuted, come to
nothing; and in such cases <span class="smcap">God</span> is
often the real hindrance. He hinders,
not because He has any capricious
delight in frustrating our plans, but
because in them we intend only our
own self-aggrandisement. It is with
our purposes as with our prayers (Jas.
iv.&nbsp;3). If He hinders, no alliance
formed with men can profit us; even
Rezin will help in vain. In forming
our plans, let us remember and
acknowledge our dependence on the
permission and help of God (Jas. iv.&nbsp;13&ndash;15;
Ps. cxxvii.&nbsp;1). If plans should
be formed for our hurt or overthrow,
let us comfort ourselves by remembering
that all men are under God&rsquo;s control.
The confederacy may be very
powerful; most elaborate preparations
may be made for the accomplishment
of its purpose; but there can be no
success unless the Lord will (Dan. iii.&nbsp;16&ndash;18).
<b>II.&nbsp;Men often give way to
unreasonable panics</b> (ver. 2). Panics
are very common, very painful, very
dangerous and hurtful. Their cause:
lack of faith in God. Without faith in
the controlling providence of God, men
are naturally as liable to alarm as is a
wealthy man who on a foggy night has
to make his way through a dangerous
quarter of a strange city; he knows
not whether those footsteps he hears
behind him are those of a policeman
or of a garotter! Firmness is the reward
of faith&mdash;of intelligent confidence
exercised by righteous men in a righteous
God (Ps. iii.&nbsp;6; lvi.&nbsp;11; xci.&nbsp;5;
cxii.&nbsp;7, 8, &amp;c.). Deliverance from fear
is one of the respects in which &ldquo;godliness
has the promise of the life that
now is.&rdquo; This blessing may be yours,
if you will; yours in times of domestic,
of commercial, of national alarm. You
may be delivered, if you will, from the
supreme fear&mdash;fear of death. Christ
came into the world for the purpose of
delivering you from it (Heb. ii.&nbsp;14, 15).
Yield yourself to be really His, and
your end shall be peace (Ps. xxiii.&nbsp;4;
lxxiii.&nbsp;26).</p>

<p class="bq">vii.&nbsp;3&ndash;25. <i>Then said the Lord unto Isaiah, &amp;c.</i></p>

<p>In this interview of Isaiah with
Ahaz we have an instance&mdash;<b>I.&nbsp;Of
God&rsquo;s efforts to turn men from ruinous
courses.</b> God is the great Lawgiver,
and the Judge before whose bar all
impenitent transgressors of His law
will have to stand. Absolute inflexibility
is necessarily His characteristic
in both these capacities. But these are
not the only capacities He seeks to
sustain to us. It is His ambition to
be the Saviour of men from sin and
ruin. Consequently, He does not
merely lay down His law and stand
coldly by, to see whether men will keep
it or not. He plies them with inducements
to keep it. When He sees them
bent on transgression, He endeavours
to arrest them in their foolish and
fatal purpose. Short of that destruction
of the freedom of their will, which
would be the destruction also of their
responsibility and of their possibilities
of virtue, He leaves nothing undone
to turn them from the broad road that
leads to <span class="wsnw">death.<a id="o122_fna1" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#o122_fn1">[1]</a></span>
By adverse providences,
by the strivings of His Holy
Spirit, by awakening conscience to an
active exercise of its functions, He
works upon and in them to will and
to do His good pleasure. No sinner
has ever gone down to perdition unheeded,
unpitied, without attempts to
rescue him. Your own experience
attests the truth of these statements:
you know you had to fight your
way through to those transgressions
of which you are now ashamed. God&rsquo;s
&ldquo;preventing grace&rdquo; is a great fact of
which we should take reverent heed,
and for which we should give fervent
<span class="wsnw">thanks.<a id="o122_fna2" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#o122_fn2">[2]</a></span>
<b>II.&nbsp;Of the manner in
which sinners, by insincere pretences,
resist God&rsquo;s saving purposes.</b> The
stubbornness and insincerity of Ahaz
are <span class="wsnw">obvious.<a id="o122_fna3" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#o122_fn3">[3]</a></span>
But in neither of
these is he singular. Sinners who are
bent on their sins not seldom go on
to the under pretexts of righteousness,
with which they endeavour to
deceive themselves and others. The
greatest crime ever committed was
done under a pretext of righteousness
(Matt. xxvi.&nbsp;65). So has it been with
countless crimes since. Let us be on
our guard against our own hearts (Jer. xvi.&nbsp;9;
Prov. xiv.&nbsp;12) Let us not act
upon any reason which we do not really
believe will bear the scrutiny of God.
<b>III.&nbsp;Of the twofold result which always
follows such resistance to the Divine
purposes.</b> 1.&nbsp;<i>The sinner is, ere long, compelled
to confess that the counsels he set
aside were counsels of truth and wisdom.</i>
In less than three years, Ahaz had
cause to acknowledge the soundness of
the advice to which on this memorable
day he refused to <span class="wsnw">listen.<a id="o122_fna4" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#o122_fn4">[4]</a></span>
A typical case. 2.&nbsp;<i>The obstinate sinner is left to
the ruin from which he would not permit
God to deliver him.</i> There is no salvation
by force. God acts upon our will,
but He will not save us against our
will. Neither shall those who refused
to be saved from sin be saved from its
consequences. If we choose evil, no
act of omnipotence will render the
choice harmless (chap. iii.&nbsp;11). Ahaz
chose the help of Assyria rather than
the help of Jehovah, and with the help
of that great and unscrupulous power
he had to take its domination and destructiveness
(2&nbsp;Chron. xxviii.&nbsp;16, 20).
Again a typical case. The retributive
justice of God is a fact of which it behoves
us to be heedful.</p>

Augustine, in his <i>Confessions,</i> makes
thankful note of the manner in which in the
years of his ungodliness, God had raised up
obstacles in his path of sin. When sinful
desires raged within him, he says, the means
for gratifying them were absent; or when the
desires and the means of gratifying them came
together, some witness was present to deter
him; and when the means were present, and
no witnesses stood by to hinder him, the desire
to transgress was wanting. He rightly judges
that these were no mere accidents or coincidences.</p></div>

<div class="footnote" id="o122_fn2"><p><a href="#o122_fna2"><span class="label">[2]</span></a>
The preventing methods of grace may
deservedly pass for some of the prime instances
of the Divine mercy to men in this world.
For though it ought to be owned for an eminent
act of grace to restore one actually fallen,
<span class="pagenum" id="p153">[p.&nbsp;153]</span>
yet there are not wanting arguments to persuade,
that it is a greater to keep one from
falling. Not to break a limb is more desirable
than to have it set and healed, though never
so skilfully and well. Preservation in this,
as in many other cases, being better a great
deal than restoration; since after all is done,
it is odds but the scar will remain when the
wound is cured and the danger over.&mdash;<i>South.</i></p></div>

<div class="footnote" id="o122_fn3"><p><a href="#o122_fna3"><span class="label">[3]</span></a>
Ahaz listened in sullen and incredulous
silence; and the prophet resumes&mdash;&ldquo;Ask thee
a sign of Jehovah thy God; ask it either in
the depth, or in the height above.&rdquo; But Ahaz,
who looked on Jehovah not as his God, but
only (like any of his heathen neighbours) as
the god of Jud&aelig;a, and as such inferior to the
god of Assyria; and who had determined to
apply to the king of Assyria, or perhaps had
already applied to him, as a more trustworthy
helper than Jehovah, in the present strait; declines
to ask a sign, excusing himself by a
contrary use of the words of Moses, &ldquo;Thou
shalt not tempt Jehovah.&rdquo; He refused the
sign, because he knew it would confirm the
still struggling voice of his conscience; and
that voice he had resolved not to obey, since
it bid him give up the Assyrian, and trust in
Jehovah henceforth.&mdash;<i>Strachey.</i></p></div>

Within the space of time figuratively

of the prophet to become capable of discerning
between good and evil&mdash;<i>i.e.,</i> in about three
years,&mdash;Rezin and Pekah were slain, and the
fact that they were but &ldquo;two tails of smoking
firebrands&rdquo; demonstrated. (See 2&nbsp;Kings xv.&nbsp;27&ndash;30;
xvi.&nbsp;1&ndash;9.)</p></div>

<h3 class="tdc" id="o123"><span class="smcap">A Threefold Counsel.</span></h3>

<p class="bq">vii.&nbsp;4. <i>Take heed, and be quiet; fear not.</i></p>

<p><b>I. &ldquo;Take heed.&rdquo;</b> This is just what
Ahaz fancied he was doing. He was
taking heed to the alliance which had
been formed for his overthrow, and he
was at that very moment doing his
best to frustrate it&mdash;by strengthening
the fortifications of Jerusalem, and by
summoning the king of Assyria to his
help. This seemed to him and his
court supremely wise: it was eminently
foolish. He was taking heed exclusively
to the danger, and had no attention
left for the Divinely-provided defence
against it. That defence lay in
God&rsquo;s promise made to David (2&nbsp;Sam.
vii.&nbsp;12&ndash;16). From one point of view,
it may be said that in allying themselves
for the destruction of the royal
house of David, Rezin, Pekah, and the
son of Tabeal embarked on an enterprise
foredoomed to failure; they might
as well have conspired to prevent the
sun from rising any more in the east.
That the descendants of David should
reign in Jerusalem and that the sun
should rise in the east, were both
guaranteed by the same thing&mdash;the
will and appointment of God. Resistance
was as vain in the one case as in
the other&mdash;that is, while the conditions
attached to the promise made to David
were observed. For there were conditions
attached to it (1&nbsp;Chron. xxviii.&nbsp;9;
2&nbsp;Chron. xv.&nbsp;2). It was to this
great promise and to its essential conditions
that God would have Ahaz
&ldquo;take heed.&rdquo;</p>

<p><i>&ldquo;Take heed&rdquo;</i> is good counsel to give
to every man standing in covenant relations
with God. Many of us stand
in such relations to Him, both as the
result of the relations in which our
parents stood to Him (Ex. xx.&nbsp;6;
Deut. vii.&nbsp;9, &amp;c.), and as the result
of our personal acts; &ldquo;the seed of the
righteous,&rdquo; we have ourselves voluntarily
taken the Lord to be our God,
and have solemnly sworn to walk before
Him in righteousness all the days
of our life. Let us then evermore
&ldquo;take heed&rdquo; to this covenant which
God has condescended to make with
us. It lays upon us great responsibilities,
but it secures to us glorious
privileges. Conspicuous among them
is this that we need not fear the might
of any of our adversaries, whether they
be those of the body or of the soul
(ch. liv.&nbsp;17).</p>

<p><b>II. &ldquo;Be quiet.&rdquo;</b> Or better, &ldquo;<i>And</i> be
quiet.&rdquo; Quietness would follow naturally
from right heed-taking. What
was Ahaz doing? He was straining
every nerve to do for himself what
God had promised to do for him. God
had promised to defend Zion and her
king, and if Ahaz had had faith in
God&rsquo;s promise, the appeal to Assyria
for succour would never had been
made. Alas! how often have better
<span class="pagenum" id="p154">[p.&nbsp;154]</span>
men than Ahaz failed in this very
respect. Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob,
the founders of the Hebrew nation, all
fell into grievous sin through the want
of faith in God&rsquo;s promises which led
them to try to do for themselves what
God had promised to do for them
(cf. Gen. xv.&nbsp;1, and xx.&nbsp;11&ndash;13; xxvi.&nbsp;3
and 7; xxv.&nbsp;23, and xxvii.&nbsp;24).
To what a shameful state of degradation
was David brought by the same
cause (cf. 1&nbsp;Sam. xvi.&nbsp;13 and xxi.&nbsp;12,
13). How many imitators they have
had! God has promised that His
people shall be safe and prosperous;
but not taking heed to His promises,
to how many tricks and devices have
they had recourse to secure for themselves
the blessing God would surely
have sent to them if they had been
obedient and believing, and into what
shame, misery, and ruin have they
plunged <span class="wsnw">themselves.<a id="o123_fna1" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#o123_fn1">[1]</a></span> Let their sins
be to us as beacons; let us &ldquo;take heed&rdquo;
to God&rsquo;s covenant on both its sides,
and be quiet (Ps. xxxvii.&nbsp;3&ndash;9).</p>

<p><b>III. &ldquo;Fear not.&rdquo;</b> Yet there seemed
good reason for fear. It was really a
powerful confederacy that threatened
Ahaz with destruction. Looked at on
its human side, it was no groundless
panic that had smitten him and his
people. Yet the pain of mind and
heart which they endured (ver. 2), they
endured needlessly. They were really
in no danger for their enemies. Their
danger lay only in the unbelief and
stubbornness of their own hearts. They
had but to return to the Lord and they
would find Him a refuge and strong
tower, as their fathers had done aforetime.
<i>&ldquo;Fear not&rdquo;</i> is the counsel which
I give to God&rsquo;s people to-day. Some
of you are fearing greatly; some concerning
temporal things, some lest the
spiritual conflict you are waging should
issue in defeat and eternal ruin. &ldquo;Take
heed&rdquo; to the promises God has made
to you in both these respects; &ldquo;be
quiet,&rdquo; and fret not yourselves in any
wise to do evil; with calm and courageous
hope wait for the fulfilment of
these promises; instead of yielding
to distressing, utterly unnecessary,
and God-dishonouring fears, say with
David (Ps. xxvii.&nbsp;1, xxxiv.&nbsp;22).</p>

<p class="bq">vii&nbsp;4. <i>Take heed.</i></p>

<p>The Hebrew word signifies, to prevent
or keep off any evil with which
we are threatened. The direction
ought to extend to all that we do; for
not one duty can be rightly performed
without diligent attention, and it is no
less incumbent upon us than upon the
king and people of Judah (H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I.
4880&ndash;4890). It is a necessary and
useful caution, which ought to be reduced
to practice at all times, especially
in seasons of perplexity and distress,
such as that wherein Ahaz and his
subjects received this admonition.
1.&nbsp;Take heed to your <i>senses,</i> particularly
what you see and hear; for these are
the avenues by which sin and vanity,
or wisdom and instruction, enter into
the heart (H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I. 4895). 2.&nbsp;Take
heed to your <i>actions,</i> what you do, and
how you act, and for what purpose
you are employed, that you may
happily avoid the many sins and
dangers to which you are exposed,
and attain the great ends which you
ought uniformly to pursue. 3.&nbsp;Take
heed to your <i>tongue,</i> that you sin not
with your mouth; consider wisely
what you say, to whom you speak, and
to what purpose, especially when your
minds are fretted, and when you feel
yourselves under the influence of
timidity and disappointment (P.&nbsp;D.
3558, 3559). 4.&nbsp;Take heed to your
<i>hearts,</i> and keep them with all diligence,
for out of them are the issues
of life; attend to the secret operations
of your minds, and the objects on
which your affections terminate, that
you may perceive whether they are
properly moderated and directed (H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I.
2695&ndash;2705, 4887; P.&nbsp;D. 1735).&mdash;<i>Robert Macculloch:
Lectures on Isaiah,</i> vol. i. p. 395.</p>

<p>&nbsp;<span class="pagenum" id="p155">[p.&nbsp;155]</span></p>
<h3 class="tdc" id="o125"><span class="smcap">Faith, the Condition of Firmness.</span></h3>

<p class="bq">vii.&nbsp;9. <i>If ye will not believe, surely ye shall not be established.</i></p>

<p>&ldquo;Established&rdquo; is what every man
wishes to be&mdash;fixed in fact and in
feeling; established like a great oak
which, because its roots take fast hold
of the soil, is able to grow broader and
higher and more luxuriant year by
year. Such growth is impossible to a
tree that is frequently transplanted.
Notwithstanding&mdash;nay, in perfect harmony
with the desire for progress
that is in us all, we all desire to be
&ldquo;established.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But no man can be &ldquo;established&rdquo;
unless he believes. It is a universal
law: No faith, no firmness. There
are two things essential to &ldquo;establishment,&rdquo;
to blessedness and peace in
life: First, that we should find a good
foundation, and then that we should
rest upon it calmly and immovably.
These are the conditions of social,
commercial, political, and scientific
blessedness and prosperity. In every
realm of human activity, if we would
be strong in fact and in feeling, it is
essential that we should find something
trustworthy, and then that we should
trust (H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I. 1882&ndash;1888).</p>

<p>We are only stating this general
truth in its highest form, when we say
that if men do not believe in God as
He has revealed Himself in His Word,
they cannot be &ldquo;established.&rdquo;
1.&nbsp;God has revealed Himself in His Word
<i>as the righteous Ruler of nations,</i> who
will exalt the nations that seek after
righteousness, and bring swift vengeance
upon those who follow courses
of evil. What will happen if a statesman,
like Ahaz, does not really believe
this? He will become a mere politician;
he will do what seems to
him &ldquo;expedient.&rdquo; This will often be
iniquitous, and this at no distant
period will inevitably lead to disaster
and ruin (P.&nbsp;D. 2544). 2.&nbsp;God has revealed
Himself <i>as the supporter and
rewarder of individual men who are resolved
always and simply to do what is
right.</i> Confidence in God as thus revealed
to them was the secret of the
courage and endurance of the martyrs
(Dan. iii.&nbsp;16&ndash;18), and of countless
sacrifices for truth and righteousness
known only to God, but which He
will never forget. But if a man does
not really believe this truth, how
easily is he swept away by temptation,
whether it presents itself threateningly
or seductively! 3.&nbsp;God has revealed
Himself <i>as, for Christ&rsquo;s sake, pardoning
absolutely all who repent and believe.</i>
Into the hearts of those who accept
this revelation there come peace and
joy, but into their hearts only. Want
of faith in this revelation is the
secret of all painful efforts to merit
the Divine mercy. 4.&nbsp;God reveals
Himself <i>as the Saviour of His people
from sin,</i> as their Sanctifier from all
the stains of iniquity. Want of faith
in this revelation is the secret of the
trouble that fills and oppresses many
devout souls. They will never travel
towards Zion with steadfast feet and
rejoicing hearts until they do indeed
believe it (Jude&nbsp;24, 25). 5.&nbsp;God reveals
Himself in Christ <i>as the Good
Shepherd who is with His people always.</i>
How troubled, because of the possibilities
of life and the mystery of death,
are those who do not with any vital
faith accept this revelation which He
has been pleased to give us! But the
twenty-third Psalm is the song of
those who do believe it (P.&nbsp;D. 1156&ndash;1160).</p>

<p>The practical application of all this
is very simple, but supremely important.
First, let us inquire whether
God is worthy of our trust; and then,
if the inquiry should lead us to an
affirmative conclusion, let us trust
Him. This trust will transform our
whole life. No terrors shall have
power to dismay us. The misery of
Ahaz and his people (ver. 2) we shall
never know (H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I. 1911&ndash;1919); but
ours shall be the rejoicing confidence of
the spiritual hero of whom Ahaz was
such an unworthy descendant (Ps.
xxvii.&nbsp;1&ndash;6; P.&nbsp;D. 1177).</p>

<p>&nbsp;<span class="pagenum" id="p156">[p.&nbsp;156]</span></p>
<h3 class="tdc" id="o126"><span class="smcap">Stability through Faith.</span></h3>

<p class="bq">vii.&nbsp;9. <i>If ye will not believe, surely ye shall not be established.</i></p>

<p>Thus closes the address of Isaiah to
Ahaz and his people on a very memorable
and trying occasion.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Its
meaning is, Take God at His word;
place entire reliance upon Him, and
not upon an arm of flesh. If ye will
not do this as a country, the state cannot
be safe; and if you will not do this
as individuals, your minds cannot be
composed and established. Now, let
us pass from the house of David naturally
to the house of David spiritually,
and pursue the train of thought set in
motion. Let us consider the stability
of faith, and the peace it induces. In
the Christian&rsquo;s life there are three
kinds of stability. <b>I.&nbsp;There is a stability
of judgment.</b> This regards the
<i>truths</i> of religion. It is of great importance
to have a judgment clear and
fixed, as it respects the great concerns
of the soul and eternity, and the great
doctrines of the Gospel of Christ; for
as we think we feel, as we feel we
desire, and as we desire we act, and as we
act our characters are formed and
our conditions determined. Instability
concerning these great truths is both
perilous and painful; but whence is
stability to come? Not through human
authority; for what one patronises,
another denies. Not through human
reason (H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I. 537, 1087, 2022&ndash;2024;
P.&nbsp;D. 2926, 2929, 2931, 2934). There
must be a revelation received by faith;
Divine declarations, believed because
God has made them. This leads to an
experience which tends still further to
establish the Christian in the faith (H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I.
1087, 1142&ndash;1148). <b>II.&nbsp;There is
a stability of practice.</b> This regards
the <i>duties</i> of religion (1&nbsp;Pet. i.&nbsp;5). In
order to see the strength and beauty
of the sentiment contained in the text,
let us place the believer in three positions.
1.&nbsp;In a place of <i>secrecy.</i> To
many this is a place of temptation.
Not so to the believer. Faith brings
God and places Him before us (Gen.
xvi.&nbsp;13; xxxix.&nbsp;9). 2.&nbsp;<i>In prosperity
and indulgence</i> (Prov. i.&nbsp;32). But faith
brings to the Christian the earnests of
a better country, the first-fruits and
foretastes of it, and thus gives him a
victory which others can never achieve
(1&nbsp;John v.&nbsp;4). 3.&nbsp;In a condition of
<i>suffering and danger</i> (Heb. xi.&nbsp;24&ndash;27;
Dan. vi.&nbsp;10; H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I. 1911&ndash;1919).
<b>III.&nbsp;There is a stability of hope.</b> This
regards the <i>comforts</i> of religion (Rom.
xv.&nbsp;13; 1&nbsp;Pet. i.&nbsp;8; Ps. xxiii.&nbsp;1, 4, 6).
1.&nbsp;<i>Beware of unbelief.</i> It is a grievous
offence against God; it is hurtful and
perilous to man. Every sin renders
our salvation impossible by the law,
but only one sin renders it impossible
by the Gospel, and that is unbelief;
not by any desire or threatening of
God, but by its natural tendency and
result. For there is only one remedy
that can restore a perishing sinner,
and if this be rejected, destruction is
inevitable (H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I. 443). 2.&nbsp;<i>Labour
and pray for an increase of faith</i> (Mark
ix.&nbsp;23; 2&nbsp;Chron. xx.&nbsp;20).&mdash;<i>William Jay:
Sunday Morning Sermons,</i> pp. 101&ndash;109.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 class="tdc" id="o127"><span class="smcap">Man&rsquo;s Imagined Independence of God.</span></h3>

<p class="bq">vii.&nbsp;12. <i>But Ahaz said, I will not ask, neither will I tempt the Lord.</i></p>

<p>We are commanded to ask for all
we need and desire (Matt. vii.&nbsp;7; Phil.
iv.&nbsp;6). But many say, &ldquo;I will not
ask.&rdquo; <b>I.&nbsp;Men are apt to act thus
when possessed of earthly resources.</b>
How hard it is for a man of wealth
to pray, &ldquo;Give us this day our daily
bread!&rdquo; He has much goods laid up
for many years. How natural for a
man in health and prosperity thus to
forget his dependence on God (H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I.
4000, 4001). Even in trouble a
man is apt to look elsewhere for aid:
<i>e.g.,</i> in sickness to the physician; even
when convinced of sin, to his own
efforts, or to a human priest. <b>II.&nbsp;Men</b>
<span class="pagenum" id="p157">[p.&nbsp;157]</span>
<b>often act thus on the pretence of not
tempting God.</b> On the ground that
their affairs are beneath His notice
(H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I. 4015&ndash;4025, 2245&ndash;2248, 2325,
3226, 3403). On the ground that God
has already established the laws by
which all things are regulated (H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I.
3179&ndash;3182, 3751, 3752, 3757).
<b>III.&nbsp;But the real reasons why men act
thus are because they trust in themselves,
and have no real faith in God.</b>
The real reason why Ahaz did not ask
was because he was bent on forming
an alliance with Assyria. Let it be
ours gratefully to accept the privilege
so graciously offered, seeing that God
has given us far more than was given
to Ahaz: we have all the great and
precious promises contained in the
Scriptures, the knowledge of the unspeakable
gift of God&rsquo;s dear Son, the
accumulated experience of all generations
of His faithfulness as the hearer
of prayer. We may have our own
experience of it; if we will but ask,
we shall receive. How much greater
our sin than that of Ahaz, if in these
circumstances we say, &ldquo;I will not
ask!&rdquo;&mdash;<i>John Johnston.</i></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 class="tdc" id="o128"><span class="smcap">Momentous Decisions.</span></h3>

<p class="bq">vii.&nbsp;12. <i>But Ahaz said, I will not ask, &amp;c.</i></p>

<p>In studying what the commentators
have to say about this chapter, I met
with a sentence that set me thinking.
It was this: &ldquo;In that very hour, in
which Isaiah was standing before
Ahaz, the fate of Jerusalem was decided
for more than two thousand
years&rdquo; (<i>Delitzsch</i>). <b>I.&nbsp;How true is this
declaration!</b> Ahaz was called upon
to choose between the alliance with
Assyria and alliance with God. His
choice was announced in these four
words, &ldquo;I will not ask;&rdquo; then he decided
against God, and all the disasters
which have come upon Jerusalem since
that day have been in a very real sense
the result of that fatal decision.
<b>II.&nbsp;How typical is this incident!</b> How
often men, like Ahaz, arrive at decisions
which are irrevocable, and unspeakably
momentous! 1.&nbsp;To have to
make decisions that may be solemn in
both these senses is one of the things
that make the position of a ruler or
statesman so serious. Not to be coveted
are the positions in which a man&rsquo;s
resolves and utterances become fateful
for whole peoples. But Pharaoh was
in such a position, and like Ahaz he
made a fatal mistake (Exod. x.&nbsp;28).
2.&nbsp;Few are called to fill positions
of such responsibility, but every man is
at some juncture called to make a
decision the results of which to him
individually will be of unspeakable
importance. The Young Ruler arrived
at such a juncture, and made such
a decision. Every one of you will at
some moment be called upon to decide
for or against Christ, and the decision
will be final and irreversible. The
fact that it is so will probably not be
suspected by you; you will decide
against Christ, in the expectation of
reversing the decision on some other
occasion, <i>which will never come to you.</i>
This decision you <i>may</i> make now;
it is the undeniable possibility which
makes the preaching and hearing of
the Gospel so solemn a thing. This
supreme decision may be made by you
in another manner. The test may
come to you in another form&mdash;in the
shape of a temptation appealing to
some passion of the mind or lust of
the flesh, and your eternal destiny may
be determined by the manner in which
you deal with that <i>one</i> temptation (H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I.
4737, 4738, 4636). 3.&nbsp;Like a
railway train, we are continually
arriving at &ldquo;points,&rdquo; and the manner
in which we &ldquo;take&rdquo; them affects our
whole after career. This is true in
regard to many things, unspeakably
inferior in importance to the questions
of surrender or non-surrender to Christ,
or of loyalty or disloyalty to Him, but
yet of marvellous influence in determining
<span class="pagenum" id="p158">[p.&nbsp;158]</span>
whether our after life is to
be happy or miserable: business, social
and domestic relations.</p>

<p>In view of these facts&mdash;that so much
may depend upon any decision
we make, and that it is absolutely concealed
from us <i>which</i> decisions are
final and irrevocable&mdash;what is it that,
as wise men, it becomes us to do?
<b>1.&nbsp;Let us settle each question that is put
before us in the spirit of righteousness.</b>
Always let us ask only, What
is <i>right?</i> (1.)&nbsp;This is the only path
of <i>safety.</i> (2.)&nbsp;By this path <i>heroism</i> is
reached, and <i>world-wide influence</i> may
be reached. We think of Moses (Heb.
xi.&nbsp;24&ndash;27), of the Apostles (Acts iv.&nbsp;19,
20), and of Luther before the Diet of
Worms, as heroes; but <i>they</i> had no
such thought&mdash;their only thought was
that of fidelity to duty; and it is thus
only that true heroism can be reached
(P.&nbsp;D. 1189). <b>2.&nbsp;Let us day by day
commit ourselves to the guidance of
God,</b> praying Him to strengthen our conscience,
to sanctify our desires, and so
to &ldquo;work in us both to will and to do
of His good pleasure.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 class="tdc" id="o129"><span class="smcap">Irreligious Piety.</span></h3>

<p class="bq">vii.&nbsp;12. <i>But Ahaz said, I will not ask, neither will I tempt the Lord.</i></p>

<p>Ahaz here poses as a better man
than the prophet. He refuses to
follow the direction which Isaiah has
given him, and refuses, because he
alleges, to do so would be wrong.
His disregard of what he knows to be
a Divine direction, he covers by an
appeal to a general principle which
God has been pleased to give for our
guidance (Deut. vi.&nbsp;16). Thus he
sought to silence the reproaches of
conscience within, and of good men
without. We may take him as the
representative of that large class of
persons who for their actions assign reasons
that really are not their governing
motives, and cover wrong actions by
what appear to be cloaks of righteousness,
but really are cloaks of hypocrisy.</p>

<p>How numerous these people are!
We find them in all ranks of life;
there is this skilful use of pretexts
in all realms of human activity.
<b>1.&nbsp;Social life,</b>&mdash;<i>e.g.,</i> A man rejects
a suitor for his daughter&rsquo;s hand, the
suitor being forty-five years of age
and the daughter twenty-two, professedly
for the excellent reason that
too great a disparity in age between
man and wife is not desirable but
really because the suitor is not sufficiently
wealthy. <b>2.&nbsp;Business,</b>&mdash;<i>e.g.,</i>
A man refuses to become security for
another, because, he says, he has entered
into an undertaking with his
partners not to incur any such responsibility,
and because it is important
that deeds of partnership should be
honourably observed; really because
he had no wish to oblige the man
who asks his aid. <b>3.&nbsp;Politics.</b>&mdash;Why,
this is a form of activity which has
to a large extent ceased to be care
for the welfare of the city or of the
community, and has to the same extent
become a game of pretexts, in
which broad and great principles are
used to cover petty and personal ends.
<b>4.&nbsp;Religion.</b>&mdash;Alas! into this realm
also men carry the same spirit and
practices. Let us look at some of the
prevalent forms of irreligious piety.
(1.)&nbsp;There is the man who will not
make any confession of Christ, because
&ldquo;religion is a thing between a man&rsquo;s
own soul and God.&rdquo; (2.)&nbsp;There is the
man who will not join the church,
because the members of the church are
so inconsistent, and inconsistent Christians
are among the greatest of all
hindrances to the progress of Christianity.
(3.)&nbsp;There is the man who
never attends a week-evening service,
because &ldquo;there is no real religion in
neglecting one&rsquo;s daily duties, and we
are expressly told that we are to be
diligent in business.&rdquo; The same man,
however, finds it neither impossible
nor inconsistent with his duties to attend
political meetings and popular
<span class="pagenum" id="p159">[p.&nbsp;159]</span>
concerts. (4.)&nbsp;There is the man who
never subscribes to any foreign missionary
society, because &ldquo;religion, like
charity, should begin at home, and
even in this so-called Christian land
there are millions of practical heathen
who need to have the Gospel preached to
them.&rdquo; How much does this man contribute
towards home missions?
(5.)&nbsp;There is the man who will not contribute
towards any church-building fund, because
he does not &ldquo;believe in bricks
and mortar,&rdquo; and because &ldquo;true religion
before God and the Father is&mdash;not to
build costly sanctuaries&mdash;but to help the
fatherless and widows in their affliction,
and to keep oneself unspotted from
the world&rdquo; (cf. John xii.&nbsp;4&ndash;6).
(6.)&nbsp;There is the man who has no hesitation
in joining in a Sunday excursion,
because &ldquo;the Sabbath was made for
man, not man for the Sabbath,&rdquo; and
because&mdash;the two pleas almost always
go together&mdash;&ldquo;it is possible to worship
God as truly in the great temple of
nature as in any temple built by man.&rdquo;
Picture the man as he actually &ldquo;worships
God in the great temple of
nature;&rdquo; and inquire how he feels on
Monday after what he calls &ldquo;a little
relaxation on the Sunday.&rdquo; (7.)&nbsp;There
is the man who indulges freely in what
many people consider worldly amusements,
because &ldquo;it is not well to be
too strait-laced; Solomon, indeed,
warns us against being righteous over-much;
and there is nothing so likely
as Pharisaism to disgust young people
with religion&rdquo; (H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I. 5038&ndash;5043).</p>

<p>So we might go on with this miserable
catalogue. Satan, we are told
appears sometimes in the guise of an
angel of light, and in this respect his
children are wonderfully like him;
they are marvellously ingenious in
using holy principles to cover unholy
purposes. But what does all this ingenuity
amount to? Whom do they
succeed in deceiving? Not men for
any length of time. The wolf never
succeeds in long completely covering
itself with the sheep&rsquo;s clothing. The
mask of the hypocrite will slip aside.
And when it does so, men despise him
for wearing it. Did he show himself
as he is, men might, would, condemn
him; but they would not despise him so
much. And God&mdash;He is never deceived.
He loathes the false pretenders to righteousness;
and ere long He will strip
them bare, and expose them to the
execration of the universe (H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I.,
3017&ndash;3032; P.&nbsp;D., 1923, 1924, 1930).</p>

<p>What is the practical lesson to be
learned from the whole? To pray that
God will help us in all things to be
sincere; to live, &ldquo;as seeing Him who is
invisible,&rdquo; remembering that <i>He</i> sees
what is invisible&mdash;the motives underlying
the actions that are seen of men.
Nothing else can win for us from
Christ the priceless commendation,
&ldquo;Behold an Israelite indeed, in whom
is no guile!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 class="tdc" id="o130"><span class="smcap">Trials of the Divine Patience.</span></h3>

<p class="bq">vii.&nbsp;13. <i>Will ye weary my God also?</i></p>

<p>In this chapter we are told under
what circumstances this question came
to be asked. An astonishing assumption
underlies it, viz., that anything
can be a weariness to God, that anything
can be a trial of the Divine
patience. Let us think of this.</p>

<p><b>I. It is a wonderful and glorious
thing that there is a Divine patience
to be tried.</b> This is a distinctively
Biblical idea. Uninstructed by the
Scriptures, men naturally think of
God as doing as He pleases and when
He pleases,&mdash;His pleasure being always
a selfish one; a Divinity of Power
who permits nothing to arrest or delay
His purposes, crushing every obstacle
as an express train dashes through or
over a flock of sheep that has strayed
on to its track. Or if men seem with
impunity from a time to disregard or
defy Him, this is only because He is
indifferent to them, caring nothing
what they do, because He knows that
whensoever He pleases He can destroy
them. But in this Book we are
<span class="pagenum" id="p160">[p.&nbsp;160]</span>
taught to think of Him as profoundly
interested in what men do, as grieved
and provoked by what they do, and as
not merely resisting the impulse to
destroy them, but as feeling no such
impulse; as longing over them with
yearning desire that they would, by
repentance and reformation render it
possible for Him righteously to abstain
from dealing with them according to
their desserts. The <i>forbearance</i> of God
is a conception which we find only in
this Book and that should excite our
wonder, our thankfulness, our love.
This forbearance of God&mdash;this marvellous
Divine patience with sinful men&mdash;what
is its secret and explanation?
It is the <i>love</i> which God has for us.
Love is slow to <span class="wsnw">strike.<a id="o130_fna1" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#o130_fn1">[1]</a></span></p>

<p><b>II. It is a sad and terrible thing
that the Divine patience should be
tried.</b> There are some offences that
are horrible, because they outrage even
our imperfect sense of what is fitting,
<i>e.g.,</i> to falsely direct a blind man, so
that he shall fall over a precipice; to
kill a hunted creature that has fled
to us for protection. But of all these
outrages, the vilest are sins against
love. This is the supremely loathsome
thing in seduction, that it is a sin
against uninstructed but trustful love.
Our whole soul rises in disgust against
the brutal wretch who smites to the
earth the mother who bore and nursed
him. But when we think of what
God is, as He is presented to us in
scriptures, we see that most heedlessness
to His appeals, and warnings,
and entreaties, of which we are apt
to think so little, is really a horrible
offence, because it is a sin against a
love the depth and tenderness of
which is but faintly imaged forth to
us by the purest and most fervent
human affection. Persistence in wrong-doing&mdash;we
see its hatefulness even
when it is maintained in spite of human
love: the prodigal hardening himself
against his mother&rsquo;s entreaties to reform.
But what must we say of it as
maintained against the entreaties of a
love that is more sensitive than any
mother&rsquo;s, and that it is rendered so
wonderful by the fact that it is associated
with a power that could instantly
destroy? It is so startling and
so horrible that it ought to be impossible.
But&mdash;</p>

<p><b>III. The Divine patience is often
tried.</b> Sins against it are common.
In this respect Ahaz does not stand
alone. Men commit such sins without
compunction. Have we not done so?
With what contempt and indifference
we have treated God&rsquo;s expostulations
with us! We have deferred the duty
of repentance. Why? Very much
because we know that God is patient,
and will not be swift to take vengeance
upon us. We have practised
on His forbearance, and thus have been
guilty of the basest crime that is possible;
we have deliberately sinned
against love. Yet we are not troubled;
so possible it is to drug conscience;
so delusive is peace of conscience in
the impenitent. But let us look at
our conduct as God must regard it, as
any reasonable and holy intelligence
must regard it, and let us humble ourselves
before Him against whom we
have sinned so <span class="wsnw">basely.<a id="o130_fna2" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#o130_fn2">[2]</a></span></p>

<p><b>IV. Those who tire out the Divine
patience shall find themselves righteously
confronted by the Divine</b>
<span class="wsnw"><b>justice.</b><a id="o130_fna3" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#o130_fn3">[3]</a></span>
God will not be permanently
mocked. He would be unworthy of
His position if He permitted sin to go
<span class="wsnw">unpunished.<a id="o130_fna4" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#o130_fn4">[4]</a></span>
What the punishment of sin is we do not know,
because we are now living in an
economy in which justice is tempered
by mercy. Yet in the calamities and
unspeakable woes that here and now
befall obdurate transgressors, we have
some faint intimation of what will be
their doom when, having rejected
mercy, they find themselves given over
to the unmitigated rigours of justice.
Of these things God has spoken because
He would save us from them.
All the threatenings of Scripture are
merciful <span class="wsnw">warnings.<a id="o130_fna5" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#o130_fn5">[5]</a></span>
Let us give heed to them, and return to Him who
has declared with equal clearness and
emphasis that He will by no means
clear the guilty, and that He has no
delight in the death of the
<span class="wsnw">sinner.<a id="o130_fna6" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#o130_fn6">[6]</a></span></p>

<p>Where men are bent upon wrong there is
always a strong tendency to elect a character
of God that is not very just, but that is very
kind&mdash;so kind that behind it they may gain
some security in their wrong course. And
when God&rsquo;s long-suffering and patience are
opened up to men they often say, &ldquo;Well, if
God is a being that is tender and loving, I
need not be in a hurry to leave off my evil
ways. He will bear with me a little longer,
and I do not believe that He will account
with me for my petty transgressions.&rdquo; Men
deliberately employ God&rsquo;s mercy and goodness
to violate His feelings.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. That is infernal;
it is inhuman, because kindness seems to lay
almost every man under a debt of gratitude.
A dog, even, feels itself laid under a debt of
gratitude by kindness. It is only men who
are corrupted that would ever think of making
goodness, and kindness, and generosity
towards them the ground on which to base
a violation of these qualities. And yet hundreds
say, &ldquo;God is good, and we will go on
a little longer in sin.&rdquo; Yes, He is
infinitely good. He has been patient with
you; He has longed for you; He has sent
ten thousand invisible mercies to you, besides
those visible mercies he has showered upon
you; He has been long-suffering and forgiving;
He has sunk in the depths of the sea
thrice ten thousands of transgressions; He
did it yesterday, He is doing it to-day, and
He will do it to-morrow; and shall you argue
with yourself that because God is so good you
will go on and insult Him, and wound Him,
and injure Him? Or shall the goodness of
God lead you to repentance and newness of
life? I beseech of you, for the sake of honour
and manhood, do not tread upon God&rsquo;s goodness,
and generosity, and magnanimity to
offend Him more.&mdash;<i>Beecher.</i></p></div>

<h3 class="tdc" id="o131"><span class="smcap">The Virgin&rsquo;s Son.</span></h3>

<p class="bq">vii.&nbsp;13&ndash;16. <i>And he said, Hear ye now, O house of David, &amp;c.</i></p>

<p>On this supremely difficult passage
Dr. Kennicott preached a remarkable
sermon before the University of Oxford,
on the 19th of May 1765. As
this sermon is not readily accessible, I
here give some extracts from it.</p>

<p class="gap">Concerning these words there have been
the four following opinions:&mdash;</p>

<p>I. That the whole passage relates only to a
son of Isaiah.</p>

<p>II. That the whole passage relates only to
<span class="smcap">Christ.</span></p>

<p>III. That the whole passage relates both to
Isaiah&rsquo;s son and to <span class="smcap">Christ;</span> to the former in a
primary and literal sense, and in a secondary
sense to the latter.</p>

<p>IV. That there are here <i>two</i> prophecies, each
literal, and each to be understood in one sense
only: the first relating to <span class="smcap">Christ,</span> the second
to Isaiah&rsquo;s son.</p>

<p class="gap">The first of these opinions is strenuously
contended for by Jews and Deists, who, by
confining this passage wholly to Isaiah&rsquo;s son,
have attempted to derogate from the authority
of St. Matthew, who applies it as a prophecy
to <span class="smcap">Christ.</span> But the word here translated
<i>virgin</i> signifies, in every other part of the Old
Testament, a <i>woman who hath not known man.</i>
And the consequence from hence is, that the
words &ldquo;a virgin shall conceive, and bear a
son,&rdquo; cannot be applied properly to Isaiah&rsquo;s
wife. As it is here affirmed that the original
word signifies a <i>virgin</i> in every other text, it
should be just observed that the text in the
book of Proverbs (xxx.&nbsp;18, 19), which has been
often brought to prove the contrary, is not
here forgotten; and that even <i>that</i> text might
(if the nature of this discourse would permit)
be explained fairly and to satisfaction, in a
manner perfectly consistent with the preceding
assertion.</p>

<p>If it should be objected, that the original
words are not future, and therefore not likely
to point out an event so very distant as
the birth of <span class="smcap">Christ,</span> it may be answered that the
words are, strongly translated, &ldquo;Behold! a
virgin is conceiving and bearing a son,&rdquo; &amp;c.
This mode of speech is the animated but customary
style of prophetic Scripture, which, in
order to express the greatest certainty, describes
future events as <i>past,</i> or paints future scenes
as <i>present</i> to the eye. Thus the same prophet,
in his most magnificent predictions of the
Messiah&rsquo;s birth, exultingly cries, &ldquo;Unto us a
child <span class="smcap">is born,</span> unto us a son <span class="smcap">is given</span>:&rdquo; and
afterwards, in his pathetic description of the
Messiah&rsquo;s sufferings, &ldquo;He is despised and rejected
of men.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Surely He <span class="smcap">hath borne</span>
our griefs,&rdquo; &amp;c. But though no argument can
be drawn against the Christian sense of these
prophetic words from their expressing the then
present time, yet an argument of great weight
may, and must be, formed upon this very circumstance,
in proof of what is here contended
for. And certainly, if the words mean <i>&ldquo;a
virgin is conceiving,&rdquo;</i> a woman conceiving was
yet a virgin! this wonderful circumstance was
true as to the Virgin Mary, but it was true as
to no other woman.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="p162">[p.&nbsp;162]</span>
To these remarks upon the original language
must be added one arising from the circumstances
of the text, for we learn from thence
likewise that Isaiah&rsquo;s wife and the birth of a
child in the common way cannot have been
here intended. And an appeal may safely be
made to persons of sense, though wholly unacquainted
with the Hebrew language, whether
it is at all probable that the prophet should
address himself to the house of David so
solemnly, on so interesting an occasion; should
awaken their attention; should raise their
wonder; should promise them in the name of
<span class="smcap">God</span> <i>a sign</i> or <i>miracle;</i> should mention the
future son, not of a <i>man</i> (as usual) but of a
<i>woman,</i> and call that woman <i>a virgin;</i> and
should foretell the Birth of <span class="smcap">Immanuel,</span> <i>i.e.,</i>
<span class="smcap">God with us</span>&mdash;and yet that no more was meant
by all this than that <i>a son should be born of a
young married woman,</i> which is evidently no
wonder, no miracle, at all.</p>

<p class="gap">If then, from this constant signification of
the noun for <i>virgin,</i> from the expression of the
words in the <i>present</i> tense, and from the nature
of the context, a son of Isaiah by his wife
cannot have been here meant; and if the first
opinion be consequently proved indefensible,
we may now proceed to consider the <i>second,</i>
which is that the whole passage of the text
relates only to <span class="smcap">Christ.</span></p>

<p>But these words cannot be wholly applied
to an event distant by more than seven hundred
years, because the concluding clause speaks of
a child either then born, or to be born soon;
and before the child so spoken of should be
old enough to distinguish natural good from
evil, the two kings then advancing against
Jerusalem were to be themselves destroyed.</p>

<p class="gap">The <i>third</i> is the option of those who contend
for a <i>double</i> completion of some prophecies,
and insist that this whole passage
relates both to Isaiah&rsquo;s son and to <span class="smcap">Christ;</span> to
the former in a primary and literal sense, and
in a secondary sense to the latter. But&mdash;not
to enter into that extensive question, whether
though some prophecies relate solely to the
Messiah, others may, or may not, be doubly
fulfilled&mdash;I shall only observe, that no such
double completion can possibly take place here.</p>

<p>Whether a secondary sense is insisted on,
there we must have a primary sense also which
is at least <i>true.</i> But the present case renders
that impossible. Because, if the principle
noun does everywhere else signify a <i>virgin;</i>
and if it be here meant of the Virgin Mary,
and was afterwards properly applied to <i>her,</i> it
cannot with any truth be applied to the wife
of Isaiah. And further, if it were possible for
<i>every other</i> prophecy to admit of a double completion,
yet will not <i>this</i>&mdash;because a child&rsquo;s
being conceived and born of a virgin happened
in the world only <i>once;</i> and therefore, as this
prophecy derives its force from specifying a
case <i>singular and without example,</i> it can be
fulfilled in <i>one</i> sense only.</p>

<p class="gap">There remains then the <i>fourth</i> opinion, which
is, that the text contains <i>two</i> distinct prophecies,
each literal, and each to be understood
in one sense only; the first relating to <span class="smcap">Christ,</span>
the second to Isaiah&rsquo;s son. This, which is the
opinion of some eminent defenders of Christianity,
will (I presume) appear true and satisfactory,
when the end of the first prophecy,
and the beginning of the second, shall have
been properly considered; and when some
proofs which seem absolutely necessary, but
perhaps were never yet produced, shall have
been added to former observations.</p>

<p>The genuine sense of this passage depending
greatly on the circumstances of those to whom
it was delivered, it is here necessary to state
the history.</p>

<p>Ahaz became King of Judah when the people
were greatly corrupted, and he himself was
strongly inclined to idolatry. To correct,
therefore, both king and people, God permitted
a powerful confederacy to take place between
Rezin, king of Syria, and Pekah, king of
Israel; who, growing jealous of their formidable
neighbour, invaded Jud&aelig;a in the first year
of Ahaz; and so successfully, that above 100,000
of the men of Ahaz were slain in the battle,
and above 200,000 of his people were carried
captives into the land of Israel.</p>

<p>Flushed with these successes, the two kings
thought that Jerusalem itself would soon become
an easy prey to their power; and in the
second year of Ahaz marched towards it, with
a resolution totally to abolish the royal succession,
which had been for twelve generations
in the house of David, and to establish, in the
holy city, a heathen king, a Syrian, &ldquo;the son
of Tabeal.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At the approach of these confederates, &ldquo;the
heart of Ahaz was moved, and the hearts of
all his people, as the trees of the wood are
moved with the wind.&rdquo; The consternation
was universal, and no wonder. For the young
king and the corrupt part of his people would
easily be led, from the sufferings they had
felt, to fear greater. And the religious part
of the nation would entertain fears still more
alarming, fears of the extinction of the house
of David; for were that house to fall, then
farewell to all their glorious hope of a Messiah,
a son of David, who was to reign for
ever. These men, therefore, no doubt, &ldquo;cried
unto the Lord in their distresses,&rdquo; and expostulated
with Him concerning &ldquo;the sure
mercies of David:&rdquo; &ldquo;Lord, where are Thy
old loving-kindnesses, which Thou swearest
unto David in Thy truth?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Amidst these distresses, we find Ahaz &ldquo;at
the end of the conduit of the upper pool,&rdquo;
probably surveying that chief source of their
water, and contriving how to secure that water
to the city, and defend it against the enemy.
At this place, constantly frequented by the
people, and then visited by the king, attended
probably by the chiefs of his family, Isaiah is
commanded to meet him, taking with him
Shear-jashub, and to declare in the name of
Jehovah, that the evil counsel against Jerusalem
should not come to pass.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="p163">[p.&nbsp;163]</span>
The counsel of these kings was evil, because,
in opposition to God&rsquo;s appointment of
the royal house of David, and His promises
thereto (particularly of Messiah, the Prince,
to spring from thence), their compact was,
probably, like Eastern conquerors, to destroy
the house of David; certainly, to remove the
house of David from the throne, and to fix
in the holy city a heathen king.</p>

<p>The prophet, having declared to Ahaz that
the scheme of the confederates should be frustrated,
bids him, at the command of God, ask
some sign or miracle, either in heaven or on
earth. &ldquo;But Ahaz said, I will not ask,
neither will I tempt Jehovah.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The king&rsquo;s disobedience, however coloured
over with a specious piety in his allusion to
a text of Scripture, appears from the next
words of the prophet to have been highly censurable.
And it probably proceeded from his
distrust either of the power or the favour of
Jehovah, after Jud&aelig;a had suffered so much
from these same enemies who worshipped
other gods.</p>

<p>Thus repulsed by the king, the prophet
addresses himself at large to &ldquo;the house of
David;&rdquo; and probably there were then present
other persons of the royal family.
&ldquo;Hear ye now, O house of David,&rdquo; &amp;c.</p>

<p>The word <i>&ldquo;Therefore&rdquo;</i> (ver. 14) may, upon
good authority, be translated <i>&ldquo;nevertheless,&rdquo;</i>
a sense very applicable to this place. A sign
or miracle hath been now offered at the command
of God, but is refused; and can <i>you</i>
think it of little moment to treat with such
contempt both the prophet and his God?
&ldquo;<i>Nevertheless,</i> the Lord Himself will give to
<i>you</i> the sign following: Behold, a virgin
shall conceive, and bear a son, and call His
name <span class="smcap">Immanuel.</span> Butter and honey shall He
eat, that He may know to refuse the evil, and
choose the good.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Here, I presume, ends this first prophecy,
and the meaning may be stated thus: &ldquo;Fear
not, O house of David, the fate threatened you.
God is mindful of His promise to your father,
and will fulfil it in a very wonderful manner.
Behold, a virgin (rather, <span class="smcap">the</span> virgin, the only
one thus circumstanced) shall conceive, and
bear a son; which son shall therefore be what
no other has been or shall be, the seed of the
woman, here styled <span class="smcap">the virgin;</span> and this son
&lsquo;shall be called&rsquo; (<i>i.e.,</i> in Scripture language,
<i>He shall be</i>) <span class="smcap">Immanuel,</span> God with us. But
this great Person, this <span class="smcap">God</span> visible amongst
men, introduced into the world thus, in a
manner that is without example, shall yet be
truly <i>Man:</i> He shall be born an infant, and
as an infant shall He be brought up; for
&lsquo;butter and honey&rsquo; (rather, milk and honey)
shall He eat,&mdash;He shall be fed with the common
food of infants, which in the East was
milk mixed with honey, till He shall know
(<i>not</i> that He <i>may</i> know, as if such food were
to be the cause of such knowledge, but <i>till</i> He
shall grow up to know) how to refuse the evil
and choose the good.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Here, then, we find a comprehensive description
of the Messiah, of the &ldquo;Word who
was made flesh and dwelt among us.&rdquo; His
Divinity is marked by His being <span class="smcap">God;</span> His
residence upon earth, by His being <span class="smcap">God with
us;</span> and His Humanity, by His being born of
a woman, and fed with the usual food of infants
during His infant state. How perfect
is the harmony between the parts of this description
and the marks of the true Messiah
in other sacred passages; and also between
the first prophecy in the very beginning of the
Old Testament and the completion of it, first
mentioned in the very beginning of the New!</p>

<p>For the first promise of a Messiah was, that
He should be (not the seed of Adam, as He
would have been called, if to descend from a
human father, but) &ldquo;the seed of the woman,&rdquo;
because He was to be born of a virgin. Therefore,
the Apostle says, &ldquo;When the fulness of
time came, God sent forth His Son, made of a
woman.&rdquo; And that it was <span class="smcap">God,</span> not man,
who was to &ldquo;prepare a body&rdquo; for the Messiah,
appears from the fortieth Psalm, according
to the Apostle&rsquo;s very remarkable quotation
of it, where the Messiah is prophetically
represented as saying unto God: &ldquo;A body
didst Thou prepare for Me; then said I, Lo,
I come; as in the volume of the Book it is
written concerning Me.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="gap">Having thus endeavoured to illustrate the
first prophecy contained in the text, and to
defend the application of it to the Virgin
Mary&rsquo;s conception and birth of Jesus Christ,
I shall now briefly state the second prophecy,
which is thus expressed in our present translation,
&ldquo;For before the child shall know to
refuse the evil and choose the good, the land
that thou abhorrest shall be forsaken of both
her kings.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Now, that this verse contains a distinct
prophecy may be proved thus&mdash;</p>

<p>1. The words preceding have been proved
to be confined to the Messiah, whose birth
was then distant above seven hundred years:
whereas, the words <i>here</i> are confined to some
child who was not to arrive at years of discretion
before the two kings, then advancing
against Jerusalem, should be themselves cut
off.</p>

<p>2. Some end was undoubtedly to be answered
by the presence of Isaiah&rsquo;s son, whom God
commanded to take with him on this visit to
Ahaz; and yet no use at all appears to have
been made of this son, unless he is referred
to here.</p>

<p>3. These prophecies are manifestly distinguished
by their being addressed to different
persons: the first being <i>plural,</i> and addressed
to the house of David; but the second is <i>singular,</i>
and therefore is addressed to Ahaz.</p>

<p>We see, then, that the prophet addressed
himself at large to the &ldquo;house of David,&rdquo;
when he foretold the birth of the Messiah;
which, though the event might be very distant,
would give present consolation, as it
assured them of the preservation of the house
of David; but that he addressed himself in
<span class="pagenum" id="p164">[p.&nbsp;164]</span>
particular to the king, when he foretold the
speedy destruction of the two kings, his enemies.
Note also, that King Ahaz is the person
addressed in the very words which immediately
follow, &ldquo;The Lord shall bring upon
thee and upon thy people, and upon thy
father&rsquo;s house, days,&rdquo; &amp;c.</p>

<p>This transition will be the more evident
if we render the first word <i>But,</i> as the same
word is rendered just before in the same
passage: &ldquo;Is it a small thing for you to
weary men, <i>but</i> will ye weary my God also?&rdquo;
It is so rendered in this very place in our old
English Bibles, printed in 1535, 1537, 1539,
1549, 1550.</p>

<p>The word now rendered <i>&ldquo;the child,&rdquo;</i>
should be here rendered &ldquo;<span class="smcap">this</span> <i>child;</i>&rdquo; and
the sense of the verse may be then clearly
ascertained.</p>

<p>The necessity for this last rendering has
been observed by more than one expositor,
but perhaps no one has quoted any parallel instance,
or produced proper authority for this
necessary change of our translation. But, that
we may not be charged with offering violence
to an expression, in order to defend the Evangelists
or to confute their adversaries, some
authority should be produced in a point on
which so much depends, and I shall mention
several passages similar to the case now before
us.</p>

<p>When Jacob blessed Joseph&rsquo;s two sons, he
laid his hands upon their heads, and used the
very same word in the plural number which
Isaiah here uses in the singular; and as that
word is rendered &ldquo;<i>these</i> children&rdquo; by the
authors of the Greek and other very ancient
versions, we have their joint authorities for
rendering the word here &ldquo;<i>this</i> child.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The authors of our own translation have
not indeed rendered the word in the text
&ldquo;<i>this</i> child,&rdquo; but they have shown that it <i>may</i>
be so rendered, because they have themselves,
in several other places, expressed the emphatic
article by <i>this</i> and <i>that</i> in the singular number,
and by <i>these</i> in the plural. Thus in Jeremiah
xxiii.&nbsp;21, &ldquo;I have not sent <i>these</i> prophets;&rdquo; in
Numbers xi.&nbsp;6, &ldquo;There is nothing before our
eyes, but <i>this</i> manna;&rdquo; in 1&nbsp;Samuel xxix.&nbsp;4,
&ldquo;Make <i>this</i> fellow to return;&rdquo; and, to omit
other instances, we read in Jeremiah xxviii.&nbsp;16
(what it is impossible to translate otherwise),
&ldquo;<i>This</i> year thou shalt die.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But besides these instances, in which similar
words <i>may</i> and <i>must</i> be so rendered, agreeably
to our present translation, in this same verse
of Isaiah there is the authority of our old
English translation for both the alterations
here proposed; for the very first printed edition,
and at least two others, render these
words, &ldquo;<i>But</i> or ever <i>that</i> child,&rdquo; &amp;c. And, to
obviate any prejudice against the other alteration
before proposed, it should be observed that
so far from their being now first thought of to
favour any new opinions, almost all of them
are the very readings in our former English
Bibles, from which our present has varied in
this and other instances very improperly.</p>

<p>The translation of the principal word here
by <i>this child</i> being thus vindicated, it may
perhaps be asked who this child was, and the
answer is, A son of Isaiah, called <i>Shear-jashub,</i>
whom God had commanded the prophet to
take with him upon this occasion, but of whom
no use was made, unless in the application of
these words;&mdash;whom Isaiah might now hold
in his arm, and to whom therefore he might
point with his hand when he addressed himself
to Ahaz, and said, &ldquo;But before <i>this</i> child
shall grow up to discern good from evil, the
land that thou abhorrest shall be forsaken of
both her kings.&rdquo; There is an absolute necessity
of attending to this action in several
other sacred passages, as in John ii.&nbsp;18, 19.
&ldquo;What sign showest Thou?&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Destroy this
temple;&rdquo; our Lord there pointing to His own
body.</p>

<p>The child&rsquo;s name is evidently prophetical, for
it signifies, <i>a remnant,</i> or the remainder, <i>shall
return.</i> And probably he was so called because
born the year before, when such multitudes
were carried captives into the land of
Israel; and this by way of prediction to the
Jews that, though they had lost 100,000 men
by the sword in one day, and double that
number by captivity, yet those who remained
alive&mdash;the <i>remnant</i>&mdash;certainly should return
to their own country.</p>

<p>This prophecy was soon after fulfilled. And
therefore, this son, whose name had been so
consolatory the year before, was with the
utmost propriety brought forth now, and made
the subject of a second prophecy&mdash;namely,
that before <i>that</i> child, then in the second year
of his age, should be able to distinguish natural
good from evil&mdash;before he should be about
four or five years old&mdash;the lands of Syria and
Israel, spoken of here as one kingdom, on
account of their present union and confederacy,
should be &ldquo;forsaken of both her kings:&rdquo;
which, though at the time highly improbably,
came to pass about two years afterwards, when
those two kings, who had in vain attempted
to conquer Jerusalem, were themselves destroyed,
each in his own country.</p>

<hr />

<p>&ldquo;If the miraculous birth of Christ were
true, yet how could an event so very distant
be properly a <i>sign,</i> at the time when the prophecy
was delivered?&rdquo;</p>

<p>To this natural and important question, Dr.
Kennicott answers:&mdash;</p>

<p>The original word for a <i>sign</i> means also a
<i>miracle.</i> And as God had offered <i>Ahaz</i> a
miracle to be <i>then</i> performed, which had been
refused, God Himself promises to <i>the house of
David</i> a miracle which should be performed,
not then, but <i>afterwards.</i> But the word signifies,
not only something done at present, to
induce a belief of something future, but also
something to be done afterwards, declared
beforehand in confirmation of something foretold.</p>

<p>Thus, when God commanded Moses to go
from the wilderness into Egypt to demand
the dismission of his brethren, God assures
<span class="pagenum" id="p165">[p.&nbsp;165]</span>
him of success, and tells him: &ldquo;This shall be
<i>a sign</i> unto thee; when thou hast brought
forth the people, ye shall serve God upon this
mountain.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And thus, when the Assyrians were marching
against Jerusalem in the days of Hezekiah,
Isaiah is again commanded to declare that the
city shall not be taken; and after saying, &ldquo;This
shall be <i>a sign</i> unto you,&rdquo; he specifies several
particulars which were all
<span class="wsnw">future.<a id="o131_fna1" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#o131_fn1">[1]</a></span></p>

<p>If then a thing, at all future, may be declared
as <i>a sign,</i> it makes no difference whether
the thing be future by three years or three
hundred, provided that one circumstance be
observed&mdash;which is, that the man, or body of
men, to whom the fact is declared to be a sign
shall exist to see the thing accomplished.
This was manifestly the case here. For not
only Ahaz, to whom the second prophecy was
delivered, saw that fulfilled as to the two kings
his enemies, but also the house of David, to
whom the first prophecy as addressed, saw
<i>that</i> fulfilled in <span class="smcap">Jesus Christ.</span></p>

Compare also our Lord&rsquo;s treatment of the
demand for a sign, Matt. xii.&nbsp;38&ndash;40. In this
case also, to unbelievers, was given a &ldquo;sign&rdquo;
which they could not possibly have understood
when it was given.</p></div>

<h3 class="tdc" id="o132"><span class="smcap">Immanuel.</span></h3>

<p class="bq">vii.&nbsp;14. <i>And shall call His name Immanuel.</i></p>

<p>His being &ldquo;called so,&rdquo; according to
the usual dialect of the Hebrew, does
not signify so much that this should
be His usual name, as that this should
be His real character.</p>

<p><b>I. Explain the meaning of this great
and extraordinary title,</b> <span class="smcap">Immanuel</span>
(<i>cf.</i> viii.&nbsp;8 and Matt. i.&nbsp;23). This
title may be considered under a
double reference, either, 1.&nbsp;To the
constitution of His person; or, 2.&nbsp;To
His office and actings as mediator.
1.&nbsp;It is one of the great mysteries of
the Christian revelation that &ldquo;God
was manifest in the flesh.&rdquo; The eternal
Son of God became man, and was
both God and man in His own person.
In a matter of pure revelation, and of
so sublime a nature, it is certainly the
wisest and safest course to keep close
to the revelation, and make it the
standard and measure of all our conceptions
about it. 2.&nbsp;As mediator,
He is <i>Immanuel</i> in this sense, that in
Him the presence and favour of God
with His people are most eminent and
conspicuous. This has always been
true. (1.)&nbsp;As a distant friend is said
to be &ldquo;with us&rdquo; whose heart and
thoughts are with us (1&nbsp;Cor. v.&nbsp;3), so
Christ was <i>Immanuel</i> from all eternity
as to His purpose and design of mercy,
and as His heart was towards us with
thoughts of pleasure (Prov. xxix.&nbsp;30).
(2.)&nbsp;All the appearances of God to His
people under the Old Dispensation
were appearances of Christ (John i.&nbsp;18,
v.&nbsp;37; 2&nbsp;Cor. iv.&nbsp;6). 3.&nbsp;As He
took our nature and became man.
This is the essential and highest meaning
of our text. He took upon Him
<i>our</i> nature, with all its parts and
powers, all its natural affections and
infirmities, sin only excepted. 4.&nbsp;As
He conversed with men, and revealed
the will of God to them. 5.&nbsp;As He
offered Himself a sacrifice for sin, and
reconciled God and man together.
This is mentioned by the Evangelist in
the same context (Matt. i.&nbsp;21). This
was the great end of His taking our
nature, and coming into the world
(Heb. v.&nbsp;9). 6.&nbsp;As He gives His
Spirit to every true believer, and is
powerfully present with them to the
end of the world. He is present in
them, on the principle of Divine life
in their souls (John xiv.&nbsp;16; Ephes.
iii.&nbsp;17). He is present with them
whensoever they assemble to hear His
Word or observe His ordinances (Matt.
xviii.&nbsp;20; John xx.&nbsp;19). He is always
present with His Church to preserve
and succour it. 7.&nbsp;As He will be the
visible Judge of the world at last; He
will be the Judge in our nature who was
Saviour of our nature (John v.&nbsp;22;
Acts xvii.&nbsp;13). 8.&nbsp;He will be the
glorious and triumphant Head of the
redeemed world for ever. Their happiness
will lie very much in being with
Him and beholding His glory; and
their employment in adoring love and
triumphant grace.</p>

<p><b>II. Consider why this declaration</b>
<span class="pagenum" id="p166">[p.&nbsp;166]</span>
<b>fills the hearts of God&rsquo;s people with
joy.</b> 1.&nbsp;God is here presented to us
as we need Him. God absolutely considered
is an awful name; the Divine
majesty is bright and glorious, apt to
strike an awe upon our minds, to
awaken a sense of guilt, and keep us
at a distance from Him (Gen. iii.&nbsp;10;
Deut. xxvii.&nbsp;58; Job xiii.&nbsp;21). But
now He is <i>God with us,</i> God in our
nature, conversing with sinful men,
and concerned for their good; this
abates the natural dread of our minds,
and is a ground of holy freedom
towards Him (Eph. ii.&nbsp;18; iii.&nbsp;12).
2.&nbsp;The union in Christ of all Divine
and human perfections&mdash;(1)&nbsp;Is the
reason of our worship and adoration
of Him; (2)&nbsp;Is the proper ground of
confidence and trust in Him. We
may safely depend upon Him for the
accomplishment of His promises and
the salvation of our souls, for He is an
all-sufficient Saviour. 3.&nbsp;By this great
doctrine the solemnity of our future
life is relieved. The consideration of
Immanuel, or God, in our nature, has
been found by pious and devout persons
a great relief to their thoughts
of the final blessedness; we can conceive
with greater ease, and with a more
sensible pleasure, of being with Christ
than of being with the absolute Deity.</p>

<p><b>III. Consider some of the duties
which arise out of this wonderful and
glorious fact.</b> 1.&nbsp;Let us adore the
amazing condescension of our blessed
Redeemer, who stooped from heaven
to earth, consented to become a man,
and submitted to die a sacrifice (Phil. ii.&nbsp;7, 8).
2.&nbsp;Let us maintain constantly
and boldly before all men the
doctrine of His deity. If He were
only a man, or only a creature, of how
a rank soever and however dignified,
He could not be <i>God with us;</i> He
could not restore the fallen world, or
obtain by His sacrifice the pardon of
sin, or give eternal life. 3.&nbsp;Be always
ready to approach Him. Wait upon
Him in all the ways of acceptable
worship, for the manifestation of His
favour and communication of His
grace, for further discoveries of His
will, and fresh supplies of His Spirit.
Particularly attend upon Him at His
<i>table;</i> here He is with us in a more
familiar and sensible manner in the
brightest displays of His mercy and
the largest communications of His
grace. 4.&nbsp;Regard His presence with
you in all your use of the means of
grace. &rsquo;Tis reckoned a rude affront
among men, and a token of great disrespect,
to take no notice of a great
personage or overlook a superior. Regard
His presence with you as a mark
of condescending favour, and as the
life and soul of all the ordinances you
attend upon. This will hallow your
thoughts in the use of them, and make
them to you &ldquo;means of grace&rdquo; indeed.&mdash;<i>W. Harris:
Practical Discourses on
the Principal Representations of the Messiah
throughout the Old Testament,</i> pp.
275&ndash;304.</p>

<h3 class="tdc" id="o133"><span class="smcap">The Great Object of Child-Training.</span></h3>

<p class="tdc">(<i>A Sunday-School Anniversary Sermon.</i>)</p>

<p class="bq">vii.&nbsp;16. <i>The child shall know to refuse the evil, and choose the good.</i></p>

<p>These words, taken above, form a
complete sentence; yet they occur in
the clause of a sentence which is intended
to denote a space of time.
Before the child which Isaiah held in
his <span class="wsnw">arms<a id="o133_fna1" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#o133_fn1">[1]</a></span>
should know the difference
between right and wrong certain
events would take place: in other
words, before a space of four or five
years at the most would elapse, certain
things would occur. But it is not our
intention to discuss the prophecy itself;
we shall find it more in harmony
with the present occasion, and
perhaps more profitable, to consider
what may be suggested to us by these
words thus taken apart from their
context.</p>

<p><i>&ldquo;The child shall know to refuse the
evil, and choose the good.&rdquo;</i> There is
<span class="pagenum" id="p167">[p.&nbsp;167]</span>
nothing else so important for any child
to know as this (H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I. 1751). Seldom
made the object of education;
consequently the majority of lives are
failures. No child knows this without
training: the child&rsquo;s natural tendencies
are precisely the reverse of this.
But, if this training is urgently needed,
how immense and difficult is the task
of those who undertake to give it!
How difficult it often is to discern
between what is good and what is
evil&mdash;in all the realms of thought and
activity; especially in the moral realm.
The difficulty of the text is not to
cause us to decline it. We have wonderful
helps in it. 1.&nbsp;<span class="smcap">God&rsquo;s Word.</span>
What a wonderful help that is! What
a proof that in the Bible we have
God&rsquo;s Word is this, that for helpfulness
in this task no other book can be
compared with it (H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I., 506, 508,
509). Our text reminds us of what
should be our object in the Scriptural
teaching we give our children. What
value is there in any so-called Scriptural
instruction that does not tend
to cultivate spiritual discernment&mdash;hate
of what is evil, and love of what
is good? 2.&nbsp;<span class="smcap">The example of Christ,</span>
&ldquo;the law drawn out in living characters.&rdquo;
Let us not overlook or neglect
to use this marvellous instrumentality
and help. 3.&nbsp;<span class="smcap">The Holy Spirit.</span>
Always ready to co-operate with us.
Christian parents, let the remembrance
of these helps encourage you
to resume this supremely important
task with fresh vigour. Keep it ever
in view, aim at the whole of it. The
training which consists merely in
fighting against evil is foredoomed to
fail. The child must be taught, not
merely to refuse the evil, but to
choose the good. Do not be content
in the field of your child&rsquo;s heart merely
to plough up the weeds; so there
the corn which, when it is full grown,
shall overshadow and kill the weeds
which, in spite of all your efforts, will
struggle for a place there. In those
who undertake to give this training,
there is imperative need of seriousness,
humility, hopefulness, and a wise comprehensiveness.
Consider what will
be the result of success in child-training
such as this. 1.&nbsp;Our children will
be spared from indescribable misery. 2.&nbsp;They
will grow continually in all that
is noble and love-worthy. 3.&nbsp;Learning
to choose what is good, they will
necessarily choose God as He has been
thus revealed to us in Jesus Christ.
4.&nbsp;Beholding them thus allied in heart
and will to the supreme source of all
goodness, and daily becoming more like
Him, we shall feel that all our labours
and sacrifices for them are overpaid.</p>

<p>This singular record reminds us,
<b>I.&nbsp;How marvellously varied are the
means which God employs to bring
men to a knowledge and belief of
saving truth.</b> That which God&rsquo;s ancient
people needed to save them from
their mistakes and miseries was real
faith in the elementary truth that God
is the only safe counsellor, for this
simple reason, that He alone sees the
end from the beginning. All their
circumstances, interpreted by merely
human wisdom, seemed to point to
the desirableness of an alliance with
Assyria, the very thing which God by
His prophets emphatically forbade.
That it might be easier for them to
believe what seemed so incredible,
namely, that the Assyrian alliance
would be a calamity and not a blessing
to them, God gave, in addition to the
testimonies of His prophets to this
effect, a prophecy of an event seemingly
as incredible, namely, that the great
power of the two nations, Israel and
Syria, from which they had suffered so
much, and which seemed so likely to
be permanent, and on account of which
they sought Assyrian help, should be
utterly broken, and that speedily. God
predicted this in words (chap. vii.&nbsp;4&ndash;9),
and He condescended to a symbolic
act that He might impress this truth
more vividly on their minds. It is of
that symbolic act that we have the
record here. Now that God took so
much trouble for such a purpose is a
fact worth thinking about. As a matter
of fact, it is but one instance of His
constant method of dealing with men.
He is so bent on bringing them to a
knowledge and belief of truth that to
them would be saving, that He shrinks
from no trouble at all likely to secure
this result (Jer. vii.&nbsp;13, 25; Heb. i.&nbsp;1;
Luke xx.&nbsp;10&ndash;13). Illustrate, <i>e.g.,</i> how
various are the methods by which He
endeavours to awaken a careless soul
to anxiety, and to effect its conversion!
What is the explanation of this versatility
and ingenuity of methods in dealing
with us? It is the tenderness of
His love for us; it is His yearning solicitude
for our welfare.</p>

<p><b>II. How mercifully clear are the
warnings by which God seeks to turn
men from ruinous courses.</b> The
<span class="wsnw">tablet<a id="o135_fna2" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#o135_fn2">[2]</a></span>
on which Isaiah was to write
was to be large, and he was to write
upon it &ldquo;with a man&rsquo;s pen,&rdquo; an obscure
expression, but yet at least meaning
this, that the writing upon it was to
be easily legible (Hab. ii.&nbsp;2). It is
true that though the words on the
tablet were easily legible, their meaning
was obscure. But that very obscurity
was of a kind to excite inquiry (Dan.
v.&nbsp;5&ndash;7), and that inquiry earnestly and
honestly conducted would have led
God&rsquo;s ancient people to a saving knowledge
of truth. Thus it is with all the
warnings contained in God&rsquo;s Word
(H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I. 602&ndash;606).</p>

<p><b>III. How important it is that God&rsquo;s
servants should be prudent as well as
zealous.</b> After the prophecy was fulfilled,
unbelief might have questioned
whether it had ever been given, and
therefore Isaiah, acting under Divine
direction, selected two witnesses whose
testimony could not be <span class="wsnw">gainsaid.<a id="o135_fna3" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#o135_fn3">[3]</a></span>
Probably that which they were required
to testify was, that the prophecy, <i>and
its interpretation,</i> was delivered to them
on a certain day; the interpretation
embracing both the facts, that to the
prophet another son was to be born,
and that while still in his infancy the
two nations of which Judah stood in
dread should themselves be conquered.
Isaiah was thus acting on the general
principle given by our Lord for the
guidance of His people (Matt. x.&nbsp;16).
Now, as then, His prophets, while
loyally obedient to His directions,
should maintain a constant wariness
and prudence, in order that the testimony
they bear for Him should be
placed beyond cavil and dispute.</p>

<p><b>IV. How certain of accomplishment
are the prophecies involved in God-given
names.</b> The prophecy contained

In the first chapter of Hosea occurs a
like instance of symbolic names given by a
prophet to his children, and in Habakkuk ii.&nbsp;2,
we have mention of the practice of writing
a prophecy on a tablet in easily legible characters,
and hanging it up in the Temple, market-place,
or other public resort. And most modern
commentators prefer to think that Isaiah now
merely inscribed &ldquo;<span class="smcap">haste plunder, speed
spoil,</span>&rdquo; in large letters on a metal or waxed
tablet, the <span lang="hbo-Hebr" dir="rtl">&#1500;&#1460;</span> which the Authorised Version
translates &ldquo;concerning,&rdquo; being the <i>Lamed</i>
inscription is, in Jerem. xlix.&nbsp;1, 7, 23, 28;
Ezek. xxxvii.&nbsp;16; though it may be observed
that the direction to &ldquo;tie up and seal the testimony,&rdquo;
in ver. 16, is in favour of the older
version, which understands him to have made
a record of his expectation of the birth of the
child, and of the significance of that birth, at
some length. He wrote &ldquo;with a man&rsquo;s pen,&rdquo;
or &ldquo;style,&rdquo;&mdash;a phrase not unlike our &ldquo;common
hand&rdquo; or &ldquo;popular style;&rdquo; and he took as
credible witnesses that the record had preceded
the event, Uriah the high priest at the time
(2&nbsp;Kings xvi.&nbsp;10), and Zechariah, who was not
improbably the father-in-law of Ahaz and a
Levite (2&nbsp;Kings xxviii.&nbsp;2; 2&nbsp;Chron. xxix.&nbsp;1,
18). He calls his wife &ldquo;the prophetess,&rdquo; as
the wife of a king is called a queen (says
Vitringa), though she does not reign, and in
some old ecclesiastical canons the wife of a
bishop &ldquo;episcopa,&rdquo; and of a presbyter &ldquo;presbytera;&rdquo;
and he thus claims for her a place
with her husband and children (see ver. 18) in
the holy and symbolic family, who are for &ldquo;a
sign in Israel.&rdquo; She gave birth to a child,
and his name was called, in accordance with
the writing, &ldquo;Haste-plunder, Speed-spoil,&rdquo; that
the people might understand that before he
was old enough to utter the words &ldquo;father&rdquo;
and &ldquo;mother,&rdquo;&mdash;that is, within a short but
somewhat indefinite period such as we should
express by &ldquo;in a year or two from his birth,&rdquo;&mdash;the
spoils of the plundered cities of Samaria
and Damascus, the capitals of the nations now
invading Judah, shall have been carried before
the Assyrian conqueror in triumph.</p>

<p>In order to realise the practical impressiveness
of such symbolic acts and names upon
Isaiah&rsquo;s contemporaries, we must remember
that Jerusalem was a very small town for size
and population compared with the notion we
insensibly get of a capital from our own vast
London; and also that there was as little in
the ways of thinking and living of that age
and country as in the extent of the city to
effect such a separation between a public man&rsquo;s
political and private life as exists in England.
We respect the domestic reserve of our neighbours,
and we fortify ourselves in the like reserve,
by our habit of learning what they are
doing that concerns us through the newspaper
which we read by our own fireside. With no
newspapers, and a climate which encouraged
an out-of-door life, the people of Jerusalem
would become as familiar with that personal
demeanour of Isaiah in the market-place or
elsewhere which he made a part of his public
ministry, as we are with the mental habits and
political conduct of Mr. Gladstone or Mr.
Disraeli, though the greater part of us would
recognise neither of them by sight, and still
fewer know anything of their personal and
private life.&mdash;<i>Strachey.</i></p></div>

<i>A great roll.</i> Rather, <i>a large tablet:</i> of
wood or metal, covered with a smooth surface
of wax; which, when written upon, was hung

<i>Faithful witnesses.</i> Or, <i>sure</i> witnesses;
whose testimony none would be able to gainsay:
partly, because of their rank, but still
more, it would seem, from their being adherents
of Ahaz. For &ldquo;Uriah the priest&rdquo;
can scarcely be any other than the one who
made the Syrian altar after the description
sent him from Damascus by Ahaz (2&nbsp;Kings
xvi.&nbsp;10&ndash;16); thereby (as Mr. Birks notices)
furnishing incontrovertible evidence of the
fulfilment of Isaiah&rsquo;s prediction. Zechariah
may have been Ahaz&rsquo;s own father-in-law (2&nbsp;Chron.
xxix.&nbsp;1).&mdash;<i>Kay.</i></p></div>

Isaiah&rsquo;s interview with Ahaz (chap. vii.),
the preparation of the tablet, the birth of
Isaiah&rsquo;s child, and the conquest of Syria and
Israel by the Assyrians under Tiglath-pileser
all took place within the year 743&ndash;739 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span></p>

<p><i>Alexander</i> remarks on ver. 4:&mdash;&ldquo;Samaria
is here put for the kingdom, and not for the
capital city. But even if the name be strictly
understood, there is no reason to doubt that
Samaria was plundered by Tiglath-pileser (2&nbsp;Kings
xv.&nbsp;29), although not destroyed.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
The carrying away of its wealth does not
necessarily imply anything more than such a
spoiling of the capital as might be expected in
the course of a brief but successful invasion.&rdquo;</p></div>

<p>For &ldquo;rejoice <i>in</i> Rezin and Remaliah&rsquo;s

disaster which had befallen the allied
powers who had inflicted such disasters
upon Judah, and had threatened it
with utter destruction.</p>

<p>We have here a prophecy given in
symbols. One of them is explained
by the prophet himself. He explains
that by &ldquo;the river&rdquo; he means the
King of Assyria. Commentators are
generally of opinion that by &ldquo;the
waters of Shiloah&rdquo; is meant the
Davidic dynasty, which God, on certain
conditions, had pledged Himself
to maintain. But this put them to
hard shifts to explain the rejoicing of
the people. It is better to regard
&ldquo;the waters of Shiloah&rdquo; as symbolical
of the help which God offered His
people. The contrast then becomes
intelligible. Because that help was
unseen&mdash;apprehensible only by faith&mdash;it
seemed to the multitudes, when
compared with that which the King
of Assyria was visibly rendering them,
in the overthrow of Syria and Israel,
to be as little worthy of consideration
as is the little stream of
<span class="wsnw">Shiloah<a id="o136_fna1" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#o136_fn1">[1]</a></span> in
comparison with that mighty river,
the <span class="wsnw">Euphrates.<a id="o136_fna2" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#o136_fn2">[2]</a></span>
We have, then, here <i>the case of men who are rejoicing in
a success that is godless,</i> that has been
obtained by the rejection of God;
and we are here told what the end of
that success must be. Thus we find a
theme that bears upon our life to-day.</p>

<p>1. Whatever be our life-work, there
are two ways of seeking success in it&mdash;with
God, or without God. 2.&nbsp;If
we take God to be our ally, we must
do our work on <i>His</i> terms and plans.
But these are frequently contrary to
our natural expectations, and opposed
to what the world calls &ldquo;common
sense.&rdquo; As helps to a speedy and
great success, they seem to most men
as despicable as the little stream of
Shiloah in comparison with the broad
river Euphrates. 3.&nbsp;Consequently the
vast majority of men reject them, and
seek for success without God, and
contrary to His methods (H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I. 4198).
4.&nbsp;In this way, they frequently speedily
attain to a success which appears to be
a complete justification of the wisdom
of their policy. When the prophecy
contained in our text was uttered, the
forces of Syria and Israel were being
swept away by the triumphant Assyrian
host, and no doubt Ahaz and His
court felt they could afford to laugh at
Isaiah, who had steadily opposed the
alliance which appeared to have been
so advantageous. 5.&nbsp;But the triumph
of the wicked is short. The unholy
success in which bad men rejoice contains
within itself the seeds of peril
and pain, of retribution, and ruin
(H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I. 4609, 4612). The ally in
whom Ahaz had trusted presently
became his oppressor; it was a verification
in actual life of the fable of the
horse that took a man for its ally. So
it is to-day with all who prosper without
God and against God. Their prosperity
is, strictly speaking, unnatural,
and everything that is unnatural
speedily brings on disorder. For
example, a family has been enriched
by godless plans; to those who have
no fear of God in their hearts, there is
nothing so perilous as wealth; it is
used for the gratification of the baser
passions; by this gratification health
is broken down; when the physical
frame is shattered, conscience, that has
been suppressed, breaks forth into
freedom and activity, and remorse
turns the gilded palace into a hell.
The illustrations of the working of
this great law are endless.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Practical Applications.</span>&mdash;1.&nbsp;In
the conduct of daily life, as well as in
our spiritual concerns, let us walk by
faith, not by sight. God&rsquo;s help,
though it may seem inconsiderable as
Shiloah&rsquo;s stream, is yet, like that
stream, constant. Our reliance upon
it will never issue in disappointment.
By means of it we shall certainly
<span class="pagenum" id="p171">[p.&nbsp;171]</span>
attain to all the prosperity that would
be for our real welfare (H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I. 3984&ndash;3986,
5059, 5060). 2.&nbsp;Let us not
envy the prosperity of the wicked
(H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I. 4943&ndash;4948, 4961&ndash;4966). It
is short-lived, like the mighty flood of
Euphrates itself. Out of that very
prosperity heart-aches innumerable will
spring. The rejoicing that is so exultant
and scornful to-day, to-morrow
will be turned into lamentation and
woe. Then those who triumphed
without God will find that in defeat
they are without Him: this will be
their description, &ldquo;Without God, and
without hope in the world.&rdquo; 3.&nbsp;When
Jesus of Nazareth was called to choose
between the stream and the river, His
decision was prompt and unhesitating
(Matt. iv.&nbsp;8&ndash;10). Up to the very end
of His life His choice seemed to have
been a foolish one (Matt. viii.&nbsp;20); on
Calvary it seemed to have been madness:
but all history since has been a vindication
of its wisdom (Phil. ii.&nbsp;9, 10).</p>

All accounts combined in asserting that
the waters of the two pools of Siloam, as well
as that of the many fountains of the &ldquo;Mosque
of Omar,&rdquo; proceed from a spring or reservoir
of water beneath the Temple vaults. There
was no period of its history when such a provision
would not have been important to the
Temple for the ablutions of the Jewish, no
less than of the Mussulman, worship; or to
the city, which else was dry even to a proverb.
It was the treasure of Jerusalem, its support
through all its numerous sieges, the <span lang="la">&ldquo;fons
perennis aqu&aelig;&rdquo;</span> of Tacitus, the source of
Milton&rsquo;s</p>

<p class="bqpoemr">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Brook that flowed<br />
Hard by the oracle of God.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But, more than this, it was the image which
entered into the very heart of the prophetical
idea of Jerusalem (Ps. xlvi.&nbsp;4, lxxxvii.&nbsp;7;
Isa. xii.&nbsp;3). It is the source of all the
freshness and verdure of the vale of Hinnom.
In Ezekiel&rsquo;s vision the thought is expanded
into a vast cataract flowing out through the
Temple rock eastward and westward into the
ravines of Hinnom and Kedron, till they swell
into a mighty river, fertilising the desert of
the Dead Sea. And with still greater distinctness
the thought appears again, and for
the last time, in the discourse, when in the
courts of the Temple, &ldquo;in the last day, that
great day of the feast&rdquo; [of Tabernacles], &ldquo;Jesus
stood and cried, saying, If any man thirst, let
him come unto Me.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. out of his belly
shall flow rivers of living water.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Stanley.</i></p>

<p>The expression in Isaiah, &ldquo;waters of
Shiloah that go softly,&rdquo; seems to point to the
slender rivulet, flowing gently, though once
very profusely, out of Siloam into the lower
breadth of level, where the king&rsquo;s gardens, or
&ldquo;royal paradise,&rdquo; stood, and which is still the
greenest spot about the Holy City, reclaimed
from sterility into a fair oasis of olive groves,
fig-trees, pomegranates, &amp;c., by the tiny rill
that flows out of Siloam. A winter-torrent,
like the Kedron, or a swelling river like the
Euphrates, carries havoc with it by sweeping
off soil, trees, and terraces; but this Siloam-fed
rill flows softly, fertilising and beautifying
the region through which it passes.&mdash;<i>Bonar.</i></p></div>

The Euphrates, <i>i.e.,</i> the good and
abounding river. The Euphrates is the largest,
the longest, and by far the most important of
the rivers of Western Asia. It rises from two
chief sources in the Armenian mountains&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
they meet at <i>Kebben-Maten,</i> nearly in
the long. 39&deg; E. from Greenwich, having run
respectively 400 and 270 miles. Here the
stream formed by their combined waters is
120 yards wide, rapid and very deep.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
The entire course is calculated at 1760 miles,
nearly 650 more than that of the Tigris, and
only 200 short of that of the Indus; and of
this distance more than two-thirds (1200
miles) is navigable for boats, and even, as the
expedition of Colonel Chesney proved, for
small steamers. The width of the river is
greatest at the distance of 700 or 800 miles
from its mouth, that is to say, from its junction
with the <i>Khabour</i> to the village of Werai.
It there averages 400 yards.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The annual
inundation of the Euphrates is caused by the
melting of the snows in the Armenian highlands.
It occurs in the month of May.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
The Tigris scarcely ever overflows, but the
Euphrates inundates large tracts on both sides of
its course from H&icirc;t downwards.&mdash;<i>Rawlinson.</i></p>

<p>Considered in a commercial respect, as well
as with regard to its uses in agriculture, the
Euphrates manifestly stood in the same relation
to Babylon and the surrounding region
that the Nile did to Egypt; it was the source,
to a large extent, of its prosperity, and the
most important element of its greatness. It
is in this relation that the <i>symbolical</i> use of
the Euphrates in Scripture proceeds, and by
keeping it in view the several passages will be
found to admit to an easy explanation. Contributing
so materially to the resources and
wealth of Babylon, the river was naturally
taken for an emblem or representative of the
city itself, and of the empire of which it was
the capital. In this respect a striking application
is made of it by the prophet Isaiah (chap.
viii.&nbsp;5&ndash;8), where the little kingdom of Judah,
with its circumscribed territory and its few
earthly resources, on the one hand is seen
imaged in the tiny brooklet of Shiloah; while,
on the other, the rising power of Babylon is
spoken of under the emblem of &ldquo;the waters
of the river, strong and many, even the King
of Assyria and all his glory.&rdquo; And he goes
<span class="pagenum" id="p172">[p.&nbsp;172]</span>
on to expose the folly of Israel&rsquo;s [Judah&rsquo;s]
trusting in this foreign power on account of
its material greatness, by declaring that in
consequence of this mistaken trust, and in
chastisement of it, the mighty stream would,
as it were, desert its proper channel, and turn
its waters in a sweeping and desolating flood
over the Holy Land.&mdash;<i>Fairbairn.</i></p></div>

<p>This is a shout of triumphant defiance
which Ahaz and his people
might have raised, had they listened
to Isaiah&rsquo;s counsels, and turned to the
Lord with full purpose of heart. Then
they might have been threatened by
foes numerous, powerful, determined,
and confederated, but they would have
been safe. Its doctrine clearly is, that
it matters not who may be against us,
if God be with us. This has been the
faith of God&rsquo;s people in all generations.</p>

<p><b>I. On what ground does it rest?</b>
1.&nbsp;On what may be regarded as a
settled conviction of the human mind,
that this world, disordered as it is, is
really governed by a righteous Ruler,
omnipotent and all-wise, and that it
must be well with those who have
Him on their side. 2.&nbsp;On the declarations
of God&rsquo;s Word (Gen. xv.&nbsp;1; Ps.
xxxiv.&nbsp;7; Isa. liv.&nbsp;17, &amp;c.) 3.&nbsp;On the
experience of His people as recorded
in His Word. The promise to Abraham
was kept; David (1&nbsp;Sam. xvii.&nbsp;37);
Hezekiah (2&nbsp;Kings xix.&nbsp;32&ndash;35); Daniel
and his companions (Dan. vi.&nbsp;22, iii.&nbsp;28);
Peter (Acts xii.&nbsp;7). On these
accounts His people have felt and
expressed the utmost contempt for,
and defiance of, their foes (Ps. xxvii.&nbsp;1&ndash;6;
Micah vii.&nbsp;8&ndash;10). Old as these
utterances are, they express the confidence
of countless thousands to-day.
But, <b>II.</b>&nbsp;Let us look at <b>the grounds
that might cause us to hesitate to
receive it.</b> 1.&nbsp;There is the undoubted
fact that we are living in a world in
which many things happen that are
contrary to what we would have expected;
and it would be only one
more contradiction of our <span lang="la">&agrave; priori</span> expectations
if a good man, or a number
of good men, were utterly destroyed by
a number of bad men. 2.&nbsp;As a matter
of fact, this has often happened. Who
were &ldquo;the noble army of martyrs,&rdquo;
but good men who suffered intolerable
wrongs, and were put to cruel deaths?
If Peter was delivered, James, his
fellow-apostle, was left to his fate
(Acts xii.&nbsp;2); yea, Peter himself at
last died by the hands of the executioner,
as did nearly all the Apostles.
See, what a terrible record of the
sufferings of righteous men we have in
Heb. xi.&nbsp;35&ndash;37. <b>III.&nbsp;How are these
two sets of facts to be harmonised?</b>
How account for it that, notwithstanding
the latter set, which are obvious
and not denied, it is still the settled
conviction of pious and otherwise sensible
<span class="pagenum" id="p173">[p.&nbsp;173]</span>
men, that it shall be well with
the righteous? 1.&nbsp;This <i>is</i> undoubtedly
true, on the whole. We see what is
the teaching of experience, taken on
any considerable scale, in the familiar
proverb, &ldquo;Honesty is the best policy.&rdquo;
Deadly as is the conflict between the
powers of good and of evil, on the
whole, the victory is on the side of
goodness, of righteousness, of truth.
The world grows better, not worse
(H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I. 1161, 1162). And it is
manifest that &ldquo;godliness has the
promise of the life that now is, as well
of that which is to come.&rdquo; 2.&nbsp;The
exceptions to which our attention is
directed are necessary. Without them
the difficulties in the way of the existence
and growth of virtue would be
immensely increased. If those who
served God ran no risk in doing so, it
would be as difficult for them to show
that they loved Him for His own
sake, as it would be for soldiers to
prove their bravery, if it were possible
to send them forth to battle in absolutely
impregnable armour. If the
safety assured to God&rsquo;s people were
absolute and without exceptions, there
would be no room for the exercise of
faith and loyalty. 3.&nbsp;This life is not
all. It is but the prelude to our real
existence; and for whatever we suffer
in God&rsquo;s cause here, we shall be abundantly
compensated hereafter. So that,
with Sir Thomas More, we may say,
&ldquo;They may take off my head, but
hurt me they cannot.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This is a plain and sober statement
of the facts of this great problem.
What are the practical inferences to
be drawn from it? 1.&nbsp;<i>Let us dismiss
from our minds all fears for the cause of
truth and righteousness. That</i> is safe
(2&nbsp;Cor. xiii.&nbsp;8). God&rsquo;s Church and
God&rsquo;s Word will survive all the assaults
that are made upon them (H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I.
642&ndash;645, 1246&ndash;1251, 2449). 2.&nbsp;<i>Let
us not be greatly concerned as to what
may happen to ourselves.</i> If God pleases,
He can deliver us from any danger
that may threaten us. If He is not
pleased to do so, He knows how to
make our sufferings promote the cause
we have at heart. &ldquo;The blood of the
martyrs is the seed of the Church&rdquo;
(P.&nbsp;D. 2421, 2422, 2426). 3.&nbsp;<i>If we
are called to suffer, let us rejoice</i> (Phil.
i.&nbsp;29; 2&nbsp;Tim. ii.&nbsp;9; P.&nbsp;D. 2419).</p>

from the grievous practical heresy of
abstention from public <span class="wsnw">life.<a id="o139_fna2" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#o139_fn2">[2]</a></span>
Civilised life, especially in a free community,
is a partnership, and no man
has a right to take all the advantages
of a partnership and evade all its
labours and obligations. &ldquo;Owe no
man anything.&rdquo; We are bound to
labour as well as pray, that God&rsquo;s will
may be done on earth as it is done in
heaven. The result of abstention on
the part of Christian men from public
life is the domination of bad men, and
the employment of the resources of the
community for evil purposes (Ps. xii.&nbsp;8).
If we need example in this matter, we
have the example of the prophets, who
were much more than preachers of a
monastic piety: they were active politicians,
and yet politicians of an utterly
unworldly type. 2.&nbsp;By these principles
they will be guided and kept aid all
the duties and difficulties of public
life. They will be uplifted above
party spirit in all its narrow and debasing
forms. Theirs will be that true
patriotism which consists in a steady
loyalty to truth, and righteousness,
and mercy.</p>

<p>If we are to be Biblical politicians,
and this is the duty of every man
among us, <b>I.&nbsp;We shall not necessarily
be found on the side of the majority</b>
(ver. 11). How often God&rsquo;s people
have been called to stand in what is
called &ldquo;a miserable minority!&rdquo; (Exod.
<span class="pagenum" id="p174">[p.&nbsp;174]</span>
xxiii.&nbsp;2). <b>II.&nbsp;We shall not necessarily
adopt as our own the popular cries</b>
(ver. <span class="wsnw">12).<a id="o139_fna3" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#o139_fn3">[3]</a></span>
<span lang="la">Vox populi</span> is often far
other than <span lang="la">Vox Dei.</span> <b>III.&nbsp;We shall
not necessarily share in the prevalent
feelings of our time,</b> whether they be
those of fear or of hope (ver. 13). We
shall know that no permanent hurt
can be done to our nation while it is
in pursuit of righteousness, and that
no real advantage can be gained by
methods that will not bear the Divine
scrutiny. <b>IV.&nbsp;Our supreme desire will
be, not to conciliate men, but to please
God</b> (ver. 13). We shall consider all
public questions, and vote for, and withhold
our vote from, all public men, as
in His sight (Heb. xi.&nbsp;27). This may
cause us often to cut ourselves off from
our &ldquo;party,&rdquo; but this will not trouble
us. Hostility may thus be excited
against us&mdash;will be excited against
us, for such &ldquo;impracticable men&rdquo; are
the abhorrence of mere politicians;
but then God Himself will be to us
&ldquo;for a <span class="wsnw">sanctuary.&rdquo;<a id="o139_fna4" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#o139_fn4">[4]</a></span>
<b>V.&nbsp;We shall never lose sight of the fact that the
penalty of ungodliness in public life is
ruin</b> (vers. 14, 15). The real Ruler of
the world is God, who governs it according
to a plan of truth, righteousness,
and mercy; and every human
&ldquo;policy&rdquo; which is not consistent therewith,
though it may win for its authors
a short-lived triumph, will inevitably
plunge those who accept it into disaster.
From those who fight against
God, utter defeat cannot be far off.</p>

<p>When these facts are inwrought in
the understandings and consciences of
God&rsquo;s people and have become influential
in their public and political life,
much will have been done to usher in
the millennium for which we daily pray,
and of which Isaiah himself has given
us such glowing pictures (chaps. ii.&nbsp;4,
xxxii.&nbsp;16, 17; lx.&nbsp;17).</p>

There was a general panic among the
people: &ldquo;their heart was moved as the trees
of the wood are moved by the wind,&rdquo; when
they heard that Syria was confederate with
Ephraim; their cry was everywhere, &ldquo;A confederacy
has been made against us, and we
must meet it by a counter-alliance with
Assyria;&rdquo; and the prophet says that he too
should have fallen under the influence of this
panic, if Jehovah had not laid hold of him
with a strong hand, to keep him in the way of
dependence on Himself, and if He had not
taught him to escape the fear which possessed
his fellow-countrymen, by making the Lord of
hosts his fear and his dread, by sanctifying
Him himself, as he now in His name calls on
them to do. To sanctify Jehovah is in mind
and practice to recognise Him as the <i>holy</i> God,
the Lord who is <i>absolute</i> (absolutus), free from
the limitations which hinder all other beings
from carrying their wills into full operation,
and to believe with the whole heart that God
does and can govern all things according to
the counsel of His own will, and that what He
determines does certainly come to pass, however
probabilities and appearances may be
against the belief (Num. xx.&nbsp;12; Deut. xxxii.&nbsp;51;
Isa. xxix.&nbsp;23). To the nation which thus
sanctifies Jehovah, He (says Isaiah) will be
their sanctuary&mdash;their protection against all
their enemies. Such was His original covenant
with both the houses of Israel, and
it still holds good. If, therefore, they will
break and renounce it, it becomes a stumbling-block
to them. When their statesmen endeavour
to remedy present mischief and secure
future prosperity, by craftily playing off against
one another the nations who they cannot
hope to match by force, they are attempting
to go counter to the whole plan of Jehovah&rsquo;s
government, and they will do it only to their
own confusion.&mdash;<i>Strachey.</i></p></div>

<span class="wsnw"><span lang="hbo-latn">kesher!</span>&rdquo;)&thinsp;; . . .</span> the reference is
to the conspiracy, as it was called, of the
prophet and his disciples. The same thing
happened to Isaiah as to Amos (Amos vii.&nbsp;10)
and to Jeremiah. Whenever the prophets were
at all zealous in their opposition to the appeal
for foreign aid, they were accused and branded
as standing in the service of the enemy, and
conspiring for the overthrow of the kingdom.&mdash;<i>Delitzsch.</i></p></div>

<span lang="hbo-Latn">Mikdash</span> generally means the sanctified
place or sanctuary, with which the idea of an
asylum would easily associate itself, since even
among the Israelites the Temple was regarded
and respected as an asylum (1&nbsp;Kings i.&nbsp;50; ii.&nbsp;28).&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
<span lang="hbo-Latn">Mikdash</span> is really to be taken in this
sense, although it cannot be exactly rendered
&ldquo;asylum,&rdquo; since this would improperly limit
the meaning of the word. The Temple was
not only a place of shelter, but also of grace,
blessing, and peace. All who sanctified the
Lord of lords He surrounded like temple walls;
hid them in Himself, whilst death and tribulation
reigned without, and comforted, fed, and
blessed them in his own gracious fellowship
(chap. iv.&nbsp;5, 6; Ps. xxvii.&nbsp;5; xxxi.&nbsp;20).&mdash;<i>Delitzsch.</i></p></div>

<h3 class="tdc" id="o141"><span class="smcap">God Our Refuge, or Our Ruin.</span></h3>

<p class="bq">viii.&nbsp;14. <i>And He shall be for a sanctuary; but for a stone of stumbling, &amp;c.</i></p>

<p>In God &ldquo;we live, and move, and
have our being.&rdquo; We cannot be independent
of, or indifferent to, Him, as
we can in regard to some of our fellow-men.
There can be no neutrality between
Him and us. We must be obedient
or disobedient to Him, and therefore
we must find in Him our refuge or
our ruin&mdash;our helper or our destroyer.
That this vast truth may be received
in our minds, let us take it somewhat
in detail.</p>

<p><b>I. We have to do with God in
Nature.</b> It is His world we live in;
and all its substances and forces are
things which He hath made, and intends
to be used according to His
plans. Nay, He acts in <span class="wsnw">them,<a id="o141_fna1" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#o141_fn1">[1]</a></span> and
in them He is willing to be our ally,
but not our slave. We cannot use
Him to carry into effect our whims
and fancies, as the old magicians were
said to use the genii supposed to be
under their control. God is of one
mind, He changeth not; what is called
&ldquo;the uniformity of the laws of nature&rdquo;
is one manifestation of His unchangeableness;
and that unchangeableness
is most merciful (H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I. 3156, 3157,
3173&ndash;3177). If we fall in with His
laws of nature, all nature is on our
side; wind and tide then combine to
bear us into our desired haven; but if
we will not do so, the very stones of
the field will be in league against us
(Job v.&nbsp;23; H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I. 3172,
<span class="wsnw">4612).<a id="o141_fna2" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#o141_fn2">[2]</a></span>
<i>E.g.,</i> gravitation. If a builder comply
with the demands of this great law,
it will give stability to his structure;
but if not, from the very moment
they are departed from, it will begin
to pull down the hut or the palace he
has builded. So with all the other
substances and forces by which we are
surrounded; they are for us or against
us: there is no neutrality possible.</p>

<p><b>II. We have to do with God in Providence.</b>
Not only are we in this
world, but whether we like or not, we
are under His government. He has
laid down laws for our guidance, as
communities and as individuals. These
laws are vast and comprehensive; they
cover every realm of activity and relationship
of life; it is impossible for
us to find ourselves in any place or
circumstances in which some of them
are not in force. If we obey them,
they will be our helpers; if we disobey
them, they will be our destroyers:
<span class="pagenum" id="p176">[p.&nbsp;176]</span>
obey one, and all others stand ready
to befriend us; disobey one, and more
manifestly all others become hostile to
us. Illustrate&mdash;1.&nbsp;<i>Communities.</i> The
law of frugality. The law of freedom
of exchange. The supreme law for
every nation is, that God shall be
acknowledged as the supreme ruler,
<i>His</i> will done, His protection sought
and trusted in. It was this law
that Ahaz and his people were setting
at defiance (chap. vii.), and
God forewarned them that He
would not stand idly by and see
it broken (chap. vii.&nbsp;17&ndash;20). If
any nation commit itself to a godless
policy, it may achieve a transient
triumph thereby (ver. 6), but disaster
is inevitable (ver. 7). It may be delayed,
but it is only that it may come
in more awful form. United States of
America: their maintenance of slavery
when England abolished it, and their
civil war. 2.&nbsp;<i>Individuals.</i> The comprehensive
law (Matt. vii.&nbsp;12): if a
man obey it, the very constitution of
society fights for him; if he disobey it,
that same constitution fights against
him. From God, as the God of Providence,
we cannot escape; we must
have to do with Him as friend or foe.
Those men who deliberately put Him
out of their thoughts and plans find it
so: just when they seem to themselves
to be triumphing in their godless
courses, they stumble against Him
unawares. They are snared and taken
in the great retributive laws of His
universe.</p>

<p><b>III. We have to do with God in Redemption.</b>
In Christ, God is revealed,
and therefore we are not to be surprised
when we see this great Old
Testament truth conspicuously illustrated
in Him. In the New Testament
we are distinctly taught that
neutrality in regard to Christ is impossible
(Matt. xii.&nbsp;30; 2&nbsp;Cor. ii.&nbsp;16;
Matt. xxii.&nbsp;37&ndash;44). Not to accept
His salvation, is to reject it; not to
submit to His authority, is to rebel
against it. We cannot choose whether
we will have to do with Christ or not!
All that we can decide is the nature of
the relationship that shall subsist between
us. We can make Him our
sanctuary, and then all blessing is
ours; or we can refuse to do this, and
then He becomes to us a stumbling-block
and a snare. Not as the result
of any vindictive action on His part,
but as the inevitable result of the
working of our own nature and of the
constitution of the universe. 1.&nbsp;The
phrase, &ldquo;Gospel-hardened,&rdquo; represents
a terrible reality (H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I. 2439&ndash;2442).
2.&nbsp;By our rejection of Christ, and consequent
rebellion against His authority,
we put ourselves on the side of those
powers of evil which He is pledged to
destroy, and then His very Almightiness,
which would have insured our
salvation, becomes our ruin, just as the
very same force of wind and wave,
which would carry a vessel rightly
steered into the desired haven, hurls
it when wrongly steered as a miserable
wreck on the rocks outside.</p>

<p>Thus, in all the realms of life, we
must have God with us or against us;
and if God be against us, we have
cause to lament that He is God&mdash;a
being whom we cannot resist, from
whom we cannot escape. Therefore,
1.&nbsp;<i>Let us recognise what the realities of
our position are.</i> Let us not go on
to eternal ruin through ignorance or
heedlessness. 2.&nbsp;<i>Let us make God our
&ldquo;sanctuary.&rdquo;</i> We may do this. He
invites us to do it. Having done it,
everything in Him that otherwise
would terrify us will be to us a cause
of joy (Rom. v.&nbsp;11).</p>

<p class="bq">viii.&nbsp;14. <i>And He shall be for&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. a stone of stumbling and for a rock of offence to
both the houses of Israel.</i></p>

<p>This prophecy refers to our Lord
Jesus Christ, and it has had a threefold
fulfilment. It was fulfilled&mdash;<b>1.&nbsp;In His
own personal history.</b> When He was
made manifest to Israel He was so
contrary to their conceptions of what
the Messiah would be&mdash;in the lowliness
of His condition, in the spirituality of
the kingdom He set up, and, above
all, in the ignominiousness of the death
He accomplished at Jerusalem,&mdash;that
they &ldquo;stumbled at&rdquo; and rejected Him.
<b>2.&nbsp;In the experience of His disciples
in all ages.</b> In them He has been
again despised and rejected. This He
foresaw and predicted (John xv.&nbsp;18&ndash;21,
&amp;c.). In the world there is an
irreconcilable hatred of Christ as He
reappears in His people (Gal. iii.&nbsp;28,
29). <b>3.&nbsp;In the hostility which faithful
preaching has always created.</b>
The preaching of the Gospel is the
preaching of Christ (Acts v.&nbsp;42; 1&nbsp;Cor.
i.&nbsp;23; 2&nbsp;Cor. iv.&nbsp;5). The great
evangelical doctrines all centre in and
flow from &ldquo;Christ and Him crucified,&rdquo;
and can never be clearly and faithfully
proclaimed without awakening the disgust
and enmity of the carnal heart.
They necessarily humble sinful men,
and they hate to be humbled. The
offence of the cross is not yet ceased;
multitudes still stumble at the truth,
being disobedient.</p>

<p>1. How sad that Christ should be
an offence and a stumbling-stone to a
single soul! That His Word, which is
sufficient for all the purposes of salvation,
should become to any &ldquo;the
savour of death unto death&rdquo;! 2.&nbsp;How
terrible, and earnestly to be shunned,
is that unbelief which thus reverses
the design of God&rsquo;s greatest mercies!
3.&nbsp;Whatever others may do, let us,
with penitent and thankful hearts,
make Christ our &ldquo;sanctuary.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Manuscript

<h3 class="tdc" id="o143"><span class="smcap">The Duty of Teachers of Truth in Times of National Perversion.</span></h3>

<p class="bq">viii.&nbsp;16&ndash;18.</p>

<p>In Heb. ii.&nbsp;13 the commencement
of verse 18 is quoted as an utterance
of the Messiah. This opens up questions
concerning the New Testament
quotations from the Old which cannot
be fully discussed in this commentary.
It may suffice to remark that the
Spirit inspiring Isaiah was the Spirit
of Christ, and that therefore Isaiah&rsquo;s
utterances generally may be regarded
as the utterances of Christ; and further,
this is especially true in those
cases in which there is a close similarity
in the position occupied by the
great prophet of the Messiah and the
Messiah Himself. At times Isaiah
appears to be merely the spokesman
of the Messiah; but in others, while
his words had their ultimate and
highest fulfilment in Christ, they were
primarily true of himself, and this appears
to be the case here.</p>

<p>There are times when a nation goes
utterly wrong, politically, socially, and,
as the root of all the evil, religiously.
God is forgotten, and the people give
themselves over to purposes of ambition
or of sensual pleasure. It is a time of
formalism and pharisaism, of infidelity
and blasphemy, of luxury and vice.
So strong is this current of evil that it
seems a hopeless and foolish thing for
any man or body of men to resist it.
What, then, is the prophet or faithful
preacher to do? Prudence counsels
compliance with the prevailing temper
(2&nbsp;Chron. xviii.&nbsp;12), or at least a temporary
silence. Shall he listen to
prudence, and bid principle wait for
a more fitting season? Nay, but&mdash;<b>I.&nbsp;Let</b>
<span class="pagenum" id="p178">[p.&nbsp;178]</span>
<b>him betake himself in prayer to
God</b> (ver. 16). Let him pray especially
that Divine truth may be kept in the
hearts of the few who have been led
to receive <span class="wsnw">it.<a id="o143_fna1" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#o143_fn1">[1]</a></span>
<b>II.&nbsp;Let him wait upon God</b> with immovable confidence
that His truth shall yet prevail in the
earth (ver. 17). Thus did the Primitive
Christians, the Puritans, and the
Covenanters in the evil days in which
they lived. <b>III.&nbsp;Let him recognise
and glory in the position he occupies</b>
(ver. 18). He and his spiritual children
are God&rsquo;s witnesses (Isa. xliv.&nbsp;8);
what position could be more honourable?
Let them not shrink from its
conspicuousness (Phil. ii.&nbsp;15); let them
not be disheartened by the singularity
it involves (H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I. 1032&ndash;1045, 3906,
3914; P.&nbsp;D. 1188). Amid all that is
depressing and threatening in the
position to which they have been
Divinely called, let them remember
their Lord&rsquo;s declarations (Matt. x.&nbsp;32;
Rev. iii.&nbsp;5).</p>

I agree with Vitringa, Dreschler, and
others in regarding verse 16 as the prophet&rsquo;s
own prayer to Jehovah. We <i>&ldquo;bind&rdquo;&mdash;tie
together</i>&mdash;what we wish to keep from getting
separated and lost; we <i>&ldquo;seal&rdquo;</i> what is to be
kept secret, and only opened by a person duly
qualified. And so the prophet here prayed
that Jehovah would take his testimony with
regard to the future, and his intimation, which
was designed to prepare for the future that
<i>testimony</i> and <span lang="hbo-Latn">thorah</span> which the greatest mass, in
their hardness, did not understand, and in
their self-hardening despised, and lay them up
well secured and well preserved, as if by bond
and seal, in the hearts of those who receive
the prophet&rsquo;s words with loving obedience.
For it would be all over with Israel unless a
community of believers should be preserved,
and all over with the community if the word
of God, which was the ground of their life,
should be allowed to slip out of their hearts.&mdash;<i>Delitzsch.</i></p></div>

or Egypt, from Tyre or Nineveh, that
He hides His face, but from &ldquo;the house
of Jacob.&rdquo; 1.&nbsp;The persons referred
to may be regarded as typical of the
Church. Though descended from Abraham,
they were called &ldquo;the house of
<i>Jacob</i>,&rdquo; to denote that they were a
<i>chosen</i> people&mdash;a <i>praying</i> people (this
at least was true of the best men
among them)&mdash;a people <i>in whom God
delighted.</i> 2.&nbsp;With these persons He
dealt in a manner contrary to what we
should have expected. Looking only
at the relation in which He stood to
them, we should have expected that
the light of His countenance would
have gladdened them continually. Yet
He hid Himself; and He frequently
hides Himself not only from the world,
but from the Church; not only from
the wicked man, but from the believer.
Yet here is a difference: in the one

<b>III.&nbsp;The resolve
of the believer under this visitation.</b>
In nothing does the grace of God shine
more unmistakably than in the way
in which the Christian bears trouble.
&ldquo;Behold, this evil is of the Lord; why
should I wait for the Lord any longer?&rdquo;
said a wicked man of old; but &ldquo;I will
look unto the Lord, and will wait for
Him,&rdquo; is the prophet&rsquo;s resolve. 1.&nbsp;As
to <i>looking</i> for Him. (1.)&nbsp;<i>For whom</i> do
we look? For our God&mdash;our Father&mdash;our
Friend&mdash;our Deliverer. (2.)&nbsp;<i>Where</i>
shall we look for Him? He is near,
though concealed. Then look for Him
in Christ, in whom He is reconciling
the world unto Himself, in whom He
is well pleased even with us. Look
for Him in His promises&mdash;in His ordinances&mdash;in
your closet. (3.)&nbsp;<i>How</i> shall
<span class="pagenum" id="p179">[p.&nbsp;179]</span>
we look for him? With faith&mdash;zeal&mdash;energy&mdash;determination
(Job xxxv.&nbsp;10;
Jer. xxix.&nbsp;13). 2.&nbsp;As to <i>waiting</i> for
Him. This is a state of mind frequently
enjoined and commended in the
Bible. Waiting implies faith&mdash;desire&mdash;patience
(P.&nbsp;D. 2643). When you
have found Him, fall at His feet and
confess your unworthiness. Resolve
to follow Him fully. Cleave to Him
with purpose of heart. Pray, &ldquo;Abide
with me!&rdquo;&mdash;<i>George Smith, D.D.</i></p>

<h3 class="tdc" id="o145"><span class="smcap">Penitential Waiting on God.</span></h3>

<p class="bq">viii.&nbsp;17. <i>And I will wait upon the Lord, &amp;c.</i></p>

<p>Believers are in the Scriptures abundantly
encouraged to wait upon God
(Ps. xxvii.&nbsp;14; Isa. xxv.&nbsp;9). In Ps.
lxii.&nbsp;5, it is suggested that this waiting
upon God is connected with hopeful
expectation of receiving a blessing.
The same truth is taught us by our
Lord in His parable on prayer (Luke
xviii.&nbsp;1&ndash;8). However long God delays,
we must wait expectantly. In our
text, however, we have the idea of
waiting upon God while He is hiding
His face from His people. The very
possibility that He should assume this
attitude towards us is depressing, and
not unfrequently in our religious exercises
we are haunted by the fear that
this <i>is</i> the attitude He has assumed
towards us. Through fears and doubts
that intercept our vision of Him, we
look up to see the face of our Father,
and behold only a cloud! In such
a case our faith needs quickening,
that our hopes may be raised and
our courage renewed. The following
thoughts may conduce to this end.
I.&nbsp;<i>God does not hide His face from us
because His blessings have diminished</i>
(Isa. xl.&nbsp;26&ndash;31; Jer. ii.&nbsp;13; xvii.&nbsp;13).
II.&nbsp;<i>God does not hide His face from us
on account of any weariness in His love</i>
(John xiii.&nbsp;1; Isa. xlix.&nbsp;15). III.&nbsp;<i>God
does not hide His face from us because of
any caprice in His nature</i> (Jas. i.&nbsp;16&ndash;17).
IV.&nbsp;<i>If God does hide His face from us, it
is only on account of our sinfulness.</i> This
is the dark atmosphere in which God
becomes lost to us (chap. lix.&nbsp;1, 2).
V.&nbsp;Consequently, <i>if God&rsquo;s face is hidden
from us, it is at once our only hope and
our positive duty to wait upon Him</i> (Jas.
iv.&nbsp;8). Let us wait for Him and look
for Him. 1.&nbsp;Penitently. 2.&nbsp;Believingly.
3.&nbsp;Patiently. Then will the Lord turn
us again; He will cause His face to
shine upon us, and we shall be saved.&mdash;<i>William Manning.</i></p>

<h3 class="tdc" id="o146"><span class="smcap">Necromancy.</span></h3>

<p class="bq">viii.&nbsp;19&ndash;22. <i>Seek unto them, &amp;c.</i></p>

<p>As bearing upon the doctrine of
necromancy, an exhaustive discussion
of these verses would involve the
following points: 1.&nbsp;Under the instigation
of a prurient curiosity, or
under the pressure of affliction, godless
men are wont to seek knowledge
and help from the spirits of the dead.
2.&nbsp;Hence, in every age of the world
and in every nation of universal history,
there have been necromancers,
wizards, &amp;c., known by various
names, practising various arts of
divination and legerdemain; playing
with the credulity of men and
women, and claiming access to supernatural
knowledge and power. The
spirits of modern times are the latest
species of this genus of necromancers.
3.&nbsp;This passage implies irresistibly
that God frowns upon and condemns
necromancy in whatever form.
4.&nbsp;The expostulations, rebukes, and
threatenings of the Lord, through
<span class="pagenum" id="p180">[p.&nbsp;180]</span>
His prophet in this passage, assumes
it to be impossible for man to get
knowledge or help for the living from
the dead. The power of <i>God</i> to send
back to earth the spirits of the dead
is quite another thing; yet as to this
the practical question is&mdash;Does He
see fit to use it? 5.&nbsp;Hence, to discard
the light of God&rsquo;s revealed Word
and to seek light and help from the
dead, is to hurl oneself against the
impermeable and impassable wall with
which God has shut in the living of
our world, and involves both positive
conflict against God and contemptuous
rejection of His Divine Word. 6.&nbsp;As
Satan has a natural sympathy with
everything abhorrent to God and
ruinous to man, we ought to look for
his hand in these agencies of necromancy,
to whatever extent God may
give him scope and range for action.
What these limits may be, who can
tell? It is man&rsquo;s wisdom to keep
himself utterly aloof from the sphere
of Satan&rsquo;s agencies and temptations.
7.&nbsp;Necromancers and spirits practically
league themselves with Satan
against God, and should be aware
that his lot must be theirs, and their
end be as their works, no dawn of
day ever breaking forth on the midnight
of their gloom.&mdash;<i>Henry Cowles,
D.D., Commentary on Isaiah,</i> pp. 68, 69.</p>

<p class="bq">viii.&nbsp;20. <i>To the law and to the testimony, &amp;.c,</i></p>

<p>This was one of the watchwords of
the Reformation, and since then it has
been a favourite text with Protestants.
The noble Sixth Article of the Church
of <span class="wsnw">England<a id="o147_fna1" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#o147_fn1">[1]</a></span>
is but an extension of
it. It assumes that there is one standard
of truth, one infallible oracle, to
which in all their moral perplexities
and spiritual difficulties, it is the
wisdom, if not the duty, of all men to
appeal. And <i>we</i> are persuaded that
we have this standard, this oracle, in
the Bible (H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I. 543). If men
neglect it,&mdash;if they strive to construct
a creed or direct their conduct without
it, two things are certain: 1.&nbsp;<i>They
lack the knowledge and wisdom essential
to success in life.</i> Their neglect of it
shows that they have no light in
<span class="wsnw">them.<a id="o147_fna2" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#o147_fn2">[2]</a></span>
2.&nbsp;<i>There await them disappointment,
disaster, and despair.</i> This is the teaching
of the other beautiful translation
which many eminent scholars have
adopted: &ldquo;To the teaching of God,
and to the testimony! If they do not
according to this word, they are <i>a
people for whom no morning dawns</i>&rdquo;
(H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I. 641).</p>

<p>&ldquo;But all who consult the Bible do
not obtain from it sure guidance: the
proof of this is the difference among
those who consult it, both as to belief
and practice. In support of the most
absurd doctrines and the most pernicious
practices, the authority of Scripture
is claimed.&rdquo; True, but the error lies
not in &ldquo;the law,&rdquo; but in the men who
refer to <span class="wsnw">it.<a id="o147_fna3" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#o147_fn3">[3]</a></span> If the Bible is to be
really helpful to us, we must consult
it <i>honestly</i> (H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I. 573, 574, 4854).
<i>Humbly</i> (H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I. 387&ndash;389, 562&ndash;567,
587, 599). <i>With a constant recognition
of our help of the Holy Spirit</i> (H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I.
622, 623, 2877&ndash;2882). <i>Prayerfully</i>
(H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I. 570, 571, 598, 4856). <i>Diligently</i>
(H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I. 576&ndash;580; P.&nbsp;D. 315).
<i>Intelligently.</i> (1.)&nbsp;In regard to the subjects
concerning which we seek instruction
(H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I. 540&ndash;542, 558&ndash;560).
(2.)&nbsp;In regard to our
<span class="wsnw">interpretation<a id="o147_fna4" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#o147_fn4">[4]</a></span>
and application of its utterances
(H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I. 544&ndash;550, 568, 569). The
man who thus uses the <span class="wsnw">Bible<a id="o147_fna5" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#o147_fn5">[5]</a></span> will
be cheered as he advances in life by a
dawn that will brighten and broaden
into perfect day. He will be led by
it to Christ, &ldquo;The Light of the world,&rdquo;
and following Him in loving obedience
and unswerving loyalty, he will
find the declaration for ever true,

<h3 class="tdc" id="o148"><span class="smcap">Unsanctified Suffering.</span></h3>

<p class="bq">viii.&nbsp;21, and ix.&nbsp;13. <i>And they shall pass through it, &amp;c.</i></p>

<p><b>I. Sin leads to suffering.</b> 1.&nbsp;This is
true of <i>individuals</i> (H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I. 4603&ndash;4612).
But because there is another
life and a future retribution, the full
results of sin are frequently not seen
in this life. Nay, the sinner often
appears prosperous, even to the end
(Ps. lxxiii.&nbsp;3&ndash;5). 2.&nbsp;But in the case
of <i>nations,</i> which as such have no
immortality, it is otherwise (P.&nbsp;D.
2544); it is more prompt; it is
often exceedingly terrible. This fact
should make those who have any love
for their children hostile to any
national policy that is unrighteous,
however politically &ldquo;expedient&rdquo; it
may seem. <b>II.&nbsp;There is in suffering
no sanctifying power.</b> God may use
it as a means of arresting the careless,
or of making good men better, but
there is in it no certain reformative
energy. On the contrary it may
harden men in <span class="wsnw">iniquity.<a id="o148_fna1" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#o148_fn1">[1]</a></span>
<b>III.&nbsp;Suffering
does nothing in itself to abate
God&rsquo;s anger against sinners.</b> We,
when we are wronged, often yield to
a passion of vindictiveness, which is
sated when we have succeeded in inflicting
a certain amount of pain on
the wrong-doer. But God&rsquo;s anger is
not vindictive, but righteous (H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I.
2288&ndash;2294); hence its terribleness.
As it does not thirst for suffering, it
is not satisfied by suffering. As long
as the sinner holds to his sin, God&rsquo;s
anger will burn against him, irrespective
<span class="pagenum" id="p182">[p.&nbsp;182]</span>
altogether of the suffering he may
have endured. Nothing will turn
away that anger but a genuine repentance
(ix.&nbsp;13).</p>

<p>1. In the hour of temptation, let us
think of sin not as it then presents
itself to us, but as it will certainly
appear to us when its results are
manifested (H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I. 4673&ndash;4676).
2.&nbsp;When suffering has come upon us, let
us regard it as God&rsquo;s summons to
repentance (H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I. 56&ndash;59); and let
us obey it with thankfulness that God
is willing to deal with us in the way
of mercy.</p>

<h3 class="tdc" id="o149"><span class="smcap">The Remedy of the World&rsquo;s Misery.</span></h3>

<p class="tdc">(<i>Missionary Sermon.</i>)</p>

<p class="bq">ix.&nbsp;2&ndash;7. <i>The people that waited in darkness, &amp;c.</i></p>

<p>The prophecies contained in this
text are of a mixed kind; they are
partly fulfilled and partly unfulfilled.
We have the authority of the Evangelists
to apply the passage to Gospel
times, and to prevent it from being
restricted to the Jews (Matt. iv.&nbsp;14&ndash;16;
Luke i.&nbsp;79; ii.&nbsp;32). Let us consider&mdash;</p>

<p><b>I. The view taken by the Prophet of
the moral state of the world previous
to the glorious change which makes the
subject of his prophecy.</b> 1.&nbsp;<i>The people
are represented as walking in darkness.</i>
Darkness is an emblem of ignorance
and error; and an emblem the most
<span class="wsnw">striking.<a id="o149_fna1" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#o149_fn1">[1]</a></span>
2.&nbsp;<i>But darkness alone
appears to the mind of the Prophet only
a faint emblem of the state of the
heathen:</i> he adds, therefore, &ldquo;the
shadow of death.&rdquo; In Scripture this
expression is used for the darkness
of that subterranean mansion into
which the Jews supposed the souls of
men went after death. Figuratively,
the expression is used for great distress;
a state of danger and fear at the same
time. Such is the state of the heathen.
The religion of the heathen has ever
been gloomy and horrible. 3.&nbsp;<i>The
Prophet adds another note of the state of
the heathen:</i> Thou hast multiplied the
nation, and not increased the
<span class="wsnw">joy.<a id="o149_fna2" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#o149_fn2">[2]</a></span>
He beholdeth them increasing
in number only to multiply their
<span class="wsnw">misery.<a id="o149_fna3" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#o149_fn3">[3]</a></span>
Universal experience proves that misery is multiplied when
God and truth are unknown. In this
case there is no redeeming principle;
the remedy is lost; despair completes
the wretchedness of the people, and
were it not for the prospects opened
by the Gospel, that despair would
be final and absolute. Here, however,
the text breaks upon us with a
glorious and cheering view. The
Prophet beholds a light rising in
obscurity; a great light dispels the
heavy gloom; comfort, joy, and salvation
dawn upon the earth (ver. 2).</p>

<p><b>II. On the blessed visitation we
would now fix your attention.</b> 1.&nbsp;<i>As
darkness is an emblem of the religious
sorrow which had overcast the world, so
light is an emblem of the truth of the
Gospel.</i> The Gospel is &ldquo;light.&rdquo;
(1.)&nbsp;This marks its origin from heaven.
(2.)&nbsp;This notes its truth. It is fitting
that what is truth, without mixture
of error, should be compared to what
is the most simple substance in nature.
(3.)&nbsp;It is called &ldquo;light&rdquo; because of
its penetrating and subtle nature.
(4.)&nbsp;Because of the discoveries which
it makes. (5.)&nbsp;Because it is life and
health to the world. 2.&nbsp;<i>As in the
vision light succeeds to darkness, so also
joy succeeds to fear and misery</i> (ver. 3).
The joy here described is no common
feeling; it is the joy of harvest, the
joy of victory. The effect of the
diffusion of the Gospel in producing
joy is a constant theme of prophecy
(chap. xxiv.&nbsp;16; Ps. xcviii.&nbsp;8; Luke ii.&nbsp;10).
True joy, as yet, there is none
<span class="pagenum" id="p183">[p.&nbsp;183]</span>
upon a large scale; of sorrow and
sighing the world has ever been full;
and as long as it remains in this state,
even sighs might fail rather than
cause to sigh. Even that which is
called joy is mockery and unreal, an
effort to divert a pained and wounded
mind; it gleams like a transient
light, only to make men more sensible
of the darkness. As long as the
world is wicked it must be miserable.
All attempts to increase happiness,
except by diminishing wickedness and
strengthening the moral principle, are
vain. The Gospel is the grand cure
of human woe. When it has spread
to the extent seen by the Prophet,
a sorrowing world shall dry up its
tears, and complaint give place to
praise (Isa. xiv.&nbsp;8; xxxii.&nbsp;17). They
shall joy as in victory, for the rod
of the grand oppressor shall be broken;
Satan shall fall, his reign be terminated;
and one universal, transporting
&ldquo;Hallelujah&rdquo; ascend from every land,
to the honour of Him by whom the
victory is achieved.</p>

<p><b>III.</b> So vast a change must be
produced by causes proportionably
powerful; and to <b>the means by which
this astonishing revolution is effected,</b>
the Prophet next directs our attention
(vers. 4, 5). These words speak of
resistance and a struggle. He that
expects the conversion of the world
without the most zealous application
and perseverance among God&rsquo;s agents,
and opposition from His enemies,
has not counted the cost. In the
conduct of this battle two things distinguish
it from every other contest:
The absolute weakness and insufficiency
of the <span class="wsnw">assailants,<a id="o149_fna4" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#o149_fn4">[4]</a></span>
and their miraculous success. A remembrance
of these things encourages us in our
missionary operations. If our plans
had been applauded by the wisdom
of this world, there would have
been too much of man in them, and
we might have doubted the result
(Jud. vii.&nbsp;2). The victory shall be
eminently of God. For the battle
shall be, not &ldquo;with confused noise,
and garments rolled in blood, but
with burning and fuel of fire.&rdquo; The
demonstration of the Spirit, the power
of God, is here compared to fire. The
Spirit, in His saving operations, is
always in Scripture compared to the
most powerful principles in nature&mdash;to
the rain and dew, to wind, to
thunder, to fire. All these images
denote His efficiency and the suddenness
of the success; and the extent of
the benefit shall proclaim the victory
to be the Lord&rsquo;s. We have seen the
effect of this vital influence at home;
and we may, in some degree, conjecture
what will be done abroad. Yet perhaps
something very remarkable may
take place, as is intimated in the text;
some peculiar exertion of the Divine
power upon the mind of the world.</p>

<p><b>IV.</b> But it may be said, &ldquo;is not
all this a splendid vision? You speak
of weak instruments effecting a miraculous
success; of the display and operation
of a supernatural power touching
the hearts of men and changing the
moral state of the world, but what is
the ground of this expectation?&rdquo; This
natural and very proper question our
text answers (vers. 6, 7). In these
verses we have <b>the grounds of that
expectation of success which we form
as to missionary efforts.</b> The plan of
Christianising the world is not ours;
it was laid in the mind of God before
the world was. The principal arrangements
of the scheme are not left
to us, but are already fixed by the
infinite wisdom of God. The part
we fill is very subordinate; and we
expect success, not for the wisdom or
the fitness of the means themselves,
but because they are connected with
mightier motives, whose success is
rapid, and whose direction is Divine;
because God has formed a scheme of
universal redemption, to be gradually
but fully developed; because He has
given gifts to the world, the value
of which is in every age to be more fully
demonstrated; and because He has
established offices in the person of
Christ, which He is qualified to fill
to the full height of the Divine

<p>Our text has set before us the
moral misery of the human race; the
<span class="pagenum" id="p184">[p.&nbsp;184]</span>
purpose of God to remove it by the
diffusion of His truth and grace; the
means chosen for this purpose; and
the ground of that certain success
which must attend the application of
the prescribed means under the Divine
blessing. It now only remains for
me to invite you to such a co-operation
in this great work as your own
ability and the importance of the
enterprise demand.&mdash;<i>Richard Watson,</i>

As the pall of darkness is drawn over the
world, the fair face of nature fades from the
sight; every object becomes indistinct, or is
wholly obscured, and all that can cheer the
sight or direct the steps of man vanishes. So
the gradual accumulation of religious errors,
thickening with every age, banished the
knowledge of God and His truth from the
understandings of men, till all that was sublime
in speculation, cheering to the heart,
supporting to the hopes, or directive to the
actions of men, passed away from the soul, and
left the intellectual world like that of nature
when deprived of light. The heaven of the
soul was hung with blackness, and &ldquo;their
foolish heart was darkened.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Watson.</i></p></div>

Alexander and several other modern
scholars read: <i>&ldquo;Thou hast enlarged the nation,
Thou hast increased its joy,&rdquo;</i> understanding the
Prophet to mean that the true Israel had been
increased by the calling of the Gentiles, and
that this increase had been a cause of great
gladness.</p></div>

<div class="footnote" id="o149_fn3"><p><a href="#o149_fna3"><span class="label">[3]</span></a>
If the Prophet speaks of the Jewish
people, he declares a fact remarkably striking.
One of the blessings promised to their founder,
Abraham, was, that his seed should be multiplied
as the stars of heaven and the sands of
the sea-shore. But that which was designed
as a blessing, and is described as such in the
promise, was made a curse by the wickedness
of the Jews. For what end, in the former
periods of their history, did they multiply, but
to furnish food for captives, slaughter, and
oppression? In later times, they have multiplied,
and spread themselves over the world;
but their joy has not been increased. Degraded
in character, and despised by the nations where
they sojourn, without a country, a temple, or
a sacrifice, they bear, like Cain, the marks of
God&rsquo;s curse, are vagabonds in the earth, preserved
to warn us of the just severity of God.</p>

<p>There is nothing, however, in the connection
to induce us to suppose that the Prophet
particularly contemplated the Jewish nation.
The same thing must be affirmed of every
nation that abandons itself to wickedness.
When nations are multiplied, their political
strength is increased; and happiness would be
multiplied too, were it not for sin. But in
wicked nations the &ldquo;joy is not increased.&rdquo;
This negative expression signifies the misery
is increased. God has not added His blessing;
and there is no joy.&mdash;<i>Watson.</i></p></div>

The weakness and insignificance of the
instruments used in breaking the rod and yoke
of the oppressor is sufficiently marked by the
allusion to the destruction of the host of Midian
by Gideon and his three hundred men. The
family of Gideon was poor in Manasseh, and
he was the least of his father&rsquo;s house; the number
of men assigned him was contemptible;
their weapons were no better than an earthen
pitcher, a torch, and a trumpet; the men who
dreamed of Gideon dreamed of him under the
image of a barley-cake. All this meanness
was adopted that the deliverance of Israel
might appear to be the work of God; and
this is the manner in which He has ever
wrought in the revival and spread of godliness
in the world. Who were the instruments of
spreading true religion in the Apostolic age,
we know; they were the despised fishermen of
Galilee. Feeble and unpromising instruments
have also been employed in subsequent revivals;
and for the conformity of the
present missionary system of this model we
augur will be of future success.&mdash;<i>Watson.</i></p></div>

<h3 class="tdc" id="o150"><span class="smcap">The Joy of Harvest.</span></h3>

<p class="tdc">(<i>Harvest Thanksgiving Sermon.</i>)</p>

<p class="bq">ix.&nbsp;3. <i>They joy before Thee according to the joy in harvest, &amp;c.</i></p>

<p><b>I. The joy of the natural harvest.</b>
Harvest was peculiarly interesting to
the <span class="wsnw">Jews.<a id="o150_fna1" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#o150_fn1">[1]</a></span>
Two things render &ldquo;the
joy of harvest&rdquo; peculiar and impressive:
1.&nbsp;It is the completion and
reward of the anxiety and labours of
the year it closes. 2.&nbsp;It furnishes
the supply of our needs in the year
to come.&mdash;We call upon you to
rejoice before the Lord to-day (P.&nbsp;D.
1710&ndash;1712), and to associate your
thanksgiving with the name of Christ
(Heb. xiii.&nbsp;15). Let all outward
gifts remind you of that unseen
Mediator through whom they flow.
Our gratitude should be deep and
fervent; it should bear some proportion
to the regret we should have felt
if God had withheld the blessings in
which we now rejoice, and had
<span class="pagenum" id="p185">[p.&nbsp;185]</span>
blighted the promise of the year.
Yet now, when these temporal gifts
abound, let us remember their inability
to satisfy the needs of the soul. The
satisfaction for these needs is to be
found only in Christ. He who had
more corn than his barns could hold,
now wants a drop of water to cool
his tongue. <b>II.&nbsp;The joy of the
spiritual harvest.</b> The vicissitudes of
the religious life are often compared
to those of the seasons (Ps. cxxvi.&nbsp;5, 6).
The Christian husbandman has
his anxieties, arising from the badness
of the soil, the unfavourableness
of the seasons, the delay of harvest,
the fear of final loss. Yet he has his
reaping seasons of joy even in this
world&mdash;1.&nbsp;When a consciousness of
sin which has long oppressed the soul
is exchanged for a sense of pardoning
mercy, through the application of the
blood of sprinkling. 2.&nbsp;When, after
a long period of depression, hope revisits
the mind (H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I. 313, 314,
1658, 1659, 3041). 3.&nbsp;When there
come to us the answers to our prayers
that were long delayed (H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I. 3895,
3896). &ldquo;Hope deferred maketh the
heart sick; <i>but when desire cometh,
it is a tree of life.</i>&rdquo; 4.&nbsp;When the
spiritual triumphs of the gospel are
made manifest; to parents in their
families; to ministers in their congregations;
to missionaries abroad. Just in
proportion to the toil and prolonged
anxiety is the rapture of success.
The harvest sometimes come to us
after long delay, after many anxieties,
after many fears (Jas. v.&nbsp;7, 8).
God sees fit to exercise His people
with the discipline of suspense, but
this is for their good (Lam. iii.&nbsp;26).
<b>III.&nbsp;The joy of the eternal harvest.</b>
When all Christ&rsquo;s people are gathered
into His immediate presence (Matt.
xiii.&nbsp;39); then will the declaration
of our text be fulfilled in the highest
sense of which it is capable. The
ransomed will rejoice when they
think, 1.&nbsp;<i>Of the grace that reigns in
their salvation.</i> By that grace they
were transformed from being tares,
the end of which is burning, into
wheat meet for the garner. 2.&nbsp;<i>Of the
great cost and care bestowed upon their
culture,</i> that they might be ripened
for the heavenly kingdom. 3.&nbsp;<i>How
often they despaired of their own safety.</i>
4.&nbsp;<i>Of their deliverance from the fearful
fate of the tares and chaff,</i> whose end is
to be burned.&mdash;<i>Samuel Thodey.</i></p>

<div class="footnotes"><h4 class="tdc">FOOTNOTES:</h4>
<div class="footnote" id="o150_fn1"><p><a href="#o150_fna1"><span class="label">[1]</span></a>
They had scarcely any foreign trade&mdash;none
till Solomon&rsquo;s time. Every family
lived upon its own inheritance and upon the
produce of its own land. Consequently if
harvest failed, all failed. They expressed
their great joy by solemn offerings to the Lord. Not
a field was reaped before the wave-sheaf was
placed upon the altar; and when it had been
waved there, amidst the loud thanksgiving of
the people, before the Lord of the whole land,
the messengers from the Temple carried the
proclamation to the husbandman, in the field,
&ldquo;Put ye in the sickle and reap!&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Thodey.</i></p></div>

<p><b>I. The Incarnation and Government

Him, 1.&nbsp;<i>As the Incarnate One.</i> &ldquo;Unto
us a child is born&rdquo; (H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I. 846&ndash;853).
2.&nbsp;<i>As a gift of Heaven to a fallen world.</i>
&ldquo;Unto us a Son is given.&rdquo; 3.&nbsp;<i>As advanced

&ldquo;The government shall be upon His

name,&rdquo; &amp;c. <b>III.&nbsp;The adaptation of
these qualities to the purposes of His

and He is the &ldquo;counsellor.&rdquo; 2.&nbsp;We
need reconciliation to God, and He is
our &ldquo;Peace.&rdquo; 3.&nbsp;We need support
under the calamities of life, and this He
gives us, for He is the &ldquo;Mighty God.&rdquo;
4.&nbsp;We need comfort under the fears
of death, and this He gives as &ldquo;The
Father of the Everlasting Age.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>George Smith, D.D.</i></p>

<p>&nbsp;<span class="pagenum" id="p186">[p.&nbsp;186]</span></p>
<h3 class="tdc" id="o152"><span class="smcap">The Government of Christ.</span></h3>

<p class="bq">ix.&nbsp;6. <i>The government shall be on His shoulder, &amp;c.</i></p>

<p>Let me caution you against mistaking
this government for that essential
dominion which belongeth to our
blessed Lord as God. To suppose
that this had been <i>given</i> to our Lord
would be to deny His essential Godhead.
The government here spoken
of is one that He receives: a delegated
government as the Mediator of the
covenant: that which we are told (1&nbsp;Cor.
xv.&nbsp;24&ndash;28) He will hereafter
deliver up to the Father. Three
particulars we may point out, in which
He exercises this dominion. I.&nbsp;He
rules <i>for</i> His Church, as &ldquo;The Lamb
in the midst of the throne.&rdquo; II.&nbsp;He
rules <i>in</i> His Church, being its alone
King and Lawgiver. The Church is
never for one moment to assume the
power of legislation; it belongs not
to her, but to Him: <i>she</i> has the executive&mdash;nothing
more&mdash;to obey His laws,
to carry them out according to the
mind of Him who framed them.
III.&nbsp;There is a third power&mdash;that which
He exercises in the souls of His true
subjects, ruling in and over them by
the power of His own blessed Spirit.&mdash;<i>J.&nbsp;H. Evans, M.A.:
Thursday Penny Pulpit,</i> vol. vii. p 337.</p>

<p class="gap">In this verse we have a constellation
of titles, all of which illustrate the
essential dignity and mediatorial claims
of Jesus, and tend to awaken the confidence
of the Church. The very first
declaration, His &ldquo;name shall be called
Wonderful,&rdquo; fitly prepares us for all that
is to follow, teaching us to expect something
beyond the ordinary works of
God. He is &ldquo;wonderful&rdquo; in His
incarnation, in His government, in the
counsels He originates, in the divinity
of His nature, in the eternity of His
existence, in the results of His mediatorial
rule, for He is &ldquo;the Prince of
Peace,&rdquo; swaying the sceptre of mercy
over an apostate and disordered world.
There is a beautiful consistency in all
this; for if the government of earth
and heaven, the sovereignty of the
Church and of the world, is to be
exercised by the Redeemer, it is necessary
that He should be possessed of
attributes equal to the immense responsibilities.
But these attributes are
His, and hence the command, &ldquo;Rejoice,
for the Lord reigneth!&rdquo; <b>I.&nbsp;It is a
cause of peculiar rejoicing to all good
men that the government of the world
is in the hands of Christ.</b> Their interest
and joy in this fact arise&mdash;1.&nbsp;From
the near and sacred relation in
which Jesus stands to them. 2.&nbsp;From
the glorious perfectness of His character,
which guarantees the wisdom and
blessedness of His sway. 3.&nbsp;From
the changelessness, perpetuity, and
destined universality of His rule.
<b>II.&nbsp;The sovereignty of Christ affords great
relief in contemplating the abject condition
of the heathen world.</b> The
heathen have been given to Him for
His inheritance, and He will certainly
deliver them from the superstitions and
miseries by which they are oppressed.
<b>III.&nbsp;This fact gives us a deep interest
in beholding the vast extent of the
universe of God.</b> Every part of it is
but a province in Christ&rsquo;s boundless
empire.&mdash;<i>Samuel Thodey.</i></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 class="tdc" id="o153"><span class="smcap">His Name&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Wonderful.</span></h3>

<p class="bq">ix.&nbsp;6. <i>His name shall be called Wonderful, &amp;c.</i></p>

<p><b>I. Christ is wonderful in His nature.</b>
He is wonderful, 1.&nbsp;In respect of <i>His
essential Godhead.</i> 2.&nbsp;In respect of <i>His
perfect manhood.</i> <i>All</i> excellencies were
combined in him as a man, unlike
even His most eminent servants, who
are distinguished for the possession
of <i>special</i> graces, which too often are
clouded by some opposite defect.
3.&nbsp;In respect of the <i>union in Him of Deity
and humanity</i> (1&nbsp;Tim. iii.&nbsp;16).</p>

<p><b>II. Christ is wonderful in His offices,</b>
<span class="pagenum" id="p187">[p.&nbsp;187]</span>
at once Prophet, Priest, and King.
1.&nbsp;As a <i>Prophet,</i> what wonderful disclosures
He has made to us of
the Divine nature and will, and of
human duty and destiny; with what
wonderful authority He spoke; with
what wonderful completeness and
beauty He fulfilled all His own commandments!
2.&nbsp;As a <i>Priest,</i> how wonderfully
He was at once sacrifice and
offerer: how wonderfully He still
carries on the work of reconciliation
(Rom. viii.&nbsp;34). 3.&nbsp;As a <i>King,</i> how
wonderfully He rules, with omnipotent
power, yet with lamblike gentleness.</p>

<p><b>III. Christ is wonderful in his relation
to His people.</b> 1.&nbsp;In the care
He exercises over them (Ezek. xxxiv.&nbsp;11&ndash;16).
2.&nbsp;In the abundance of the
grace which He ministers to them
(2&nbsp;Cor. xii.&nbsp;9; John i.&nbsp;16; H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I. 936).
3.&nbsp;In His condescending thoughtfulness
for each one of them (John x.&nbsp;3, 14,
<span class="wsnw">15).<a id="o153_fna1" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#o153_fn1">[1]</a></span>
4.&nbsp;In the perfectness of His
sympathy with them. He identifies
Himself so entirely with His people,
that they have not a single care, trial,
or temptation of any sort, but it is as
much <i>His</i> as it is <i>theirs</i> (H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I. 952&ndash;961).&mdash;<i>J.&nbsp;H.
Evans, M.A.: Thursday Penny Pulpit,</i> vol. vii. pp. 336&ndash;348.</p>

<p class="gap" id="o153A">We are continually struck with
one marked contrast between the greatness
that is human and the
greatness that is Divine: human
greatness the more it is examined
the less wonderful it appears, but
Divine productions, the more closely
they are investigated the more brightly
they shine. We shall see that Christ
is wonderful, if we consider&mdash;I.&nbsp;<i>The
excellences that compose His mediatorial
character.</i> God and man! Nor is this
a wonder to men only (1&nbsp;Pet. i.&nbsp;12).
II.&nbsp;<i>The stupendous blessings He bestows
on His friends.</i> III.&nbsp;<i>The reserves
of glory which He waits to exhibit in now
unseen and future worlds.</i></p>

<p>Behold Him, and 1.&nbsp;Never hesitate
to acknowledge Him as your Saviour
and Lord. 2.&nbsp;Yield a ready obedience
to His authority. 3.&nbsp;Anticipate
His coming in glory.&mdash;<i>Samuel Thodey.</i></p>

Oh, how &ldquo;wonderful&rdquo; must He be, that
suits Himself to the cares of all, as if He had
but one! cares for each as much as He cares
for all, and cares for each as if he <i>were</i> all!
We are lost in this deep. I sometimes get
some light from this thought:&mdash;Why, the sun
can shine into the attic as well as into the
Queen&rsquo;s palace; it occasions no difficulty to
the sun. Blessed Jesus! there is no difficulty
for Thee to supply all our minutest wants;
in Thee there is the abundance of power,
and quite as great an abundance of love.&mdash;<i>J.&nbsp;H. Evans, M.A.</i></p></div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 class="tdc" id="o154"><span class="smcap">Christ our Counsellor.</span></h3>

<p class="bq">ix.&nbsp;6. <i>His name shall be called&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Counsellor, &amp;c.</i></p>

<p><b>I. How Christ may be our Counsellor.</b>
Immediate, close and confidential
intercourse is involved in
our idea of taking counsel. When
we are in perplexity, we lay the whole
matter before a friend in whose wisdom
we trust. So we may spread our
difficulties before Christ in prayer.
Thus far, all is clear. But how can
we receive from Christ the answer
and guidance we seek? How does
an earthly friend help us in such a
case? <i>By producing a certain impression
on our mind.</i> He may do it by
spoken words, by letter, or even by a
gesture. The <i>manner</i> is unimportant.
So Christ guides us <i>by producing
impression on our mind; how,</i> we
know not, nor does it matter greatly.
The well-instructed Christian seeks
counsel from Christ in all things.
He prays for <i>daily</i> guidance. Special
difficulties he makes matter of special
prayer. Then, upon the mind previously
made calm and willing, there
comes a sense of rectitude, and a
feeling of resolution. One course,
generally that which involves most
self-denial and manifests least self-dependence,
comes prominently forth
in strong relief, as most to be preferred.
Its advantages each moment
look clearer and brighter; its consistency
with his religious profession,
<span class="pagenum" id="p188">[p.&nbsp;188]</span>
conformity to the will of God, and
true wisdom, are more and more
strongly impressed upon his mind.
He doubts no more. He has arrived
at a decision. Christ&rsquo;s counsel has
prevailed. It is our privilege thus to
be directed at every stage and in
every vicissitude of life.</p>

<p><b>II. Why we should take Christ for
our Counsellor.</b> Because in Him are
all the qualities that would cause
us to value and seek the counsel of an
earthly friend&mdash;tenderness, wisdom,
and power. He can help us to carry
out His counsels.</p>

<p><b>III. What will the effects of making
Christ the Man of our counsel?</b>
1.&nbsp;<i>A special consistency of Christian conduct.</i>
Inconsistency arises from listening
to contradictory advisors; sometimes
going to Christ, and sometimes
taking counsel from flesh and blood.
2.&nbsp;<i>A conformity and likeness to Christ.</i> You
will learn to love what He loves, and
to desire what He promises. In the
man who constantly makes Christ his
counsellor, there is begotten a spirituality
of mind, a deadness to the
world, a fixedness of purpose, a cheerfulness
of temper, a self-possession and
patience, which are scarcely conceivable
and quite invaluable. A man
is powerfully influenced by the company
he keeps&mdash;whether it be refined
and moral, or coarse and profligate.
What, then, must be the effect of
habitual intercourse with the Lord
of light and grace and glory?
3.&nbsp;<i>A preparedness for Christ&rsquo;s presence
in heaven.</i> What is the bliss of
heaven? It is the vision of the
Almighty; unclouded and uninterrupted
intercourse with the Saviour
and Lord of all. The more we have
cultivated this here, the more fitted
we shall be for it hereafter.&mdash;<i>Josiah
Bateman, M.A.: Sermons,</i> pp. 1&ndash;18.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 class="tdc" id="o155"><span class="smcap">The Mighty God.</span></h3>

<p class="bq">ix.&nbsp;6. <i>His name shall be called&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The Mighty God.</i></p>

<p>Various devices to escape from the
force of this declaration have been
<span class="wsnw">tried.<a id="o155_fna1" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#o155_fn1">[1]</a></span>
But after a discussion prolonged
through centuries, it is now
conceded by the foremost Hebrew
scholars of our time, that, whether we
accept or reject it, Isaiah&rsquo;s declaration
<i>is</i> that the Person concerning whom
he wrote should be called &ldquo;The
mighty God;&rdquo; which is merely the
Scriptural way of asserting that He
should <i>be</i> &ldquo;The mighty God,&rdquo; for
names Divinely given represent realities.
That the Person concerning
whom this declaration was made is
our Lord Jesus Christ is the conviction
of the whole Christian Church. <i>He</i>
is the &ldquo;Child,&rdquo; the &ldquo;Son,&rdquo; the
&ldquo;Mighty God,&rdquo; concerning whom Isaiah
wrote. Let us do more than give our
assent to this statement: let us think
about it.</p>

<p><b>I.</b> It is essential to soundness of
creed, and to any full realisation of the
doctrine of <b>the perfect humanity of
our Lord Jesus Christ.</b> He was a
<i>man</i> in the same sense that this is true
of any man here; whatever was essential
to perfectness of manhood existed
in Him. Unless we grasp this great
truth intelligently and firmly, 1.&nbsp;His
<i>example</i> can be of no considerable help
to us (H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I. 898). The example
of an angel, though it might excite our
admiration, would also smite us with
despair. 2.&nbsp;His <i>sympathy</i> with men,
because of His identity with them in
their experience, can never be to us,
what it has been to missions, one of
the most comforting and strengthening
of all thoughts (Heb. ii.&nbsp;17, 18; iv.&nbsp;15;
H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I. 872, 954). <b>II.</b>&nbsp;It is
equally necessary that we should hold
firmly <b>the doctrine of His Deity.</b>
That He is &ldquo;the mighty God&rdquo; is the
testimony, 1.&nbsp;Of His <i>works</i> (Matt. xiv.&nbsp;32,
33, &amp;c.). 2.&nbsp;Of His <i>words</i> (John
vi.&nbsp;48; vii.&nbsp;37; viii.&nbsp;12; &amp;c.; H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I.
836, 840&ndash;842). This doctrine pervades
the New Testament (H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I. 835,
838). The sum of its teaching concerning
Him is, that in Him God was
manifest, that He is the true God (1&nbsp;Tim.
<span class="pagenum" id="p189">[p.&nbsp;189]</span>
iii.&nbsp;16; 1&nbsp;John v.&nbsp;20). It is not
only one of the profoundest of all
doctrines, it is the most practical.
Let me doubt it, and how can Christ
be to me a Saviour? How can He be
more to me than any other eminently
holy and wise man who died centuries
ago, or yesterday? 1.&nbsp;What comfort
can I derive from the declaration that
He died for me? Could a <i>man</i> atone
for the sins of the whole world, for
my sins? 2.&nbsp;What comfort can I
derive from the declaration that He
now lives and is in heaven? If so,
as a <i>man,</i> doubtless, He will sympathise
with me, but how can I be assured
in times of distress and danger I
raise? or that, if He hears me, He is
able to help?</p>

<p>1. This complex Christian life of
ours can be sustained only by the
complex and unfathomably mysterious
doctrine of the Divine-human nature
of Christ, just as our physical life can
be sustained only by the compound
yet simple atmosphere we breathe.
To simplify the atmosphere by taking
away, if it were possible, either of its
main constituents would transform the
earth into a sepulchre; and to &ldquo;simplify&rdquo;
Christian doctrine by taking
away the doctrine either of our Lord&rsquo;s
humanity or of His Deity is the
destruction of spiritual life. 2.&nbsp;Let
us, then, accept in all their fulness the
declarations of Scripture concerning
the Person of Our Lord. Those
declarations transcend our reason, but
they do not contradict it (H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I.
851, 4809&ndash;4814), and they should be
joyfully accepted by our faith. 3.&nbsp;Let
us think much of Christ as the Son of
man, that by His example we may be
incited to strive after a noble manhood,
and that by the assurance of His
sympathy we may be sustained amid
all the struggles and sorrows of life.
4.&nbsp;Let us think much of Him as &ldquo;the
mighty God,&rdquo; that our faith may rejoice
in His ability to accomplish for us a
complete redemption; that our reason
and conscience may be let to bow to
the authority which must therefore
belong to all His utterances; that our
love for Him, which is tender and
ardent, may be also reverent; and that
our soul may feel itself free to give
expression to the feelings of adoration
that rise up within us when we contemplate
His perfections, His purposes,
and the work which it is declared He
has accomplished on our behalf.</p>

<p class="bq">ix.&nbsp;6. <i>The Everlasting Father.</i></p>

<p>We usually associate the name of
father with the first &ldquo;Person&rdquo; of the
adorable Godhead. But there is no
manner of doubt that the title here
belongs to our Lord Jesus Christ&mdash;to
the very same Person who, in
human nature was a Child born, and
a Son given up for the salvation of
men. But there is this difference:
the title given to the Son born is
not merely &ldquo;the Father,&rdquo; but &ldquo;the
<i>everlasting</i> Father.&rdquo; The title is not
&ldquo;Father,&rdquo; but the entire phrase.
Read more exactly in accordance with
the original words, the phrase is this:
&ldquo;the father of perpetuity, the father
of eternity, the father of for ever.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Father&rdquo; means here simply possessor
or author. To be the &ldquo;Father of
eternity&rdquo; is to <i>have</i> eternity, and to
<i>rule</i> in eternity&mdash;to be the Lord of
eternity. Christ Jesus, who hath the
government upon His shoulders, hath
it on His shoulders for ever; He is
King of kings and Lord of lords
throughout eternity. The eternity
here spoken of is not the eternity that
is bygone&mdash;if we may so speak of
<span class="pagenum" id="p190">[p.&nbsp;190]</span>
eternity; it is the ongoing and unending
duration that lies before us, and
Christ Jesus is Lord and Ruler of it
all. No doubt He who can hold the
future eternity in His hand, and who
can rule all its affairs, must have
been Himself the Unbeginning and
Eternal One; and the Scriptures
leave no doubts about that being
the attribute of our Lord Jesus Christ
(John viii.&nbsp;58; Col. i.&nbsp;17; John i.&nbsp;3).
But it is that for ever which lies
before us which Christ is here said to
be the Father of. He is so as its
Possessor&mdash;He has it; as its Originator&mdash;He
makes it what it is; as its
Controller&mdash;He rules in it.</p>

<p>I. Jesus Christ is the father of
the eternity that lies before us, the
father of the for ever, because He
Himself lives for ever. He has it.
Observe, this is true of the Second
Person of the Godhead in human
nature. The connection of the text
will not permit us to forget that. It
is the Child born and the Son given
who is said to live for ever. That is
a great thought; the fact that the
Lord Jesus Christ in humanity is to
live for ever is a stupendous expectation
and belief. Sometimes it has
seemed to me as it were more wonderful
even than the Incarnation. It
seems as if it would have been less
strange for the Son of God, for some
great purpose, to have clothed Himself
with a creature&rsquo;s nature, and then,
having accomplished that purpose,
to have laid down that nature as
a thing too far down from the Infinite
to be worn for ever. But now the
wonder is, that having made Himself
our kinsman, He is to be our Head
for ever, and is never to cease to wear
the human nature in which He died
on Calvary. That this is an important
thought appears from two considerations.
1.&nbsp;It is part of the
Divine promise of the Father to our
Lord, and it is a thing for which our
Lord prayed as part of His Father&rsquo;s
promise (compare Isa. liii.&nbsp;10, Ps.
lxxii.&nbsp;15; xxi.&nbsp;4). 2.&nbsp;It implies that
His work was finished to His Father&rsquo;s
satisfaction. It is clearly spoken of
as a reward for work well done.
Hence this title &ldquo;Father of eternity&rdquo;&mdash;hath
in germ within it the great
facts of Christ&rsquo;s death, resurrection,
ascension, and session in glory (comp.
Rev. i.&nbsp;18). From this fact two
inferences can be drawn, both of a
most consolatory and joyful character.
1.&nbsp;To God&rsquo;s people. What a Saviour
they have! They need never fear that
they will find a world in all the universe
where He is not with them, and
they cannot live on to any age when
He shall cease to be their light and
King. 2.&nbsp;The same thing brings
comfort to every sinner (Heb. vii.&nbsp;25).
Do not lose yourselves in a great
general thought of Christ living for
ever; rather narrow the broad and
grand conception, and fasten it down
upon the present fleeting moment.
Christ lives <i>now,</i> and lives <i>here</i>&mdash;lives
<i>here</i> and <i>now</i> to save the sinner and
bless the saint. Apply to Him, and
rejoice in Him that liveth now and
for ever and ever.</p>

<p>II. He originated this age that is
spoken of. As by His death He
secured His own immortality on the
basis of the faithful covenant, and
received life for ever because He had
done the Father&rsquo;s will; so by the
same completion of His mediatorial
work on earth He purchased this
immortality for His people. All that
is valuable in the prospect of unending
existence to any human being he owes
to our Lord Jesus Christ. He is the
father of the eternal age; it could not
have been without Him.</p>

<p>III. As Jesus Christ, personally
and in humanity, lives through this
eternal age, and as He introduced it
and gave it its great characteristics,
so the administration of its whole
affairs is in His hands. The Author
of our Faith is the ruler of its progress,
and that not on earth alone, but
in heaven (Matt. xxviii.&nbsp;18). What follows
from that? 1.&nbsp;What a terrible and
what a hopeless thing it must be
to resist Christ! To resist Him
effectually, we would require to be
able to do one or other of two things:
<span class="pagenum" id="p191">[p.&nbsp;191]</span>
We should need either to go beyond
infinite distance and get away from
Him that way, or live longer than
for ever, which is equally impossible.
The only question is this, &ldquo;Am I in
Christ&rsquo;s hands to be slain by Him, or
to be saved by Him?&rdquo; and that turns
on my submission to His will. &ldquo;Am
I to sit on the throne beside Him? or
take the other alternative and be made
His footstool?&rdquo; 2.&nbsp;What a good
thought it is for the Christian, that
he can never go away from Christ&rsquo;s
care, that He can never be for a
moment without his Friend watching
over him, and never in any place in
which he does not hear the music of
those precious words, &ldquo;Lo, I am with
you alway!&rdquo; (Matt. xxviii.&nbsp;20).&mdash;<i>J. Edmond, D.D.: Christian
World Pulpit,</i> vol. ix. pp. 145&ndash;148.</p>

<p class="bq">ix.&nbsp;6. <i>The Prince of Peace.</i></p>

<p>How peaceful was the scene when
the first Sabbath shone upon this
world! How reversed was the scene
when sin entered to revolutionise it!
Think of the widespread and woful
war which sin has entailed on this
world, and see the need of such a
Prince as our text reveals to restore
the primitive peace. See, too, the
magnitude of the work to which the
Redeemer stands appointed when He
is presented in the character of a pacificator
who is to bring this strife to a
happy conclusion for man.</p>

<p>I. <span class="smcap">The qualifications of Christ
for acting as &ldquo;the Prince of
Peace.&rdquo;</span> We find these, 1.&nbsp;In His original
personal excellence as the only begotten
of the Father. 2.&nbsp;In His Father&rsquo;s
ordination of Him to the office.
3.&nbsp;In the meritoriousness of the work He
accomplished as the substitute for
sinners. 4.&nbsp;In the station to which
He has been exalted, and the executive
power which has been lodged in His
hands. First of all, He has been
appointed Intercessor, to plead the
cause of His people on the foundation
of the work He has done for them;
and, secondly, He has been anointed a
King with all the influence and energy
of the Almighty Spirit placed at His
disposal to carry into execution all the
favourable purposes of the Divine
government on behalf of those whose
cause He has won by His intercession.
5.&nbsp;In the fervency with which His
heart is dedicated to the attainment
of His object.</p>

<p>II. <span class="smcap">The principal articles of
that peace of which Christ is, or
shall yet be, the ministering
prince to all who believe on Him.</span>
1.&nbsp;He hath effected reconciliation between
God and man. 2.&nbsp;In Christ we
cease to war against ourselves. 3.&nbsp;Our
Prince hath reconciled us to the angels.
4.&nbsp;Reconciliation is effected between
Jew and Gentile (Eph. ii.&nbsp;14&ndash;16).
5.&nbsp;The general reconciliation of man to
man, the destruction of selfishness,
and the diffusion of benevolence
Christ came by His dying for all, to
teach that all were as brethren, and
ought to regard one another with
fraternal affection. How much the
world required this lesson! How
imperfectly it has been learned

<p class="gap" id="o157A"><b>I. The character of Christ:</b> &ldquo;the
Prince of Peace.&rdquo; How wonderful and
glorious is this character when viewed
in connection with this title! Infinite
wisdom and almighty power employed
not for purposes of war, but of peace!
(Isa. lv.&nbsp;8, 9). 1.&nbsp;He procures peace.
2.&nbsp;He proclaims peace. 3.&nbsp;He imparts
peace. 4.&nbsp;He maintains peace.
5.&nbsp;He perfects peace. <b>II.&nbsp;The character
of His religion.</b> It is a religion of
peace. True, at its first introduction,
it leads to conflicts (Matt. x.&nbsp;34); but
in the end it secures a permanent
peace (Jas. iii.&nbsp;17). It will give
peace, but only on its terms.
<b>III.&nbsp;Character of the followers of Christ.</b>
They are the sons of peace. 1.&nbsp;They
<span class="pagenum" id="p192">[p.&nbsp;192]</span>
seek peace with God through the

a spirit like His own, and

<p class="bq">ix.&nbsp;7. <i>Of the increase of His government, &amp;c.</i></p>

<p>If any man asks, &ldquo;Concerning
whom does the Prophet write these
things?&rdquo; the answer is, &ldquo;Concerning
Christ.&rdquo; &ldquo;Of the increase of <i>His</i>
government and peace there shall be

The world has seen many
great empires, that bade fair to be everlasting,
crumble away; and in view of
the history of the past, it is unreasonable
to believe that any modern
empire, except so far as it is obedient
to Christ, will be more durable. This
is a world of change, and it is vain
to hope that political revolutions are
altogether things of the past. Two
thousand years hence, should the
present era so long continue, the map
of this will be very different
from what it is to-day. But the
empire of Christ is to continue for
ever. Unlike all other empires, it is
to be continually progressing in extent
and cohesion.</p>

<p><i>What are our grounds for believing
this?</i> <b>I.&nbsp;The distinct promises of
Scripture</b> (Ps. ii.&nbsp;8, xxii.&nbsp;27, lxxxii.&nbsp;8&ndash;11;
Dan. vii.&nbsp;13, 14). For a Christian
this is sufficient. But even to those
whose reverence for God&rsquo;s Word is
most profound and unquestioning, it
is interesting to see&mdash;<b>II.</b>&nbsp;That <b>the
nature of</b>
<span class="wsnw"><b>things</b><a id="o158_fna2" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#o158_fn2">[2]</a></span>
is all in favour of
the fulfilment of this prediction. Under
this division of our subject, look at
some of the differences between all
human empires and the empire of
Christ. 1.&nbsp;As to their <i>origin.</i> They
have usually been created by the
genius and energy of some great man.
But even such men as David, Alexander,
and C&aelig;sar are mortal, and
because it is impossible to secure a
constant succession of men of genius,
the empires they found crumble away.
To David and Solomon succeeds a
Rehoboam, and Rehoboam means ruin.
But Christ wields the enormous &ldquo;power
of an endless
<span class="wsnw">life.&rdquo;<a id="o158_fna3" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#o158_fn3">[3]</a></span>
2.&nbsp;As to their
<i>progress.</i> (1.)&nbsp;Vast empires fall to
pieces by reason of their very vastness.
Time brings many changes even to
great empires, and among them at
least a temporary weakening of the
central power; the heart is enfeebled,
and the whole body is enfeebled and
begins to decay. (2.)&nbsp;Great empires
afford multiplied opportunities for
great corruption, and this ultimately
kills a state. (3.)&nbsp;Great empires
include many conflicting interests;
there is a perpetual struggle to maintain
the balance of power; mutinies
and rebellions are inevitable, and in
the end some of these are successful,
and the empire is broken. But none
of these things can happen in the
empire of Christ; none of these causes
will tend to check the increase of <i>His</i>
government. 3.&nbsp;As to their <i>aims.</i>
This is a consideration even more
important and vital than the others.
All empires have really had for their
aim the aggrandisement of some
ambitious man or nation. The inspiring
motive has been supremely selfish.
Hence fraud and force have been
unhesitatingly employed for their
advancement, and, because God really
rules on earth as well as in heaven,
these things, though they secure a
temporary triumph, ultimately lead to
inevitable ruin (H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I. 4612, P.&nbsp;D.
2544, 2995). By similar means the
great empire has to be maintained,
and in every part of it there are
millions watching for an opportunity
to subvert it by the same means;
because its aims are selfish, it is hated,
not loved, by those over whom it
triumphs. But the inspiring aims of
Christ&rsquo;s empire are righteousness and
peace; it is to extend these blessings
<span class="pagenum" id="p193">[p.&nbsp;193]</span>
that His limitless resources are employed;
the manner in which these
resources is employed is in accordance
with the ends sought; and hence
(1)&nbsp;all the laws of God&rsquo;s universe are on
His side, and (2)&nbsp;He is loved most
intensely precisely by those over whom
His authority is most completely
<span class="wsnw">established.<a id="o158_fna4" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#o158_fn4">[4]</a></span>
<b>III.</b>&nbsp;If any further
confirmations of our faith in Christ&rsquo;s
ultimate triumph is needed, we have
it in <b>the history of the world since
His crucifixion.</b> When He was crucified
they nailed over His head the
inscription, <span class="smcap">&ldquo;the king of the jews.&rdquo;</span>
It was intended to be an act of mockery;
it was the declaration of a great
truth. And since then He has become the
King of the Gentiles also. The mighty
empire that tried to stop the progress
of His kingdom was ground to powder
in the conflict. And now by all the
most powerful kingdoms of the earth
He is, nominally at least, acknowledged
as the supreme Authority. That which
is nominal shall become real (Rev. xi.&nbsp;15).</p>

<p>Concerning the complete fulfilment
of the prediction of our text, we need
therefore have no fear. And hence,&mdash;</p>

<p>1. We can look without dismay at
the mighty forces arrayed against
Christ and His truth,&mdash;heathenism
abroad and infidelity at home (H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I.
642). 2.&nbsp;We can look forward to the
future of the world with hope. A
golden age is yet to dawn (H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I.
3421&ndash;3423). 3.&nbsp;We can labour for the
extension of Christ&rsquo;s kingdom with
all the hopeful energy of those who
know that the end of all their efforts
is not failure, but a glorious success
(H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I. 979, 1161, 1162, 1166&ndash;1168).</p>

<i>Upon the throne of David.</i> This was in
accordance with the promise made to David (1&nbsp;Kings
viii.&nbsp;25; 2&nbsp;Sam. vii.&nbsp;12, 13; Ps. cxxxii.&nbsp;11).
This promise was understood as referring
to the Messiah. The primary idea is, that
He should be descended in the line of David,
and accordingly the New Testament writers
are often at pains to show that the Lord Jesus
was of that family (Luke ii.&nbsp;4). When it is
said that He would sit upon the throne of
David, it is not to be taken literally. The
peculiarity of the reign of David was, that <i>he
reigned over the people of God.</i>&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. To sit
upon the throne of David, therefore, means
to reign over the people of God; and in this
sense the Messiah sits on his throne.&mdash;<i>Barnes.</i></p>

the Divine nature, God is one, as we meet
Him in the Old Testament and the Oldest;
in the New and the Newest. There are four
Testaments: an Oldest and an Old, a New

Nature of Things.</i> The Newest is Christ&rsquo;s
continued life in the present influences of the

unwritten; the Old and New are written; but
the voices of the four are one.&mdash;<i>Joseph Cook.</i></p></div>

<p>It may be affirmed with equal truth,
that from what zeal is in man we may
know what it is in God; and that
from what zeal is in man we cannot
tell what it is in God (H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I. 2229&ndash;2240).
We can tell what its nature is,
but we cannot tell its power. 1.&nbsp;Zeal
is in man an intense passionateness of
desire for the accomplishment of some
purpose; this leads to an energy and
continuity of action that in many cases
triumphs over obstacles, and accomplishes
what seemed impossible. True
zeal in man is intelligent, calm, persistent,
and unweariable; and all this we
know it must be in God. 2.&nbsp;But what
its power is in God we cannot tell.
Water in the mass, and fire in the mass,
is an utterly different thing from water
or fire on a small
<span class="wsnw">scale.<a id="o159_fna1" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#o159_fn1">[1]</a></span>
&ldquo;The zeal
of the Lord of hosts&rdquo; is a tremendous
conception which the mind cannot
grasp.</p>

<p>This declaration is the consummation
<span class="pagenum" id="p194">[p.&nbsp;194]</span>
and crown of a great promise concerning
the Messiah. It is the guarantee
that, great as that promise is, it shall
not remain unfulfilled; the heart of
God is set upon its accomplishment,
and He is &ldquo;the Lord of hosts.&rdquo; We
have here a general and blessed principle,
applicable to all God&rsquo;s promises.
For two reasons many human purposes
remain unfulfilled: those who entertain
them are not in earnest about them, or
they lack power to carry them into
effect. But both these essential requisites
meet in God&mdash;earnestness and
power. He makes no promise lightly;
He attaches importance to every pledge
He has ever entered into; and He will
fulfil His promises, according to the
largest interpretation that can be put
upon them (Eph. iii.&nbsp;20).</p>

<p>Let us use this declaration for the
comforting and strengthening of our
hearts. There are many great and
precious promises, <b>I.&nbsp;Concerning the
extension of Christ&rsquo;s kingdom,</b> <i>e.g.,</i> in
the words preceding our text. It is
declared that the influence and authority
of Christ shall be unceasingly
exerted with constantly augmenting
effect, until all the disorder and
misery of the world shall be brought
to an end. So glowing is the picture
given by the prophets of the world&rsquo;s
future that we are tempted to fear that
it will never be realised. But &ldquo;the
zeal of the Lord of hosts will perform
<i>this</i>&rdquo;; and those who by their prayers,
efforts, and sacrifices are trying to contribute
to the extension of Christ&rsquo;s
kingdom, may rejoice in the assurance
that they are not labouring in vain,
nor spending their strength for nought
(H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I. 979, 1161, 1162, 1166&ndash;1168;
P.&nbsp;D. 475, 517, 2465, 2466).
<b>II.&nbsp;Concerning the temporal well-being
of Christ&rsquo;s people.</b> 1.&nbsp;<i>Deliverance
in time of danger</i> (Isa. liv.&nbsp;17).
Illustrate by the account of the deliverance
of Hezekiah (Isa. xxxvii.), noting
especially that the promise then given
was enforced by the very same declaration:
&ldquo;the zeal of the Lord of hosts
shall do <i>this</i>&rdquo; (ver. 32; H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I. 4058).
2.&nbsp;<i>Supply for all temporal necessities</i>
(Matt. vi.&nbsp;25&ndash;34; H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I. 4507).
<b>III.&nbsp;Concerning the spiritual necessities
and ultimate perfection of Christ&rsquo;s
people.</b> After each of them Faith sees
written, though not with ink, &ldquo;The
zeal of the Lord of hosts will perform
<i>this</i>&rdquo; (H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I. 1063&ndash;1071, 1106, 1112&ndash;1119).
By and by there is to be a
great gathering of Christ&rsquo;s ransomed
ones in the heavenly world, and this
will then be their grateful acknowledgement
(Josh. xxiii.&nbsp;14). Meanwhile,
whensoever in our search of the Scriptures
we find a promise specially
adapted to our needs, let us lay hold
of it, saying with joyful confidence,

<span class="wsnw">God.<a id="o160_fna1" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#o160_fn1">[1]</a></span>
Consider what the hand is to man: it is the chief instrument
by which he executes his
purposes,&mdash;farmer, builder, artist, author,
&amp;c.; and by the hand of God is
meant His executive force in all its
varied forms. God has the means of
doing all His will, and He is not an unconcerned
spectator of human affairs&mdash;these
truths inspire God&rsquo;s people with
hope, courage, and joy; and they ought
to inspire with terror all who are in
rebellion against Him. His hand is
<span class="pagenum" id="p195">[p.&nbsp;195]</span>
outstretched, not for, but against them;
His irresistible executive forces are
certain to be put forth for their overthrow.
Alike for the warning of those
whose lives are not governed according
to the Divine will, and for the exciting
of holy watchfulness in those who are
trying to obey that will in all things,
let us study this prophecy for the purpose
of discovering, <b>I.&nbsp;The reasons why
God&rsquo;s hand is outstretched in anger.</b>
Remind you that this is not an exhaustive
statement of those reasons,
and that no man is necessarily safe
merely because his conduct is not here
specifically described, I point out that
among the things that put man in the
most extreme peril of destruction by
their Creator are&mdash;1.&nbsp;<i>Oppression</i> (x.&nbsp;1,
<span class="wsnw">2.)<a id="o160_fna2" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#o160_fn2">[2]</a></span>
2.&nbsp;<i>Hypocrisy</i> <span class="wsnw">(ix. 17).<a id="o160_fna3" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#o160_fn3">[3]</a></span>
3.&nbsp;<i>Stubbornness under Divine chastisements</i>
(ix.&nbsp;9, <span class="wsnw">10).<a id="o160_fna4" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#o160_fn4">[4]</a></span>
<b>II.&nbsp;The effects of the
outstretching of God&rsquo;s hand in anger.</b>
These are <i>terrible, increasing, continuous.</i>
<b>III.&nbsp;The mode of escape for those
against whom God&rsquo;s hand is stretched
out in anger.</b> Not defiance, but submission
and repentance (ix.&nbsp;13). <b>IV.</b>&nbsp;Let
us note with reverent and thankful
wonder, that <b>against the wicked God&rsquo;s
hand is long stretched out;</b> that it
does not, as it so easily might, come
down upon them instantly with destructive
force. What a proof we
have here that, while He is inflexibly
righteous, He is tenderly pitiful!
And what an encouragement we have
here to return to Him with penitence
of <span class="wsnw">heart!<a id="o160_fna5" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#o160_fn5">[5]</a></span></p>

It is so vast that the mighty ocean lies
in the hollow of it (Isa. xl.&nbsp;12). It is a hand
of power and skill, for by it the foundations
of the earth were laid; and all the wondrous
hosts of heaven fashioned (Isa. xlviii.&nbsp;13; lxvi.&nbsp;2).
In it our life is (Dan. v.&nbsp;23). When He
opens it, His creatures are filled with good,
and all their desires are satisfied (Ps. civ.&nbsp;28;
cxlv.&nbsp;16). By it the Good Shepherd feeds,
guides, and protects His sheep (Ps. xcv.&nbsp;7).
It is a good hand, helping all who are trying
to serve God (Ezra viii.&nbsp;22; Neh. ii.&nbsp;18). It
is a mighty hand, delivering His people (Exod.
xiii.&nbsp;3). It is a hand that controls those
who control others (Prov. xxi.&nbsp;1). Even the
shadow of it is sufficient protection (Isa. li.&nbsp;16).
It is a heavy hand when it rests upon
His people in chastisement (Job xix.&nbsp;21), and
still more so when it rests upon the wicked in
punishment (1&nbsp;Sam. v.&nbsp;11). It is outstretched
to fight against His enemies (Jer. xxi.&nbsp;5).</p></div>

<h3 class="tdc" id="o161"><span class="smcap">The Duty of the Afflicted.</span></h3>

<p class="bq">ix.&nbsp;9&ndash;14. <i>And all the people shall know, &amp;c.</i></p>

<p>God here complains of what Israel
did when grievous and prolonged
afflictions, sent by God, fell upon
<span class="wsnw">them:<a id="o161_fna1" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#o161_fn1">[1]</a></span> then they left undone what
they ought to have done, and did what
they ought not to have done; and this
opens up the great subject of <i>the duty of
the afflicted.</i></p>

<p>An entirely different interpretation
has to be put upon affliction in the
case of men whose sincere desire is to
govern their lives according to the will
of God, and in the case of men who
are living wholly unto themselves. It
is exclusively of afflictions that befall
men of the latter order that we intend
now to speak, though many things
that will be said apply to <i>all</i> the
afflicted.</p>

<p><b>I.</b> In the case of the ungodly, the
<span class="smcap">design</span> of the affliction is in the first
instance corrective, and then, in the
event of its not accomplishing this
end, punitive.</p>

<p><b>II.</b> Their <span class="smcap">duty</span> is&mdash;1.&nbsp;<b>To recognise
that their afflictions come from God.</b>
This is a fact that wicked men are
very slow to recognise; they prefer to
attribute their troubles to &ldquo;bad luck,&rdquo;
miscalculations on their part, superior
ingenuity or force on the part of their
human adversaries, &amp;c. They prefer
anything to a recognition of the awful
fact that it is God who is dealing with
them (H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I. 143). 2.&nbsp;<b>Submission
to the will of God.</b> This is frequently
the result of recognition that the affliction
comes from Him; men cease to
use such language as is attributed to
the Israelites (ver. 10). Were it not
<span class="pagenum" id="p196">[p.&nbsp;196]</span>
that sin dethrones the reason, this
would always be the case; but it is
not so,&mdash;men can be found so hardened
in iniquity that they resolve to fight
against God. Stoutheartedness in
affliction is an admirable thing; there
is a place for it; but it is utterly misplaced
when it leads men to struggle
against the Almighty. The only and
inevitable result is heavier affliction
and ultimate ruin (vers. 11&ndash;14.
H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I. 146, <span class="wsnw">147).<a id="o161_fna2" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#o161_fn2">[2]</a></span>
3.&nbsp;<b>Repentance
toward God.</b> (1.)&nbsp;Repentance is more
than submission (H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I. 4206&ndash;4209).
(2.)&nbsp;God will be satisfied with nothing
less than change of heart towards
Him. (3.)&nbsp;Here we reach one of the
most terrible results of iniquity; by
it men are incapacitated for naturally
doing that which is indispensable to
their salvation. Did not God pity
sinful men, they could never attain to
that state of heart and mind without
which it would be impossible for God
to forgive them. But Christ has been
&ldquo;exalted&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. for to <i>give</i> repentance
and forgiveness of sins.&rdquo; With the
outward stroke of affliction there comes
to the heart the inward grace of Christ:
let transgressors be prompt to submit
to the one, and to avail themselves of
the other (H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I. 145, 4210).</p>

<p>These, then, are the duties of sinful
men upon whom affliction has come.
Let your compliance with them be&mdash;1.&nbsp;<b>Prompt.</b>
Not to comply with them is
to perish. Not to comply with them
promptly is an aggravation of all your
former iniquity (H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I. 4247, 4248).
By delay you may exhaust the Divine
patience (Prov. xxix.&nbsp;1). 2.&nbsp;<b>Thankful.</b>
Adore the benignity of God, in that
He is willing to receive you on your
mere repentance; a repentance which
He Himself enables you to exercise. Remember
that where God sees it, He does
not merely turn away His chastisements
from the penitent transgressor; He receives
him into His favour, and blesses
him as a son in whom He delights
(Luke xv.&nbsp;22, 23). Men do not act
so. When their foes submit, they
require from them an indemnity for
the wrong that has been done; often
an indemnity that is intended to be
crushing, <i>e.g.,</i> Germany and France.
But God in all His dealings with
penitent sinners shows Himself to be
a God of grace (Micah vii.&nbsp;18, 19).
3.&nbsp;<b>Intelligent.</b> Do not imagine that there
is anything meritorious in your repentance
(H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I. 4225&ndash;4228). Remember
that God thus deals with you solely for
Christ&rsquo;s sake, through whose atonement
it has become possible for Him
to show mercy to penitent transgressors.
Here is an additional argument for the
exercise of repentance, that God Himself,
at so great a cost, had laid the
foundation on which He can deal with
you otherwise than in the way of justice.
If you persist in your iniquity,
and by your stubbornness leave Him
no alternative but to destroy you, He
will be able with absolute truth to say
to each of you, &ldquo;Thou hast destroyed
thyself!&rdquo; Even in pronouncing judgment
upon you, He will clear himself;
as did our Lord when He left Jerusalem
to its fate (Matt. xxiii.&nbsp;37,
<span class="wsnw">38).<a id="o161_fna3" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#o161_fn3">[3]</a></span></p>

The Ten Tribes had already suffered
many an affliction; their political organisation
had often been broken up by civil wars and
foreign invasions, as the house of unburnt
brick dissolves into mud before the rain, and
the flower of the people had been cut down as
lavishly as men cut down the cheap sycamores;
but with that stoutness of heart, that obstinate
toughness which in all ages to the present
has marked this race, the men of Ephraim
and Samaria seem to rise superior to every
calamity; like Solomon, they will change the
sycamores for cedars, and they will replace the
brick with hewn stones. The conversion of
Damascus from an ancient enemy into an ally
encouraged them in their hopes; but Jehovah
will confound their policy by bringing the conquerors
of Damascus upon them.&mdash;<i>Strachey.</i></p></div>

<p class="tdc">(<i>An Ordination Sermon.</i>)</p>

<p class="bq">ix.&nbsp;15, 16. <i>The prophet that teacheth lies, he is the tail, &amp;c.</i></p>

<p><b>I. The world is so constituted that
leaders of the people are at present a
necessity.</b> It is no disparagement of
oak trees to say that few of them are
sixty feet high; and it is no disparagement
of our fellow-men to say that
few of them are qualified to lead others.
In both cases we have to do with an
ordinance of God. We are all included
in it. We all need, in some respect or
other, to be led. This arises from the
disparity between human needs and
human powers. Our faculties and time
are too limited to allow any man to
dispense with guidance. Even the
accomplished statesman needs to be
guided in the matter of health by the
physician; the skilled physician needs
to be guided in building by an architect,
and so on through all the grades
of human life. Men need guidance
in commerce, politics, literature, art,
philosophy, and in religion. There is
to be a time when in this last respect
guidance will not be needed (Jer. xxxi.&nbsp;33, 34),
but that time is not yet. The
people still need guidance in religion,
because, 1.&nbsp;While in some of its aspects
it is so simple that a child is capable
of it, in others it is so profound that
they need the most thoughtful instruction
concerning it. 2.&nbsp;There are many
false forms of religion seeking to win
acceptance (Matt. xxiv.&nbsp;24; 2&nbsp;Pet. ii.&nbsp;1;
1&nbsp;John iv.&nbsp;1). 3.&nbsp;The natural tendency
of the human heart inclines it
to the acceptance of those forms of
faith which are most unscriptural.
This is the real secret to the power
of Romanism. To-day, therefore, the
people still need religious leaders, and
leaders of the highest order. Even
with the Bible in their hands, most
men need guidance (Acts ix.&nbsp;30, 31).
Woe to them, if they take as their
guides men who have not themselves
been taught of the Holy Ghost!</p>

<p><b>II. Leadership involves for the
leaders the highest honour or the
deepest shame.</b> Many aspire to lead:
few think of the difficulties and responsibilities
of leadership. 1.&nbsp;<i>The
man who leads his fellow-men well is
entitled to the highest honour.</i> He cannot
do it without noble qualities of mind
and heart. Those who are well-led
are, as a rule, not slow to acknowledge
and reward the service that has been
rendered them. 2.&nbsp;<i>But leadership does
not necessarily involve any honour at all.</i>
The post of prominence may only
bring out into view the leader&rsquo;s incompetency,
mental and moral. &ldquo;The
fierce light that beats upon a throne,&rdquo;
and upon a pulpit, reveals every speck
and flaw in its occupant. It is a perilous
thing to exchange the pew for the
pulpit. 3.&nbsp;<i>Through leadership a man
may reach the most utter degradation and
shame.</i> He may do this (1.)&nbsp;through
his <i>incompetency.</i> Admiral Byng might
have lived and died a respectable
English gentleman, if he had not been
made an admiral. Many envied him
when he was so gazetted: none envied
him when he was shot. Many a
&ldquo;stickit minister&rdquo; would have made a
highly respectable and useful church-member.
(2.)&nbsp;Through his <i>dishonesty.</i>
Many a leader, claiming to be the head
of a community, has really been its
&ldquo;tail,&rdquo; carried by it, not carrying it
on in paths of truth and honesty.
His aim has been, not the welfare of
his followers, but his own aggrandisement
and popularity; his concern has
been, not to speak the truth, but to
say what would be pleasant. His
was the sin of many who claimed to
be prophets in Israel (Isaiah iii.&nbsp;12,
v.&nbsp;20; Jer. v.&nbsp;31). It is a common
sin to-day, both in the political and
religious world. Let those who claim
to be ministers of God shun it. Self-seeking,
everywhere despicable, is in
the pulpit most hateful and criminal
(P.&nbsp;D. 2482). Let every preacher
regard as warnings those base prophets
<span class="pagenum" id="p198">[p.&nbsp;198]</span>
of Israel; let him endeavour to
realise that wonderful picture of a
true leader drawn by Christ&rsquo;s enemies
(Matt. xxii.&nbsp;16).</p>

<p><b>III. Leadership involves for the led
salvation or destruction.</b> It is not a
trivial matter to be well or ill led.
How true this is politically, commercially,
legally; it is not less true religiously.
That community shows little
wisdom that chooses its leaders carelessly.
That community is insane
which demands that its prophets shall
prophesy unto it only smooth things
(Isa. xxx.&nbsp;10). The following of
religious leaders who are themselves
led by the Spirit of God will result in
temporal and eternal well-being; but
trust in &ldquo;religious&rdquo; demagogues,
whose aim is not to speak the truth,
but to flatter those who listen to them,
results inevitably in social and spiritual
ruin. In self-defence, then, demand
of your minister that he speak
to you, not what is pleasant, but
what is true; and count him not
your enemy, but your best friend
when he utters what, just because it
is the truth of God, shall smite and
wound as if it were a sharp two-edged
sword (Heb. iv.&nbsp;12).</p>

<h3 class="tdc" id="o163"><span class="smcap">Two Constant Feelings in the Mind of God.</span></h3>

<p class="bq">ix.&nbsp;17. <i>Therefore the Lord shall have no joy in their young men, neither shall have
mercy on their fatherless and widows.</i></p>

<p>From one point of view, this is a
terrible text! it shows us that a people
may arrive at such a condition of
desperate and incorrigible wickedness,
that God may feel constrained, as the
upholder of truth and righteousness in
the world, to destroy them. But, on
the other hand, how worthy of thought
and thanksgiving is this revelation of
God&rsquo;s <i>constant</i> feelings towards two
very opposite classes of persons&mdash;those
who are most joyful, and those who
are most sorrowful.</p>

<p><b>I. God&rsquo;s feelings toward young men.</b>
He has &ldquo;joy&rdquo; in them, a fact of which
young men seldom think. Doubtless
He has joy in them, 1.&nbsp;because of what
they are; and 2.&nbsp;because of what they
may become. He has this joy in them
as their Creator. The great Artist has
a delight in all His works (Gen. i.&nbsp;31;
Prov. viii.&nbsp;31). Young men are a
realisation, more or less perfect, of a
thought, an ideal in the Divine mind.
Strength and comeliness of body, courage
and vivacity of mind, modesty
and generosity of heart, are the ideal
characteristics of a young man, and
precisely as they are actually found in
any young man, God has &ldquo;joy&rdquo; in
him, just as He has joy in the strength
of the horse, the beauty of the swan,
or the melody that is poured forth
by the lark or the nightingale. We
frequently see a young man who is
obviously a glorious work of God; and
had not sin so terribly cursed and
marred our race, all young men would
have been such as the British youths
whose beauty called forth the old
pleasant jest, &ldquo;Not Angles but angels.&rdquo;</p>

<p>All this is, of course, equally true of
young women. For the Bible is in
this respect to be interpreted like our
English laws, concerning which it is
decreed that the word &ldquo;man&rdquo; shall
mean &ldquo;woman&rdquo; also in all cases in which
nature herself does not forbid
such an interpretation. A young
woman is more than a pleasing mass
of flesh and blood; she is a realisation
of a thought of God, a work of the
unseen Artist, to whom all that is
beautiful in the universe owes its
<span class="wsnw">existence.<a id="o163_fna1" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#o163_fn1">[1]</a></span>
Many a young woman is
so beautiful that the human artist
counts himself happy indeed if he can
make on the canvas any fair transcript
of her loveliness; and, what is
better still, the beautiful body is but
a casket in which a more beautiful
body is enshrined.</p>

<p>Young men and women, think of
this&mdash;God delights in you! What
<span class="pagenum" id="p199">[p.&nbsp;199]</span>
effects will a realisation of this thought
have upon you? 1.&nbsp;<i>It will check that
vanity by which the strength of the young
man and the beauty of the young woman
are often so pitifully marred</i> (1&nbsp;Cor. iv.&nbsp;7).
2.&nbsp;<i>It will cause you to reverence
yourselves.</i> Those who think that no
one cares for them, are apt not to care
for themselves; but consciousness that
we are observed leads us to circumspection
and self-control. If the observation
be friendly and approving, it is a
stimulus to endeavour to merit it.
Respect kindles self-respect. Remembering
how God looks upon you, you
will shrink from doing anything that
will lessen His &ldquo;joy&rdquo; in you; you
will not voluntarily permit faults or
vices to mar the nobleness and beauty
that call it forth, any more than the
roses, if they had power of self-defence,
would give a lodgment to those insects
which blight the beauty that causes
beholders to joy in them. 3.&nbsp;<i>Kindly,
loving feelings toward God will spring
up in you.</i> Friendliness and love tend
to call forth friendship and love; just
as the sunshine and rain that in early
summer descend from the natural
heavens cause flowers to spring forth
from the earth.</p>

<p>Consider what joy God must have
had in the young man Jesus of Nazareth,
and why He had it, and resolve
that the same causes for this Divine
joy shall exist in you.</p>

<p><b>II. God&rsquo;s feelings towards orphans
and widows.</b> &ldquo;Mercy on their fatherless
and widows.&rdquo; A more familiar
thought, but let us not therefore overlook
its preciousness. How frequent
and how emphatic are the declarations
of God&rsquo;s pity for the orphans and widows
(Exod. xxii.&nbsp;22; Deut. x.&nbsp;18; Ps. x.&nbsp;14, 18;
lxviii.&nbsp;5; lxxxii.&nbsp;3; cxlvi.&nbsp;9;
Jer. xlix.&nbsp;11, &amp;c.) Yea, we are taught
that at least one-half of religion consists
in being like God in this respect
(Jas. i.&nbsp;27). God&rsquo;s pity is practical;
let those to whom it is promised trust
in it <span class="wsnw">confidently.<a id="o163_fna2" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#o163_fn2">[2]</a></span>
And let God&rsquo;s
people make it their business&mdash;put
themselves to pain and trouble&mdash;to be
like Him in this respect: <i>this</i> is the
way to secure His favour for themselves.</p>

There are no such promises to those
who are free from sorrow and trial as are
full and abundant to the afflicted. A good
country physician in New England went to a
neighbour&rsquo;s house to tell a wife and mother of
the sudden death of her absent husband. She
was more than ordinarily frail and dependent.
She had a large family. Her husband had
acquired no property. The fresh blow was
indeed terrible to her. When the first wild
burst of sorrow was over, she looked up
through her tears to her sympathising friend,
and said in agony, &ldquo;But, Doctor, <i>what</i> shall
I do?&rdquo; &ldquo;My dear woman, I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo;
said the kind-hearted physician. &ldquo;All I can
say is, I only wish I had as many promises of
God to take right home to myself as you have
just now. The Bible is full of promises to
those who are in your case.&rdquo; And the
stricken woman lived to realise the truth
and preciousness of the richest of those promises.&mdash;<i>Trumbull.</i></p></div>

The anger which God feels and displays
is always against <i>sin.</i> It is never against
sinners as offenders against Himself personally,
but as violators of the eternal laws of
righteousness and love. It is not possible for
the most daring transgressor to injure God in
the slightest degree, and therefore He can
never feel anything approaching to that personal
vindictiveness which we feel against
<span class="pagenum" id="p200">[p.&nbsp;200]</span>
those who have wronged us. There are some
passages which at first sight convey a different
impression, as when it is said, &ldquo;Know therefore
that the Lord thy God&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. repayeth
them that hate Him to their face, to destroy
them; He will not be slack to him that
hateth Him; He will repay him to his face&rdquo;
(Deut. vii.&nbsp;10); and again, &ldquo;God is jealous,
and the Lord revengeth, and is furious; the
Lord will take vengeance upon His adversaries&rdquo;
(Nahum i.&nbsp;2). But terrible as such
passages are, they admit of a ready explanation.
In them God manifestly speaks as
&ldquo;the Judge of all the earth,&rdquo; as the Representative
and Administrator of righteousness.
Some years ago, proclamations denouncing
the severest penalties against Fenianism were
issued in the name of our beloved Queen; but
no one imagined that she cherished any personal
hostility against those offenders against
her authority. Every month it is her melancholy
duty to sign documents that consign
convicted murderers to the scaffold, but no
one regards these death-warrants as any proof
that she delights in the sufferings of those
whose sentence she confirms. Nor will any
thoughtful person interpret such passages as
setting forth anything else than God&rsquo;s resolve
to be faithful to His duties as the supreme
administrator of justice, notwithstanding that
in being so He must perform many things
that are revolting to His infinite tenderness
and compassion. His expostulations with sinners
to repent and turn from their transgressions
are a sufficient confirmation of this
interpretation (Ezek. xviii.&nbsp;31, 32, &amp;c.) His
anger against sin and sinners is no passion of
personal vindictiveness, but is the natural revulsion
of purity from impurity, of honesty
from fraud, of truthfulness for falsehood; this
instinctive abhorrence of generosity for meanness,
of benevolence for malice, of kindness
for cruelty.</p>

<p>If God did not feel and manifest this anger
against sin, it would be impossible to respect
and love Him. If He could look down on the
mean and dastardly things that are done every
day, and yet remain cold and emotionless as
an iceberg, as indifferent to the sufferings of
His creatures as some Oriental despots have
been to the miseries of their wretched subjects,
our whole soul would rise up in righteous
condemnation of Him.&mdash;<i>R.&nbsp;A.&nbsp;B.</i></p>

<h3 class="tdc" id="o165"><span class="smcap">The Destructiveness of Sin.</span></h3>

<p class="bq">ix.&nbsp;18&ndash;19. <i>For wickedness burneth as the fire, &amp;c.</i></p>

<p>One of the grandest and most fearful
scenes in nature is the forest on fire.
This is the figure Isaiah employs to
describe the destruction that was coming
upon sinful and stubborn <span class="wsnw">Israel.<a id="o165_fna1" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#o165_fn1">[1]</a></span>
That destruction would not be spared and the
wealthiest could not escape. And all
this woe, at which it behoved the
people to tremble, is attributed to the
wickedness in which they delighted.
&ldquo;Wickedness burneth as the fire&rdquo;&mdash;a
comprehensive statement eternally true.</p>

<p><b>I. Consider how true it is in regard
to individuals.</b> The forest-fire&mdash;1.&nbsp;<i>what
a trivial thing it may seem in its commencement!</i>
It was but a little heap
of dried leaves and sticks which a
thoughtless traveller kindles, that by
means of the little fire thus produced
he might cook his evening meal. He
had no conception how that fire would
spread. So the wickedness that ultimately
consumes and utterly destroys,
often commences in what seems a little
transgression, <i>e.g.,</i> the few glasses of
wine taken at a wedding-breakfast by
one who has been a total abstainer;
the little act of dishonesty that is undetected,
&amp;c. (James iii.&nbsp;5). Many of
the passions by which millions are
consumed&mdash;avarice, lust, intemperance,
&amp;c.&mdash;seem little things in their
commencement (H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I. 4497, 4498,
4513&ndash;4518). 2.&nbsp;<i>It makes progress according
to its own laws,</i> utterly regardless
of the desires of the onlookers.
It will not stop at any line which they
may prescribe. No man can accomplish
a desire to burn down just one
acre of a forest. If he kindles a fire
in the forest at all, it will advance as
far and as long as there is fuel for it.
So no man can determine beforehand
the measure of the power which permitted
wickedness shall acquire over
him; the fire which a man kindles in
the forest of his own passions will go
burning on long after he may wish it
to stop. 3.&nbsp;<i>Its power grows continually.</i>
It acquires a marvellous intensity and
fervour as it proceeds (H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I. 409,
4500, 4501, 4534&ndash;4537). 4.&nbsp;Consequently
<span class="pagenum" id="p201">[p.&nbsp;201]</span>
<i>it proceeds with ever-accelerating
rapidity.</i> Here again the moral analogy
is frightfully accurate. 5.&nbsp;Consequently,
too, <i>its range continually widens.</i>
That which began as a little point
becomes a vast circle constantly expanding.
Things that seemed so far
off as to be absolutely safe are speedily
included in the ring of flame. So the
fire of ungodliness which was kindled
in one passion hastens through the
whole nature, and destroys every vestige
of virtue and nobility; it seizes
every faculty of mind and <span class="wsnw">heart.<a id="o165_fna2" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#o165_fn2">[2]</a></span>
6.&nbsp;<i>It is remorselessly undistinguishing in
its effects.</i> The fair flowers and the
poisonous weeds, the stately cedars
and the misshapen brambles, it consumes
alike. So again with the sinner:
the wickedness that consumes him
spares nothing. In workhouses, lunatic
asylums, prisons, how many most
terrible proofs there are of the truth of
this declaration! Once the owners of
many choice possessions, and with
prospects as fair as those of any of us,
they are now like the forest region
<i>after</i> the fire&mdash;blackened and desolate.</p>

<p><b>II. Consider how true this is of
nations.</b> Wickedness consumes the
nation&rsquo;s prosperity, happiness, strength,
and ultimately its <span class="wsnw">existence.<a id="o165_fna3" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#o165_fn3">[3]</a></span></p>

<p>From all this there are many lessons
to be learned. 1.&nbsp;<i>He is a fool who
makes a sport of sin</i> (Prov. x.&nbsp;23). He
is infinitely more foolish than the child
who plays with fire. 2.&nbsp;<i>He is a fool
who does not stamp out the fires of unholy
passion the instant that he perceives them
beginning to kindle upon him.</i> In dealing
with sin, or in dealing with fire,
our only safety lies in the promptest
and most energetic action (H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I.
4733, <span class="wsnw">4734).<a id="o165_fna4" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#o165_fn4">[4]</a></span>
3.&nbsp;<i>Those nations are guilty
of suicidal folly who legalise vice in any
form.</i> 4.&nbsp;<i>Those who pander to a nation&rsquo;s
vices are traitors of the worst</i>
<span class="wsnw"><i>kind</i>.<a id="o165_fna5" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#o165_fn5">[5]</a></span>&mdash;<i>R.&nbsp;A.&nbsp;B.</i></p>

<p class="gap" id="o165A">In this message the prophet affirms
that there are resemblances between a
fire and sin. It is not a common fire to
which he refers, such as is employed
for domestic or public purposes. It is
a great conflagration which burns the
humble shrubbery, the gigantic forest,
extends over the land, and sends a
mighty column of smoke and flame up
to heaven. By attending to this comparison
some of the characteristics of
sin will vividly appear.</p>

<p><b>I. The origin of a great fire.</b> Recently
we read an account of a great fire, and
the paragraph closed with these words:
&ldquo;The origin of the fire is unknown.&rdquo;
Suppositions were made, conjectures
were offered, still a deep mystery which
may never be unravelled. The same
with the origin of sin. We know it
had a beginning, for God only is from
everlasting. We know it had a beginning
before Eve and Adam felt its
power, since they were tempted. We
know it began with him who is called
Satan and the father of lies. Still,
there are three questions about it
which we cannot answer. 1.&nbsp;<i>Where</i>
did it begin? 2.&nbsp;<i>When</i> did it begin?
3.&nbsp;<i>How</i> did it begin? These questions
might have been answered; they have
not, because such information is not
required by us in this stage of our
unending history.</p>

<p><b>II. The progress of a great fire.</b>
Place one spark amid combustible
material in London. Let it alone.
What will be the result? It will leap
from point to point, house to house,
street to street, until the whole city is
in flames. Sin has spread in an exactly
similar way. One sin, to the individual;
one wrong action, to the family; one
immoral look, to thousands; one crime,
to a kingdom. The sin of one woman
away in the East, some sixty centuries
ago, has spread itself amongst the
whole race; and there is not one who
has not felt, to some extent, its scorching
power.</p>

<p><b>III. The transforming power of a
great fire.</b> Wood, coal, &amp;c., it transforms
into its own essence, because it
makes fire of these. It is even so with
sin. It turns everything, over which
it gains the slightest control, into its
own nature&mdash;that is, into a curse. The
desire to <i>possess,</i> sin has turned it in a
different direction, and made it an
autocratic passion. Take the principle
of <i>ambition</i> the same way. Take
<i>commerce</i> in the same way. Thus the
<span class="pagenum" id="p202">[p.&nbsp;202]</span>
richest blessings, yea, all the blessings
which God has given to us, sin can
so transform that they shall become
curses.</p>

<p><b>IV. The destructive energy of a
great fire.</b> Who can calculate the
amount of property in London alone
which has been destroyed by fire? But
the destruction which sin has caused in
London is infinitely greater and more
momentous. Some have bodies once
beautiful, now bloated and withered
by sin. Some have feelings, once
tender, now petrified by sin. Some
whole intellectual powers were once
strong, now feeble by sin. Some, who
were once full of hope, now hopeless
by sin. The destruction which sin has
caused is awful. And this it must ever
do to all who touch it. Avoid it,
therefore, more than anything else.
Herein only is safety.</p>

<p><b>V. The termination of a great fire.</b>
It terminates when all the material is
consumed and reduced to ashes. Can
the fire of sin ever be put out in this
way? The body in the grave is
scorched by it no more; but what of
the soul? Look at the rich man. He
is tormented, in pain, not by a literal
flame, but by the fire of sin. He will
be so for ever, because the soul is
immortal.</p>

<p>A great fire has been terminated by
a superior quenching power. There is
also an element which can completely
remove sin from the soul. What is it?
Nothing can be more important than
the true answer to this question.
Health must depart, trade must be left,
money not required. Our souls must
live for ever. With sin, no heaven,
but hell. How delivered? Ask those
in heaven, and those on earth, who
have been saved. They all say that
the fires of unholy passion have been
quenched in them, and their guilt
removed, by the blood of the Lamb.
Apply at once to the same source.&mdash;<i>A.&nbsp;McAuslane, D.D.</i></p>

Civil war and foreign invasion shall
rage through this reprobate people like the
fire with which the husbandman clears the
ground of briers and thorns. The wickedness
of the land becomes its own punishment, and
burns with a fury which is indeed the wrath
of God, while its fuel is the people themselves.&mdash;<i>Strachey.</i></p>

<p>Wickedness, <i>i.e.,</i> the constant thirst of evil,
is a fire which a man kindles in himself. And
when the grace of God which daps and restrains
this fire is all over, it is sure to burst
forth.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The fire, into which this wickedness
bursts forth, seizes individuals first of
all; and then, like a forest fire, it seizes upon
the nation at large in all its ranks and members,
who roll up in the form of ascending
smoke.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. In its historical manifestation,
this judgment consisted in the most inhuman
self-destruction during an anarchial civil war.&mdash;<i>Delitzsch.</i></p>

<p>The picture of guilt grows darker still. It
is like destroying fire in the jungle of a forest.
The confusion and misery thus caused are
like the volumes of smoke that mount up in
whirling eddies from such a conflagration.&mdash;<i>Birks.</i></p></div>

Oftentimes a ruling sin will have power
little by little to colour the whole life with its
own tints; to assimilate everything there to
itself, as in ever-widening circles to absorb all
into its own vortex, being as it were a gulf,
a maelstrom, into which all that was better
and nobler in the man is irresistibly attracted
and drawn, and is there swallowed up, and for
ever disappears.&mdash;<i>Trench.</i></p>

<h3 class="tdc" id="o167"><span class="smcap">The Day of Visitation.</span></h3>

<p class="bq">x.&nbsp;3. <i>And what will ye do in the day of visitation, &amp;c.</i></p>

<p>These questions were addressed to
men who were living lives of ungodliness,
and who were rich and strong in
the results of their iniquity. To such
men I put the same questions. Do
not resent them; answer them, at least
to yourselves. All the warnings of
the Bible are warnings of true and intelligent
friendship, all its threatenings
&ldquo;are but the hoarse voice of God&rsquo;s
love, crying, Do thyself no harm!&rdquo;
(H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I., 604, 605). Let self-love,
which has been your governing motive
all through your life, move you to consider,
before it is too late, what you will do
in &ldquo;the day of visitation.&rdquo; It will
not always be with you as it is to-day.</p>

<p>I. There will probably come to you a
&ldquo;day of visitation&rdquo; in the shape of
<span class="smcap">Affliction.</span> You have known little
of it, but, if life be prolonged, it will
certainly come to you (Job v.&nbsp;7;
H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I., 47). In how many forms it
may come upon you! Broken health&mdash;blasted
reputation&mdash;poverty&mdash;bereavement:
these things may come
upon you singly, or in various combinations,
or all together. Men quite as
strong as you have been overtaken
and overthrown by them (H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I.,
3991, 4403&ndash;4406, 4975&ndash;4989). What
will you do in the day of visitation
and desolation? To whom will you
flee for help? To man? You will
then find what worldly friendship is
worth (H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I., 2016&ndash;2112, 2131&ndash;2137).
To God? But will He then
hear you? He does not necessarily
listen to men merely because they are
in trouble (Judg. x.&nbsp;14; Jer. vii.&nbsp;16;
Prov. i.&nbsp;26&ndash;31). It is the penitent&rsquo;s
suppliant only that God will hear and
answer, and your very pain and terror
may incapacitate you for the exercise
of genuine repentance; <i>that</i> consists,
not in dread of the consequences of
sin, but in disgust of sin itself. As
your friend I counsel you (Job xxii.&nbsp;21&ndash;28).
It is a mean and miserable
thing to have recourse to God only
when in trouble (H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I., 3877&ndash;3879).</p>

<p>II. But if your lot is different from
that of all other men, and no day of
sorrow ever dawns upon you, there
will come to you a &ldquo;day of visitation&rdquo;
in the shape of <span class="smcap">Death.</span> <i>That</i> is certain!
What will you do then? To
whom and to what will you flee for
help? Friends, wealth&mdash;what will be
their power or value then? And &ldquo;to
whom will you leave your glory?&rdquo;
For you will have to leave it (Ps.
xlix.&nbsp;16, 17; Eccles. v.&nbsp;15; 1&nbsp;Tim. vi.&nbsp;7).
And when you have left it, what
will become of <i>you?</i> Prepare for what
which is at once so inevitable and so
momentous (H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I., 1562&ndash;1566).</p>

<p>III. But that is not all. Beyond,
there is a supreme &ldquo;day of visitation,&rdquo;
the <span class="smcap">Day of Judgment</span> (H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I. 3045,
3055, 3061; P.&nbsp;D. 2100, 2103, 2106,
2107). <i>You</i> will be in that countless
multitude which will stand before the
&ldquo;great white throne.&rdquo; And you will not
be overlooked or forgotten then; <i>you</i>
will be judged according to the records
in &ldquo;the books&rdquo; that will then be opened
(Rom. xiv.&nbsp;12). Help&mdash;who can then
render it to you? Your &ldquo;glory&rdquo;&mdash;it
will have disappeared, or it may reappear
as your shame. None of the
things which secure for your consideration
now will have a shadow of importance
then. Do I speak to you as
a foe or as a friend when I urge you
to prepare for this inevitable meeting
with God? (H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I., 3062&ndash;3066).
The time to prepare is <i>now.</i> The way
to prepare, you know; put into practice
that which you have been taught.
Then all these days of visitation will
be transformed and stripped of their
terrors. In the day of sorrow you
will have a Friend who will know how
<span class="pagenum" id="p204">[p.&nbsp;204]</span>
to comfort you; in the day of death
that Friend will be with you, upholding
you in all that may be involved in
that profound mystery; in the day of
judgment that Friend will be the
occupant of the throne, and He will
speak to you, not words that will
blast you for ever, but words that will
fill you with eternal joy.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 class="tdc" id="o168"><span class="smcap">The Assyrian Invasion of Judah.</span></h3>

<p class="bq">x.&nbsp;5&ndash;34. <i>O Assyrian, the rod of Mine anger, &amp;c.</i></p>

<p>This prophecy may be used to illustrate
the following truths of abiding
interest. <b>I.&nbsp;The power of empires
and the policy of statesmen are all
under the control of God.</b> Free-will
is one great fact of the universe; an
all-controlling providence is another;
and God knows how to harmonise
both. In investing man with free-will,
God did not abdicate the throne
of the universe; He still rules, and
whether they do it voluntarily or
involuntarily, all men further His
purposes. 1.&nbsp;This is a truth to be
ever remembered by those who rule.
Their desire should be to work along
with God, and not merely in subordination
to Him. This is the one secret
of true prosperity and abiding power.
2.&nbsp;It is full of consolation for good
men when rulers are yielding to a
mad and wicked ambition (Ps. lxxvi.&nbsp;10).
<b>II.&nbsp;God exercises His control
of empires and statesmen for the promotion
of the welfare of His people.</b>
Every great empire has some underlying
policy that guides and controls
all its actions; <i>e.g.,</i> the underlying
policy of Russia is said to be the
ultimate acquisition of Constantinople.
God&rsquo;s &ldquo;great policy&rdquo; is the promotion
of the welfare of His people. In raising
up or casting down kingdoms He
has this object always in view. This
again is a profoundly practical truth.
1.&nbsp;The ruler who remembers it will at
least abstain from every form of
assault on the Church of God. He
who undertakes to persecute the
Church, undertakes to make war upon
Him from whom he received his
power, and who can instantly resume
it (Acts ix.&nbsp;4 and Matt. xxviii.&nbsp;18).
2.&nbsp;Remembering it, God&rsquo;s people will
not be dismayed in times of calamity.
They will look with assured confidence,
not for the destruction of the
Church, but of her persecutors; and
they will not look in vain. When the
&ldquo;whole work&rdquo; that God has in view
shall be accomplished, the ungodly
instrument by which it was effected
shall be utterly broken (vers. 12&ndash;20).
[All this belongs to a realm of truth,
the importance and preciousness of
which is not likely to be appreciated
in these times of freedom from persecution,
but by the martyrs in all ages
it has been well understood.] <b>III.&nbsp;In
the view of God the welfare of His
people is prompted precisely in proportion
as their holiness is promoted.</b>
We see from verses 20, 21, that while
God intended by the Assyrian invasion
to punish iniquity (ver. 6), His ultimate
design was to bring His people
back to Himself in penitence and faith.
Here we have, 1.&nbsp;A correction of our
views. We are apt to suppose that
by the welfare of the Church is meant
peace and outward prosperity. We
are satisfied if her revenues and social
influence are increasing. God often
thinks it better to take these things
away. The day of true welfare for
Judah begins when the fierce armies
of Assyria come up against her (H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I.,
3666). 2.&nbsp;Light is cast upon God&rsquo;s
estimate of holiness. So precious is it
in His sight, that He overrules even
the policies of great empires for the
promotion of it among His people. It
is distinctly revealed that this is His
aim in all the discipline of our personal
life (Heb. xii.&nbsp;10; H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I., 85&ndash;90,
2842, 2843). This should be to us,
then, 3.&nbsp;An instruction. We should
estimate holiness as God does. We
should constantly &ldquo;follow&rdquo; it (Heb.
xii.&nbsp;14; H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I., 2845&ndash;2848). And
besides humbly submitting to His
chastisements (Lam. iii.&nbsp;22), we should
<span class="pagenum" id="p205">[p.&nbsp;205]</span>
thankfully acquiesce in whatever
calamities He is pleased to send upon
His church or on ourselves, even
though they be relatively as terrible
as an invasion by the Assyrians, remembering
that His purpose therein
is to bring us back to Himself, to
make us like Himself, and so render
us capable of a happiness that shall be
perfect and eternal.</p>

<p class="bq">x.&nbsp;5&ndash;34. <i>O Assyrian, the rod of Mine anger, &amp;c.</i></p>

<p>The Assyrian. I.&nbsp;<i>His commission</i>&mdash;subordinate,
a mere rod in God&rsquo;s hands&mdash;defined.
II.&nbsp;<i>His pride</i>&mdash;he boasts of
his schemes&mdash;his achievements&mdash;his
strength and wisdom&mdash;of what he
will do against God. III.&nbsp;<i>His rebuke</i>&mdash;just&mdash;keen&mdash;humiliating.
IV.&nbsp;<i>His
punishment</i>&mdash;irresistible&mdash;sudden&mdash;signal&mdash;effected

<p>I. The mightiest nations are but instruments
of the Divine will. II.&nbsp;Are
employed to execute wrath upon the
guilty. III.&nbsp;God appoints their special
work. IV.&nbsp;Defines its limits.
V.&nbsp;Controls their ambitious purposes.
VI.&nbsp;Rewards them accordingly.&mdash;<i>J. Lyth, D.D.:
Homiletical Treasury,</i> p. 16.</p>

<p class="gap">We know what the Assyrians were
in the history of the world. They do
not stand alone; they belong to a class
of men who have appeared again and
again, and are numerously represented
in the world to-day&mdash;men of enormous
force, of abounding energy, of vast
ambition, of unscrupulous determination.
Such men as Ghengis-Khan,
Nebuchadnezzar, Alexander the Great,
C&aelig;sar, and Napoleon, are their conspicuous
representatives, but their
representatives only. They are to be
found elsewhere than on thrones and
at the head of armies. They have
been represented in the Church by ambitious
and unscrupulous popes, cardinals,
and bishops not a few. They
are represented among our nobles by
domineering landlords; in commerce
by great capitalists, who brook no
competition, but will crush a rival at
any cost. This chapter concerns men
who live in England to-day, and it
has for us more than an historic
interest.</p>

<p><b>I. The ambition of powerful men.</b>
Having power, they naturally and lawfully
wish to use it. The astonishing
and lamentable thing is the manner
in which they delight to use it. God
intends all the power that He gives to
be used for the same purposes as He
uses His own&mdash;for the upholding of
weakness, the relief of the needy, the
dispensing of blessing. But almost
always those to whom God intrusts
much power use it for self-aggrandisement.
Their delight is to crush others
(vers. 13, 14; H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I. 243; P.&nbsp;D.
244). Instead of doing their best to
resemble God, they do their utmost to
resemble the devil. What a pitiable
mistake! How much the ambitious
man thus loses! What a horrible perversion
of the means of blessing!</p>

<p><b>II. The godlessness of powerful
men.</b> 1.&nbsp;Mistaking the use to which
their strength should be put, they also
forget its source. They are so besotted
as to think that it is <i>theirs,</i> something
which they have originated; as if the
jets of a fountain should boast of the
water that leaps up through them,
forgetful of the reservoir whence it
comes (1&nbsp;Cor. iv.&nbsp;7). We see how
foolish this is; let us not forget how
common it is; let us be on our guard
against an error so common and so
absurd (Deut. viii.&nbsp;10&ndash;18; Dan. iv.&nbsp;29&ndash;31.
P.&nbsp;D. 2861). 2.&nbsp;Their godlessness
appears, too, in their imagination
that there is no limit to their
power (vers. 8&ndash;11; chap xxxvii.&nbsp;24).
In their projects there is no dependence
on Divine guidance and support, no
submission to the Divine will (Jas. iv.&nbsp;13&ndash;15).</p>

<p><b>III. The real position of powerful
men.</b> They imagine that they are
autocrats: they really are merely instruments
in the hand of God. God will
be served by us, voluntarily or involuntarily.
He knows how, without
impairing the freedom of the will, to
<span class="pagenum" id="p206">[p.&nbsp;206]</span>
use powerful men for the accomplishment
of His purposes; in much the
same way as the miller deals with the
stream that rushes past his mill&mdash;he
does not try to destroy it, or to stop
it, he merely turns it in among his
wheels, and then unconsciously it uses
its mighty force in doing his work
(vers. 5, 6; P.&nbsp;D., 2899). So it was
with Pharaoh: though resolved not to
serve Jehovah (Exod. v.&nbsp;2), he did
serve Him most effectively (Exod. ix.&nbsp;16).
So, though we may not be able
in all cases to trace it, we may be sure
it is with all wicked men (Ps. lxxvi.&nbsp;10).
God absolutely controls the vast
universe over which He rules: if we
will not serve Him as sons, we must
do it as slaves or as tools.</p>

<p><b>IV. The end of men who forget the
source of their power, and use it in a
godless spirit.</b> They are but rods in
God&rsquo;s hand, and when He has accomplished
by them what He intended to
do, He breaks them, and casts them
aside. In their folly they imagine
that they can never be broken (Ps. x.&nbsp;6);
yet how easy it is for Him utterly
to destroy them! Far-stretching and
mighty they seem as a forest, yet how
easily is a forest destroyed by fire (vers.
16&ndash;19). God&rsquo;s judgments are as axes,
by which even the monarchs of the
forest are brought low (vers. 33, 34).
By Isaiah we are reminded of three
historic instances in which all this has
been verified: the Egyptians (vers. 24,
26); the Midianites (ver. 26); the
Assyrians (vers. 17, 18, 32&ndash;34; xxxvii.&nbsp;36).
If we needed any proof that God
and His government of the world are
still the same, surely we have it in the
history of Napoleon I. Let the mighty
nations of the earth lay these lessons
to heart (P.&nbsp;D., 2787). Let all who are
disposed to vaunt their wealth or power
be mindful of them: the ruler or the
merchant-prince of to-day may be a
beggar tomorrow (1&nbsp;Sam. ii.&nbsp;3, 4, 7&ndash;10;
H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I., 4404, 4976; P.&nbsp;D., 149,
1617).</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 class="tdc" id="o170"><span class="smcap">Man Proposes, God Disposes.</span></h3>

<p class="bq">x.&nbsp;7&ndash;15. <i>Howbeit He meaneth not so, &amp;c.</i></p>

<p>&ldquo;Man appoints, but God disappoints,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Man proposes, but God disposes,&rdquo; are
proverbs which sum up a good deal of
human experience. We are often reminded
of their truth even when we
are striving to be on the side of God,
and to be co-workers with Him. There
will be great differences between what
<i>we</i> &ldquo;mean&rdquo; and &ldquo;think,&rdquo; and what <i>He</i>
has determined in reference to the
same <span class="wsnw">actions.<a id="o170_fna1" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#o170_fn1">[1]</a></span>
But more frequently
we see this in the case of men who,
like the Assyrians, are constructing
their plans in direct opposition to God,
fully bent on carrying out ambitious
and rapacious schemes. All the while
they are only agents in effecting
Divine purposes; they do what they
never &ldquo;meant&rdquo; to do.</p>

<p><b>I. Man&rsquo;s purposes are often godless.</b>
In the sense, 1.&nbsp;Of being formed
<i>independently of God</i> (vers. 11, 13, 14).
Men forget that God is inseparably
connected with us and all our movements
(Ps. cxxxix.&nbsp;1&ndash;12); they never
ask whether God will approve of their
plans, nor what will happen should He
frown upon them; they assume that
they have only to plan and execute,
forgetting the lessons of experience.
Their conduct is as foolish as it is
irreligious; irrational because it is
atheistic (Jas. iv.&nbsp;13&ndash;15). 2.&nbsp;Of
being formed <i>in defiance of God.</i> Men
harden themselves against the appeals
and warnings of conscience and Scripture,
and deliberately engage in enterprises
upon which they know they
cannot ask God&rsquo;s blessing, upon which
they know must rest God&rsquo;s curse.
Amid all their dark designs there is
the torturing thought, which they would
fain banish, but which clings to them
still, that there <i>is</i> a Sovereign Lord
whose counsel shall stand. <b>II.&nbsp;God
knows how to use man&rsquo;s godless purposes
for the furtherance of His glorious
designs.</b> This is done, 1.&nbsp;<i>Sometimes
by making an evil purpose the very means
of continuing and spreading His good</i>
<span class="pagenum" id="p207">[p.&nbsp;207]</span>
<i>work.</i> How often is this seen in the
history of persecutions! (See Acts
xviii.&nbsp;1, 2. The Pilgrim Fathers.
Tyndale&rsquo;s Bible. Martyrdoms, &amp;c.).
The means which men take for putting
out the light are used by God for
spreading it. 2.&nbsp;<i>Sometimes by allowing
the evil purposes to work on up to the point
when its success appears certain, and then
bringing about a totally different result.</i>
The device of Joseph&rsquo;s brethren only
needed time to effect God&rsquo;s purpose.
Haman; enemies of Daniel. There is
no stage of a wicked design safe from
the chance of utter confusion, and even
the last act that was intended to be a
triumph may turn out a tragedy.
3.&nbsp;<i>Sometimes the evil purpose is allowed to do
all that was intended, and yet God effects
through it His highest designs, even when
human wisdom would declare that the case
was hopeless.</i> The crowning example of
this is to be found in the suffering and
death of our Lord Himself. Every
step of that malignant crime, which
was thought to be a step towards the
utter destruction of the Saviour&rsquo;s
mission, was but helping on the
triumph intended in the counsels of
Eternal Love (John xii.&nbsp;32).</p>

<p>Learn, 1. <i>The folly of leaving God out
of our plans.</i> To plan without Him is
presumptuous arrogance (vers. 15). It
is to invite defeat, our knowledge being
so limited and so certain to leave out
some disturbing influence that will
frustrate all our anticipations. A
godless plan always means defeat in
proportion to its apparent successes.
The choice that really lies before us is
to work <i>with</i> God as His children, or
<i>for</i> Him as his slaves, His tools, His
instruments. Our choice will be left
perfectly free; but if we choose to reject
His paternal guidance, we shall find
that all we have secured for ourselves
is merely the contemptible
honour of figuring in our small way
as reprobates (Exod. ix.&nbsp;15). 2.&nbsp;<i>The
dignity of human life generally,</i> as
being comprehended in the supreme
plans of God (Gen. <span class="wsnw">xlv. 8).<a id="o170_fna2" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#o170_fn2">[2]</a></span>
3.&nbsp;<i>How to regard the disappointments of life.</i>
When things turn out differently than we
&ldquo;meant&rdquo; or &ldquo;thought,&rdquo; it is useless to
fret and fume against them. Instructed
by God&rsquo;s Word, let us humbly and reverently
acquiesce in our disappointments
as forming part of a plan of God,
conceived in paternal love, which is
unfolding moment by moment: each
event, whether bright or dark, having
its mission from Him, and clothed with
the grandeur of an unerring counsel.
If our purpose has been a righteous or
beneficent one, though it may seem for
a time to have been utterly set aside,
yet in the <i>end</i> we shall find that God
has used it to further results more important
and glorious than it entered
into our mind to ask or
<span class="wsnw">think.<a id="o170_fna3" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#o170_fn3">[3]</a></span>&mdash;<i>William Manning.</i></p>

<p class="bq">x.&nbsp;20. <i>And it shall come to pass, &amp;c.</i></p>

<p>Consider, <b>I. What is said of their
former error.</b> When it is said that they
&ldquo;shall no more stay upon him that smote
them,&rdquo; it surely implies that they had
done this before: this was their error.
They had stayed upon another&mdash;upon
Assyria as a refuge and defence against
the confederacy that threatened Ahaz
(chap. vii.&nbsp;1&ndash;12, viii.&nbsp;4&ndash;9), just as at
other times they relied upon Egypt as
a defence against Assyria,&mdash;and they
were to be delivered for this tendency
<span class="pagenum" id="p208">[p.&nbsp;208]</span>
to trust in human help, and were to be
taught to &ldquo;stay upon the Lord, the
Holy One of Israel, in truth.&rdquo; Three
things are here implied and expressed.
1.&nbsp;<i>They had exercised an improper dependence.</i>
To this we are all naturally prone.
We need help, and are apt to seek it
in some creature rather than in the
Creator. The evil of this course is, that
thus we are kept away from God (H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I.,
169&ndash;177). 2.&nbsp;<i>Their dependence had
been disappointed.</i> That on which they
stayed, not only failed them, it injured
them (2&nbsp;Chron. xxviii.&nbsp;20; Jer. xvii.&nbsp;5,
6). Creature confidence brings a curse
upon us in two ways. (1)&nbsp;By disappointments
(Prov. xxiii.&nbsp;5; Ps lxii.&nbsp;9,
cxlvi.&nbsp;3, 4; Isa. ii.&nbsp;22). (2)&nbsp;By
Divine rebukes (Jer. ii.&nbsp;17&ndash;19; Jonah
iv.&nbsp;6, 7). 3.&nbsp;<i>Their folly was to be corrected
by their sovereign.</i> They were to be
taught wisdom by the things they
suffered. But, alas! men often harden
themselves against even such
instruction (Isa ix.&nbsp;13; Jer. v.&nbsp;3; Amos iv.&nbsp;6&ndash;11).
Here we see the depravity of
human nature in rendering inefficacious
all these Divine chastisements. When
this is the case, there is a danger of one
of two things: either that God in anger
will throw down the rod (Hos. iv.&nbsp;17),
or that He will fulfil His own threatenings
(Lev. xxvi.&nbsp;21, 23, 24, 27, 28;
H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I., 145&ndash;147). God has a merciful
design in all your crosses, trials, and
afflictions (H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I., 56&ndash;74). When this
is accepted, and afflictions thus sanctified,
the penitent sufferer will put his
trust in God only. Thus the prodigal
was starved back &ldquo;He began to be in
want&rdquo;&mdash;and it was a blessed want that
led him to think of his father&rsquo;s house,
and resolved him to return. You have
no reason to complain when your
earthly props are taken away, if thus
you are induced to take fresh hold of
God.</p>

<p><b>II. What is said of their renewed
experience.</b> &ldquo;But shall stay upon the
Lord, the Holy One of Israel.&rdquo; Glance
at three views of it. 1.&nbsp;<i>It is an enlightened
confidence.</i> Confidence is the
offspring both of ignorance and wisdom;
ignorance leads some persons to
entrust precious deposits to strangers
or to villains, but the wise man seeks
first to know those in whom he is asked
to trust. It is foolish to trust without
inquiry, and to refuse to trust the trustworthy.
The Christian stays himself
upon God, because he has ascertained
what His character is (Ps. cxix.&nbsp;107;
2&nbsp;Tim. i.&nbsp;12). 2.&nbsp;<i>Their confidence is very
extensive.</i> It covers all times (Ps. lxii.&nbsp;8;
Isa. xxvi.&nbsp;4); all events that can
awaken our anxiety; every condition
in which we can be found; all that
appertains to life and godliness, not
only grace, but glory; not only our
journey&rsquo;s end, but also the way. Thus
it should be with us, but it is not
always so. Strange to say, while we
readily trust God for eternal life, we
often find it difficult to trust Him for
what we need in this life. How foolish
is this (Rom. viii.&nbsp;32; Ps. lxxxiv.&nbsp;11)!
3.&nbsp;<i>It is a blessed confidence</i> (Prov. xxix.&nbsp;25;
Ps. cxxv.&nbsp;1; Isa. xxvi.&nbsp;3; Jer.
xvii.&nbsp;7, 8; H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I., 1191&ndash;1934; P.&nbsp;D.,
1157, 1160).</p>

<p><b>III. The reality of their change.</b>
&ldquo;They shall stay upon the Lord, the
Holy One of Israel, <i>in truth.</i>&rdquo; This
confidence is distinguishable, 1.&nbsp;<i>from
mere pretensions.</i> There are those who
profess to know God, but in works
deny Him. It seems strange that
persons should act the hypocrite here,
for what do they gain (Job xx.&nbsp;5,
xxvii.&nbsp;8)? 2.&nbsp;<i>From imaginary confidence.</i>
Persons may not endeavour to deceive
others, yet they may deceive themselves
(Prov. xxx.&nbsp;12). How unreal
may be the confidence that seems most
assured. (Comp. Mark xiv.&nbsp;27&ndash;31,
with verse 50.) Therefore&mdash;</p>

<p class="bqpoemr">&ldquo;Beware of Peter&rsquo;s word,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor confidently say,<br />
&nbsp;I will never deny Thee, Lord,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But grant, I never may.&rdquo;</p>

<h3 class="tdc" id="o172"><span class="smcap">The Remnants of Society.</span></h3>

<p class="bq">x.&nbsp;20&ndash;23. <i>And it shall come to pass in that day, that the remnant of Israel, &amp;c.</i></p>

<p>We can hardly understand such
language as this, because in our national
life and personal history we have never
been subject to these strange mutations
which befell the kingdom of
Israel. We can hardly understand
what it means where a whole nation is
torn up by the roots, and carried away
into a foreign land; and where, by and
by, in the capricious mood of some
despot, a portion of them are allowed
to go back again,&mdash;a mere fragment.
For in the carrying away of a million
people, how many perish! And when
a few are gathered together, and they
turn to go back, how much is this
remnant to be pitied! Wandering
from place to place in the promised
land, crossing the Jordan, finding a
heap where once there was a flourishing
city, drawing near to the home of
their ancestry and finding it in the
hands of foreigners, themselves regarded
as intruders and outcasts, what a harrowing
experience theirs must be!</p>

<p>It was under such circumstances as
these that the prophets did their chief
work. It was one of their principal
functions to encourage a nation plunged
into profound despondency. In this
chapter, the prophet, with words of
cheer, and with an inexpressible richness
of imagery, comforts the poor,
despoiled band of people, and makes
them feel that the hand of power shall
not for ever be so strong against them.</p>

<p>Looked at in its interior spirit, as
God meant that it should be viewed,
is it not calculated to encourage and
comfort people who are in desolateness
and distress? Think what is meant by
<i>&ldquo;a remnant.&rdquo;</i> It does not mean simply
a few; neither does it mean merely
the last things; though it includes both
these ideas. There are &ldquo;remnants&rdquo;
in the tailor&rsquo;s shop, in the carpenter&rsquo;s
shop, in the household after a meal,
in the harvest field&mdash;the waste and
refuse that is left after the main and
best parts have been taken away and
used. So, in all the phases of society
there is a remnant constantly coming
up; it is the portion which is left after
the better or more favoured have been
culled out and used; the unsuccessful
man, and the men who have broken
down; and it is in respect to the
remnants of society that I am going to
speak this morning.</p>

<p>Consider God&rsquo;s great tenderness towards
the remnant of His people.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
Did you ever think of the remnants of
society&mdash;how numerous they are, and
how much they are to be pitied? We
are observant of the prosperous and successful,
but who cares for the remnants
of society? God does!</p>

<p>Let us look at some of these remnants.
I.&nbsp;<i>Those who are broken in health,
and are utterly turned away by that reason
from all that they sought.</i> How many
they are! How full of sorrow is their
lot! By accident or disease suddenly
rendered useless! Like a ship cast
upon the land, where the sun beats
upon it, and the heat shrinks and
cracks it, and opens the seams wider
and wider, till by and by it drops to
pieces. So it is their pitiful lot to be
able to do nothing but wait for the
end. II.&nbsp;<i>Those who have misapplied
their powers, and consequently have failed.</i>
How many give themselves to professions
for which they are utterly unfit!
Every day men are ruined because they
do not know what they are, nor what
they are set to do, and are not willing
to do the things which they could do,
but are aspiring to do the things
they are not fitted for. III.&nbsp;<i>Men who
were adapted to their work, but were
overtaxed, and who had not the endurance
which their circumstances required.</i>
Hundreds of men, under the
intense strain of modern society, break
down; and then all is gone so far as
they are concerned. IV.&nbsp;<i>A great many
more break down from a secret mismanagement
of themselves.</i> They live in
neglect or violation of the simplest and
most fundamental laws of health, or
they indulge in vices that are destructive.
<span class="pagenum" id="p210">[p.&nbsp;210]</span>
V.&nbsp;<i>They who have violated the
laws of society, and have been detected, convicted,
and branded with shame.</i> It is
scarcely possible for such men, however
earnestly and honestly they may
desire it, to be anything else than
mere &ldquo;remnants&rdquo; in society.</p>

<p>1. In regard to all those who are in
this great struggling mass&mdash;the remnants
of society&mdash;I have to say: Take
pity on them; have compassion on
them; do something to rescue, to
strengthen, to cheer some of them.
2.&nbsp;To all who are cast down and suffering,
I say, There is a God who is sorry for
you. If men disown you, God thinks
of you, and will succour you. Beware,
then, of desperation. Do not throw
yourselves away. Though all else
should be against you, God is for you.
There is immortality&mdash;seek for that.
There is bright and blessed manhood
just beyond. If you have failed for
this life, do not fail for the other too.
There is very much that may yet be
done, even in the afternoon and twilight
of men&rsquo;s lives, if they are hopeful
and active. Do not give yourselves
over to complaining and mourning.
Be patient. However low you may
have got, you have not got so low as
Christ was when He died a death of
shame and contumely for us. Shall
the servant be greater than his Lord?
Be patient. It cannot be long before
God&rsquo;s angel shall come, and then your
troubles shall be over. Pluck up your
courage. Wait. And if need be, suffer,
and suffer patiently to the end. Let
everything go but this: &ldquo;God loves
me; heaven waits for me;&rdquo; and in
that hope stand. Though the world
perish around you, <i>stand,</i> comforted and
cheered by the confidence that God
cares for you as the remnants of His
Israel (H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I., 958&ndash;961, 2310, 2311,
4015&ndash;4018).&mdash;<i>Henry Ward Beecher:

<h3 class="tdc" id="o173"><span class="smcap">Isaiah&rsquo;s Vision of the King and of His Kingdom.</span></h3>

<p class="bq"><span class="smcap">chapters xi. and xii.</span></p>

<p>This is one of the visions that Isaiah
<i>saw</i> (chap. i.&nbsp;1, ii.&nbsp;1, &amp;c.). He was a
dreamer of dreams. With a keen perception,
not surpassed, of the men and
things actually surrounding him, much
of his life was passed in an ideal and
future world. There he found comfort
and strength to endure the sorrows
that otherwise would have crushed him.
At the outset of his ministry, when
the great king who had done so much
to restore the prosperity of the nation
was about to be removed, there was
vouchsafed to him a vision of the King
immortal, eternal, invisible, throned
in the temple, and surrounded by the
exalted intelligences who do His will
(chap. vi.&nbsp;1&ndash;4); and now, at the close
of the wicked and disastrous reign of
Ahaz, when his hopes concerning his
race would naturally have failed, there
was granted him a vision of a King of
righteousness and peace, who on earth
would rule over a kingdom such as the
world had never seen. His soul had
been stirred and appalled by a vision
of disaster and woe. He was the king
of Assyria, then the terror of the earth,
utterly broken, his vast armies hewn
down as forests fall before the axes of
the woodmen (chap. x.&nbsp;33, 34); a vision
of blood and terror which may well
have filled him with trembling. But
just as sometimes the sweetest daylight
follows a night of storm, this
vision of terror fades away, and he
sees&mdash;</p>

<p>I. <span class="smcap">A King</span> (chap. xi.&nbsp;1&ndash;5). 1.&nbsp;<i>Royally
descended,</i> &ldquo;a rod out of the stem of
<i>Jesse.</i>&rdquo; A simple farmer on the hills
of Bethlehem, and yet a father of
kings. Not an accident. We are here
confronted with the mystery of blood,
of race. No common man was he
from whom sprang David, Solomon,
Hezekiah, Josiah, and a long line of
kings. In his ordinary hours, Isaiah
may well have derived assurance that
the vision that gladdened him was
given him from above, from the fact
that it was in harmony with God&rsquo;s
promise (2&nbsp;Sam. vii.&nbsp;12&ndash;16). Without
<span class="pagenum" id="p211">[p.&nbsp;211]</span>
dismay he could view the royal house
lapsing into the obscurity from which
it sprang&mdash;becoming merely a house of
<i>Jesse</i> once more&mdash;assured that in His
own time God would again raise it up
to <span class="wsnw">glory.<a id="o173_fna1" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#o173_fn1">[1]</a></span>
It is always well when
our hopes rest upon the Word of God.
2.&nbsp;<i>Royally endowed;</i> a King by truest
&ldquo;right divine,&rdquo; because possessed of
royal qualities of heart and mind (chap.
xi.&nbsp;2, 3). Of the thousands who have
sat on thrones, how few have possessed
them! How many have ruled over
the miserable wretches subject to their
sway merely by the craft of the serpent
or the cruelty of the tiger! Of those
who have been popular, how many
have owed their popularity to mere physical
prowess and politic good-nature
(Richard&nbsp;I., Charles&nbsp;II.)! How few
have endeavoured to approach the Biblical
conception of what a ruler ought
to be (Deut. xvii.&nbsp;14&ndash;20; 2&nbsp;Sam. xxiii.&nbsp;3;
Ps. lxxii.&nbsp;4; Prov. xx.&nbsp;28)! In
the marvellous superiority of that conception
to anything that has prevailed
among men, have we not another proof
that the sacred writers were indeed
inspired by the Spirit of God?
3.&nbsp;<i>Ruling in righteousness;</i> using His marvellous
endowments for the welfare of
those subjected to His authority (chap.
xi.&nbsp;3&ndash;5); not judging of things or men
by their mere appearance, nor by common
report; caring for the poor, befriending
the shrinking and helpless, fearless
in His dispensation of justice; His very
words being swords that smote and
overthrew the arrogant oppressor;
made strong by the very righteousness
which merely politic men would
have feared to display in view of the
might of iniquity in this disordered
world; a Hero of the truest and
divinest kind, in actual life setting
forth the ideal to which the noblest
knights in the purest days of chivalry
strove to conform. Such was the King
whom the prophet &ldquo;saw&rdquo; in an age
when &ldquo;ruler&rdquo; was merely another
word for tyrant and oppressor. Surely
the vision so fair and wondrous was
given him from above!</p>

<p>II. He also saw <span class="smcap">the kingdom.</span>
1.&nbsp;<i>A kingdom of righteousness</i> (chap. xi.&nbsp;9).
The kingdom necessarily resembles the
king. Appalling is the influence of a
court upon a nation. Correspondingly
great is the responsibility of those who
sit in high places. 2.&nbsp;<i>A kingdom of
peace.</i> Set forth by the most beautiful
symbolism (chap. xi.&nbsp;6&ndash;10, 13). 3.&nbsp;<i>A
kingdom of prosperity.</i> Those included in
it are no longer miserable exiles and
bond slaves; rather they rule over
those by whom they were spoiled and
oppressed (chap. xi.&nbsp;14). This is the true
interpretation of a symbol that is in
itself harsh and repulsive. The coarseness
of the symbol is due to the coarseness
of the minds it was first intended
to touch. 4.&nbsp;<i>A kingdom of gladness
and joy.</i> There pervades it the gladness
of exiles who have been restored
to their own land (chap. xi.&nbsp;15, 16); the
true and religious joy of men who
recognise that the deliverances which
inspire their songs have been wrought
for them by God (chap. xii.&nbsp;1&ndash;5); the
joy of men who are absolutely assured
of continual safety (chap. xii.&nbsp;2, 6).</p>

<p>Was all this merely a bright vision?
1.&nbsp;It has been already fulfilled in part.
2.&nbsp;In our own day it is being fulfilled
more completely than ever before.
3.&nbsp;It shall yet be fulfilled
<span class="wsnw">triumphantly.<a id="o173_fna2" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#o173_fn2">[2]</a></span>
Let us then, 1.&nbsp;Recognise and
rejoice in the fact that we are living
under the rule of this righteous King.
This is at least the dawning of the
&ldquo;day&rdquo; which Isaiah saw (Matt. xiii.&nbsp;16).
2.&nbsp;Exult in view of the certain
future of our race. The kingdom of
God shall come generation after generation
with mightier power (H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I.,
3421&ndash;3423). 3.&nbsp;Labour as well as pray
that future may be hastened.</p>

The image is now transferred to the
state and king of Israel, which is also to be
cut down to the stump, like the tree in
Nebuchadnezzar&rsquo;s dream. But out of that
stump, and from its living roots, shall grow
up a scion&mdash;one of those slender shoots which
we see springing up from, and immediately
around, the stock of a truncated tree. A
king of the race of Jesse shall sit on the
throne of his fathers, in accordance with the
covenant made with David (Ps. lxxxix.&nbsp;3, 4).&mdash;<i>Strachey.</i></p>

<p>When the axe is laid to the imperial power
of the world, it falls without hope (chap. x.&nbsp;33,
<span class="pagenum" id="p212">[p.&nbsp;212]</span>
34). But in Israel spring is returning (chap.
xi.&nbsp;1). The world-power resembles the cedar-forest
of Lebanon; the house of David, on
the other hand, because of its apostasy, is like
the stump of a felled tree, like a root without
stem, branches, or crown. The world-kingdom,
at the height of its power, presents the
most striking contrast to Israel and the house
of David in the uttermost depth announced
in chapter vi., <i>fin.,</i> mutilated and reduced
to the lowliness of its Bethlehemitish origin.
But whereas the Lebanon of the imperial
power is thrown down, to remain prostrate,
the house of David renews its youth.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
Out of the stump of Jesse&mdash;<i>i.e.,</i> out of the
remnant of the chosen royal family, which has
sunk down to the insignificance of the house
from which it sprang&mdash;there comes forth a
twig (<span lang="hbo-Latn">choter</span>), which promises to supply the
place of the trunk and crown; and down
below, in the roots covered with earth, and
only rising a little above it there shows itself
a <span lang="hbo-Latn">n&#275;tzer</span>, <i>i.e.,</i> a fresh, green shoot. In the historical
account of the fulfilment, even the ring
of the words of the prophecy is noticed: the
<span lang="hbo-Latn">n&#275;tzer,</span> at first so humble and insignificant,
was a poor despised <i>Nazarene</i> (Matt. ii.&nbsp;23).&mdash;<i>Delitzsch.</i></p></div>

<h3 class="tdc" id="o174"><span class="smcap">The Spirit of the Lord.</span></h3>

<p class="bq">xi.&nbsp;2. <i>The Spirit of the Lord shall rest upon Him.</i></p>

<p>This is declared concerning the
Messiah. Short as this declaration is,
some of the profoundest of all truths
are involved in it. It is implied that
God is a person, that from Him there
goes forth an influence by which the
character of other persons is affected,
and that all that qualified Jesus of
Nazareth to be the Messiah came
from God. Let us think of these
things. Do not be deterred from
doing so by the idea that they are
transcendental, far away from our
daily life. They need not be so; we
shall be very blameworthy if we
make them so.</p>

<p><b>I. God is a person.</b> There are
those who would have us put away
this faith. In their view, God is
merely the great controlling Force
behind all other forces, the life of
the universe, diffused throughout it, manifesting
itself in innumerable forms.
As it is the same life in the tree that
manifests itself in root, trunk, branch,
spray, twig, leaf, blossom, fruit, so all
things that exist are not the creations
of a personal will, but the manifestations
of an impersonal and all-pervading
life; all forces, convertible the
one into the other, are but varying
forms of the one underlying force.
Every individual life is but a wave
that seems for a moment to be separated
from the one universal ocean of
life; it leaps up from it, falls back into
it, is absorbed by it. True, these waves
are often strangely diverse&mdash;Nero and
St. Paul, John Howard and Napoleon,
the Virgin Mary and Lucrezia Borgia;
but in that great Unity of which they
are all manifestations, there is an all-comprehensive
reconciliation, though it
may elude our grasp. For Pantheism,
many would have us put away the
doctrine of a personal God. But this
exchange, if it could be forced upon us
by some logical necessity (which it is
not), would not be a gain, but a tremendous
loss. For, 1.&nbsp;<i>There would be
a tremendous loss to the heart.</i> A force
may be feared, but not loved. To
gravitation we owe much, but no one
ever professed to love it. A force
cannot be loved, because it does not
love. Strike out of our life all that
comes to us from the confidence that
God loves us, and from the responsive
love that springs up in our hearts
towards Him, and how much is lost!
Then there is no longer any assurance
amid the mysteries of life, nor consolation
in its sorrows. In a word,
we are orphaned: we can no longer
say, &ldquo;Our Father, who art in heaven.&rdquo;
There is no longer a Father, knowing
us, loving us, causing all good things to
work together for our good; there is
only a Force, to which it is useless to
appeal, against which it is impossible
to contend. 2.&nbsp;<i>We should also lose one
of the greatest of all helps to a noble life.</i>
Not to dwell on the fact that to speak
of virtue or vice would then be absurd,&mdash;then
<span class="pagenum" id="p213">[p.&nbsp;213]</span>
we should no longer sin, we
should merely make mistakes,&mdash;consider
how much the world owes to the
aspiration to be like God which has
stirred so many noble souls. Through
them the average morality of the world
has been marvellously raised; but this
would have been impossible but for
the stimulus these inspiring souls found
in the character of God. That is the
first fact of which this text reminds
us, that God is a person from whom
a spirit&mdash;an influence&mdash;can go forth
affecting the character of other persons.</p>

<p><b>II. From God such an influence
does go forth.</b> The possibility is a
glorious fact. That from God a
&ldquo;spirit&rdquo; should go forth, and that it
should do so invisibly, is in accordance
with all that we know of the universe
which God has made, and which is
in some sort a revelation of Him.
1.&nbsp;Nothing in the universe is unrelated.
From orb to orb influences go forth by
which they are mutually affected.
2.&nbsp;The mightiest influences are invisible.
In all this, the material is a counter-fact
and revelation of the spiritual. It
would be altogether abnormal, if from
God there did not go forth an influence
operating upon and affecting other
persons. It is invisible, but its effects
are recognisable. One of them is the
activity of conscience, rightly understood.
Another is the moral growth
and refinement which those in whom
it is most conspicuous, most invariably
and distinctly attribute to influences
exerted upon them by God. Even
Socrates did so. This also is a doctrine
full of hope and comfort. If we need
moral transformation, there streams
from God an influence capable of
effecting it: to that influence let us
submit ourselves, and the transformation
shall come to pass; the Spirit of
the Lord will rest upon us, and we
shall become like Him.</p>

<p><b>III. To the influence exerted upon
Him by the Spirit of the Lord, Jesus of
Nazareth owed all that qualified Him
to be the Messiah</b> (vers. 2&ndash;5). That
which was born of the Virgin Mary
was a true human child. A sinless
child, yet sinless not as the result
of the sinlessness of the mother (as
Rome teaches), but of the influence
of the Spirit of the Lord resting upon
Him from the beginning of his earthly
life. His was a real humanity&mdash;<i>our</i>
humanity sanctified. All that was
pure, noble, Godlike in Him was
&ldquo;born not of the flesh, nor of the will
of man, but of God.&rdquo; How full of
comfort and hope is this truth also!
To us also is offered the same Spirit.
Nothing can be more express than the
declarations that we may have it if we
will, and that, if we have it, the ultimate
result will be that we shall be
found partakers of the holiness of God.
Let us not be unwisely cast down by
the frailty and pollution of our nature;
if the Spirit of the Lord rest upon us,
the purity and the strength of God
will become ours, and at length the
Father will say to each of us, as He
did of Jesus of Nazareth, &ldquo;This is
My beloved Son, in whom I am well
pleased.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 class="tdc" id="o175"><span class="smcap">The Righteous Judge.</span></h3>

<p class="bq">xi.&nbsp;3. <i>And He shall not judge after the sight of His eyes, neither reprove after the
hearing of His ears.</i></p>

<p>A glorious difference between our
Lord and ourselves. &ldquo;He knew what
was in man,&rdquo; and needed not the
evidence of external signs, which often
mislead <i>us.</i> He should deal with the
motives of the heart (H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I., 3332,
4147). Not by human sight, but by
Divine <i>insight,</i> He judged the conduct
and character of men. 1.&nbsp;Our judgment
is enfeebled by <i>ignorance.</i> We
do not see and hear all, and from
our imperfect knowledge of facts we
draw wrong and often disastrous conclusions
(H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I., 2997&ndash;3005). But
Our Lord could go behind the visible
works, and detect what often deceived
men&mdash;<i>e.g.,</i> His treatment of pharisaism.
2.&nbsp;Our judgment is enfeebled
<span class="pagenum" id="p214">[p.&nbsp;214]</span>
by <i>prejudice.</i> This is often the result
of ignorance. Seeing only certain sides
of men, we dislike them, and frame our
judgments accordingly&mdash;<i>e.g.,</i> Nathanael
(John i.&nbsp;46). With no better reason
than Nathanael had, we regard many
a man as an enemy, or otherwise place
him in a false light. But our Lord
dealt with none in this way. Seeing
men as they really were, no preconceived
opinions led Him to unworthy
conclusions. 3.&nbsp;<i>Partiality</i> enfeebles and
perverts our judgment. Judging by
sight and hearing, we approve of one
man more than another, because he
has certain artful or pleasing methods
for winning our favour: flattery, offers
of gain, &amp;c. (P.&nbsp;D., 1275, 1281, 1283).
But our Lord could not be won in this
way (Mark xii.&nbsp;14; John vi.&nbsp;15). He
was infinitely compassionate, tender,
forgiving, but no feeble partiality interfered
to prevent most righteous
judgment. 4.&nbsp;Our judgment is often
perverted by <i>passion.</i> In the pursuit
of some unlawful and all-absorbing
aim, we become too disturbed to weigh
calmly even the evidences we can see
and hear. We look at everything in
the light of our false affection, and are
thereby rendered absolutely incapable
of beholding others in their true light,
especially if they stand in our way
and oppose our progress (P.&nbsp;D., 2060).
But the one absorbing and unremittent
purpose of Jesus of Nazareth was to
do the will of His Heavenly Father,
and to finish the work He had given
Him to do. Hence He dwelt always
on a pure altitude, in whose clear atmosphere
He saw men and things as
they are. 5.&nbsp;<i>Our natural depravity</i> is
also a serious hindrance to our right
judging. Our very organs of knowledge,
our affections, our conscience,
have been perverted. Let a man be
ever so disposed to take correct views
of men and things, there will be some
flaw in his vision, some defect in his
hearing. Hence there are times when
we cannot accept as final the judgment
of the best and holiest of men.
But Christ has no secret evil to lead
Him wrong.</p>

<p>In view of all this, how fitting it is
that Christ should be our judge! How
well, too, He is qualified to be the merciful
High Priest who we need (Heb.
iv.&nbsp;15, 16). He who tenderly sympathises
with us is He who perfectly knows
us (H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I., 956; P.&nbsp;D., 462).&mdash;<i>William Manning.</i></p>

<p class="tdc">(<i>Missionary Sermon.</i>)</p>

<p class="bq">xi.&nbsp;9. <i>They shall not hurt nor destroy, &amp;c.</i></p>

<p>We have here a picture of the golden
age. I.&nbsp;The whole earth shall be as
Mount Zion. II.&nbsp;Shall be freed from
injustice and violence. III.&nbsp;Shall be
filled with the knowledge of the Lord.
1.&nbsp;Wherein this knowledge consists.
2.&nbsp;To what extent it shall prevail&mdash;universal,
deep. 3.&nbsp;By what means it
is to be diffused.&mdash;<i>J. Lyth, D.D.: Homiletical
Treasury</i> (p. 18).</p>

<p class="gap" id="o176A">&ldquo;They shall not hurt nor destroy
in all my holy <i>mountain,</i> for the <i>earth</i>
shall be full of the knowledge of the
Lord.&rdquo; It seems clear that in these
words the prophet intended to be
understood of speaking of the whole
earth. He would scarcely, in the same
sentence, have used the expressions in
question&mdash;the <i>holy mountain</i> in the
first clause, and the <i>earth</i> in the other&mdash;if by
these expressions he had not meant
the same thing, namely, the whole globe
of the earth, when the dwellers thereon
should come to be true worshippers, like
those who first worshipped at Mount
Zion, and who were a type of the greater
assembly of worshippers, the holy and
universal Church, which in the fulness
of time would be established.</p>

<p>I. <i>The prophet grounds the hope of that
reformed and purified state of the moral</i>
<span class="pagenum" id="p215">[p.&nbsp;215]</span>
<i>world, described in the beautiful words
of the text, upon the increase of religious
knowledge</i> which he saw to be coming.
&ldquo;They shall not hurt&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. for the earth
shall be full of the <i>knowledge of the
Lord.</i>&rdquo; II.&nbsp;These words may be taken
as <i>descriptive of the legitimate effect of
Christian knowledge.</i> The general scope,
aim, and tendency of Gospel principles
is such as would produce the change
described, were it not counteracted by
the tendency within us to what is
wrong. III.&nbsp;They are more than this:
they are <i>prophetic of the actual results of
Christian knowledge.</i> The Gospel will
render war impossible. True, so-called
&ldquo;Christian&rdquo; nations have not yet
ceased to wage war with one another,
nor so-called &ldquo;Christian&rdquo; men to
rob and circumvent and ruin each
other. Nevertheless, this prophecy
shall yet be fulfilled. We see it in
the process of fulfilment. The condition
of the moral world has been
meliorated by Christianity. Wars
have not ceased, but their conduct
has been mitigated. In their private
dealings with each other, men have
become more just and trustworthy.
Already there are millions of men who
would shrink from doing harm of any
kind to their fellow-men. Compare
Christendom with heathendom, and
you will see what mighty changes the
Gospel has already wrought. The
practice even of Christian men falls
short of their knowledge. Nevertheless,
the practice and the morals of
men are, generally speaking, the best
where their knowledge is the most.
The prophet&rsquo;s words are justified by
fact, and men forbear one another most,
and hurt and destroy least, where
knowledge is the greatest. It is a fact
that life and property are more safe
and secure in the Christian portion of
the earth, than in any other portions.
And the knowledge of the Lord grows
year by year; partly through the
labours of missionaries in many places;
still more by the rapid growth of
the nations that are Christian. The
violent and lawless races of the earth
are dwindling away. The only races
that are increasing are those that fear
God, and are willing to respect the
rights, the properties, and the lives
of their neighbours. Through the
medium of this natural increase of
peace-loving races, and through the
conversion of many among the benighted
nations, this prophecy is
receiving a gradual, but very appreciable,
fulfilment. The world is advancing,
with ever-accelerating speed towards
knowledge and peace, and this
declaration shall yet be literally fulfilled
(H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I., 979, 1161&ndash;1168; P.&nbsp;D.,
2465, 2466).</p>

<p><i>Application.</i>&mdash;1.&nbsp;We are permitted to
rejoice in the hope of a period when
justice and benevolence shall prevail
in the world. 2.&nbsp;We are required to
contribute towards the realisation of
this hope. This we are to do (1)&nbsp;by
the purification of our own hearts;
by the conquest of every passion and
desire that would make us hurtful to
our neighbours. (2)&nbsp;By prayer (Matt.
vi.&nbsp;9, 10). (3)&nbsp;By helping to diffuse
that &ldquo;knowledge of the Lord&rdquo; which
is the great peace-maker in the earth.&mdash;<i>A. Gibson, M.A.:
Sermons on Various
Subjects; Second Series</i> (pp. 246&ndash;265).</p>

<p class="gap" id="o176B">In this and the preceding verses we
have a beautiful picture of a state of
human society entirely different from
anything that has been witnessed since
the Fall. The prophet beholds changes
in human character so great that he
feels he can only symbolise them by
transformations in the members of the
animal kingdom of the most astonishing
kind. Verses 6&ndash;8 <i>are</i> symbolical,
and are intended to excite within us
the liveliest anticipations of the glorious
effects that would follow the universal
proclamation and acceptation of
the gospel. Thus we are led to speak
of the nature, the diffusion, and the
effect of the knowledge of the Lord.</p>

<p>I. <span class="smcap">Its exalted nature.</span> By &ldquo;the
knowledge of the Lord&rdquo; may be meant
that of which He is the revealer (2&nbsp;Chron.
xxx.&nbsp;22), or that of which He

only be revealed by Himself; and He
has given us a threefold revelation of
Himself&mdash;in nature, in providence, and
<span class="pagenum" id="p216">[p.&nbsp;216]</span>
in Holy Scripture. In the latter we
have the record of the fullest revelation
which He has vouchsafed, that
given us in His Son. God is never
truly known by man until He is known
in Christ. &ldquo;The knowledge of the
Lord&rdquo; and &ldquo;the Gospel&rdquo; are terms
of the same meaning.</p>

<p>II. <span class="smcap">Its destined diffusion.</span> The
figure employed by the prophet brings
before us impressively the universality
of its diffusion. The imagination is
called in to instruct our
<span class="wsnw">faith.<a id="o176_fna1" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#o176_fn1">[1]</a></span>
The world-wide diffusion of the gospel
is a matter&mdash;1.&nbsp;Of <i>prophetic certainty.</i>
Nothing could be more plain than the
prophetic declarations concerning this
matter. But if any man asks <i>when</i>
the promise will be fulfilled, only one
answer can be given him (Acts i.&nbsp;7).
2.&nbsp;Involving <i>Divine agency.</i> Utterly
false is the notion that, after creating
the universe, God withdrew from it, and
left it to go on by its own momentum
(John v.&nbsp;17); and utterly false is the
notion that, after giving the gospel to
the world, God has left it to make its
own way therein. By Divine agency
men are raised up to proclaim it (Eph.
iv.&nbsp;11). While they are so engaged
Christ Himself is with them (Matt.
xxviii.&nbsp;20); and while they preach,
the Holy Spirit strives in the hearts
of men to prepare and dispose them to
receive the glad tidings (1&nbsp;Thess. i.&nbsp;5).
When, therefore, we look at the glorious
promise of our text, we must not forget
that God Himself is working for its
accomplishment. This will save us
from unbelief and despair concerning
it. 3.&nbsp;Involving <i>human instrumentality.</i>
Not that this is absolutely necessary.
Without human husbandry God could
have caused the earth to bring forth
food for man and beast, and without
human instrumentality He could have
saved the world. But it has pleased
Him to commit to us the Word of reconciliation.
The consequent duty of
preaching it must be taken in connection
with, and regarded as the condition
of, the promise; just as the promise
that there shall be a harvest till the
end of the world is conditioned by
man&rsquo;s sowing the seed in the appointed
season. The promise must not be used
as an excuse for indolence, but as a
stimulus to industry.</p>

<p>III. <span class="smcap">Its blessed effect.</span> The
Gospel is a harmonising power. It has
a transforming efficacy equal to any
that would be needed to bring about a
literal fulfilment of verses 6&ndash;8. Wherever
it comes in its saving power it new
creates human hearts, and thus dries
up the causes of hatred and discord at
their fountain. For it is a principle,
1.&nbsp;of <i>righteousness,</i> and 2.&nbsp;of <i>love.</i> Hence
it brings peace. For all discord is due
to injustice that is prompted by selfishness
(James iv.&nbsp;1). Where righteousness
and love combine and rule, there
must be peace and security; for the
very desire to injure is taken away.
The universal prevalence of the gospel
necessarily means universal peace (H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I.,
1120, 1127, 1129).</p>

<p>1. This suggests the answer to the
questions, Why Christian nations make
war against each other, and why even
in Christian churches there are fierce
contentions? The answer is, either
that those nations or churches are
Christian only in name, or that they
have only very partially attained to
&ldquo;the knowledge of the Lord.&rdquo; They
are only in infant-class in Christ&rsquo;s
great school; as they learn of Him,
their rivalries and hatreds will pass
away. 2.&nbsp;The Gospel being so blessed
in its effects, it is plain that it is the
duty of all good men to extend the
knowledge of it.&mdash;<i>John Rawlinson.</i></p>

<p class="gap" id="o176C">A remarkable declaration this,
especially if the Hebrew prophets
were, as some learned sceptics tell us,
men of narrow mind, worshipping a
merely local god, and hating all men
not descended from Jacob. By the
noble simile employed by Isaiah two
ideas are suggested&mdash;1.&nbsp;<i>Universality.</i>
mankind is the area to be covered.
2.&nbsp;<i>Ease.</i> All the creeks, bays, channels,
and broad highways of the vast ocean
are filled in their appointed time. The
mighty tide rises, sweeps onward, and
the work is done. There was one
great flood-tide of gospel-truth in the
days of the apostles, and there is a
<span class="pagenum" id="p217">[p.&nbsp;217]</span>
greater still to come. Meanwhile,
many difficulties attend the efforts of
God&rsquo;s people to extend the knowledge
of His truth; but, in the world&rsquo;s fulness,
great ease will characterise the progress
and triumphs of the gospel (Ps.
cx.&nbsp;3; Heb. viii.&nbsp;11). This declaration
suggests two great subjects:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. <span class="smcap">The hope of the world.</span> Shut
the Bible, and our outlook on the world
and its future is dark and sad. Open
it, and let its light shine into our
minds, and with the light will come
encouragement and hope. 1.&nbsp;If it is
true that &ldquo;the earth&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. the sea,&rdquo;
then God takes an interest in the affairs
of the world, and takes an interest in
them <i>now.</i> This mighty world is not
left to drift into an unknown and
perilous future without a steersman
to guide it. 2.&nbsp;If God makes such
abundant provision for the instruction
of men in the knowledge of Himself,
then He will be accessible to them
when, by that knowledge, they are led
to approach Him; and He is accessible
to us. 3.&nbsp;Himself opening for men a
way of access to Him, we may be sure
that when they avail themselves of it
He will deal with them in the way of
mercy and love; and so He will deal
with us. Who can doubt this who
looks on the fact of Christ, through
whom God has given us the truest
knowledge of Himself (2&nbsp;Cor. iv.&nbsp;6)?
4.&nbsp;He means to be known to the
<i>world,</i> and therefore His gracious offers
extend to <i>all,</i> to us.</p>

<p>II. <span class="smcap">The duty of the church.</span> In
view of this declaration, 1.&nbsp;<i>Take
enlarged views of your work.</i> Think how
much remains to be done. Even if
you could suppose that your family,
your street, your town, your country
were filled with the blessed tide of the
knowledge of the Lord, yet think of
the <i>earth,</i> and all its myriad claims
resting upon the servants of God.
2.&nbsp;<i>Spare no efforts in promoting the
cause of Christian missions.</i> In advancing
these, you are working in harmony
with the great purposes of God,
and for an object which is dear to
Him&mdash;that object for which He has
already given His Son! Will you
withhold from it the money with
which He has entrusted you, and for
which you will have to give account
at the last day? 3.&nbsp;There are many
present difficulties in the prosecution
of mission-work, but meanwhile <i>take
comfort from the large purposes of God.</i>
&ldquo;Have faith in God.&rdquo; His plans are
vast, but His glorious promises are
great as His counsels, and His resources
as glorious as His promises.
The process of filling the earth with
&ldquo;the knowledge of the Lord&rdquo; may seem
to us to be tedious, the obstacles may
be many, the time may be long; if the
work were left to us, it would be
hopeless; but <span class="smcap">God</span> will hasten it all in
His time.&mdash;<i>William Manning.</i></p>

<p class="gap" id="o176D">It is here declared that there is yet
to dawn upon the world an era of perfect
light, and that that shall be also
and therefore an era of perfect love.
&ldquo;They shall not hurt nor destroy in all
My holy mountain, <span class="smcap">for</span> the earth shall
be full of the knowledge of the Lord.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It is a mystery, but it is a fact, that
knowledge is not necessarily a blessing.
The devils believe&mdash;and therefore
know&mdash;yet remain devils still
(Jas. ii.&nbsp;19). Many men of unholy
life have been men of eminent knowledge
(Rom. i.&nbsp;21). But this is a
moral monstrosity, a result of the unnatural
condition into which we have
been brought by sin; just as in certain
forms of disease food becomes poison.
Knowledge is one of those forces which
naturally tend to elevate and sanctify
(H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I., 3106); to know God truly
is eternal life (John xvii.&nbsp;3); and the
declaration is, that knowledge shall
be world-wide, and that by it the
world shall be morally revolutionised.
Remembrance of two facts will give
intelligence and strength to our faith
in these glorious predictions. 1.&nbsp;<i>As
man&rsquo;s knowledge of God has grown, the
human race has risen.</i> Except in those
abnormal cases already referred to, it
may be declared that man cannot
learn to know God and remain as
they were&mdash;<i>e.g.,</i> wherever the knowledge
of the unity of God is restored
to man, idolatry becomes impossible;
<span class="pagenum" id="p218">[p.&nbsp;218]</span>
as soon as the knowledge of the
spirituality of God really enters the
mind, formalism in worship becomes
an impossibility. So every truth concerning
God, as soon as it is really
known, becomes a correcting and converting
force. The tendency of this
knowledge, as of light, is to quicken
and beautify. The way to grow in
grace is to grow in the knowledge of
Christ (2&nbsp;Pet. iii.&nbsp;18). 2.&nbsp;<i>The knowledge
of God is a thing that grows, and
grows slowly, in the human soul.</i> This is
true of all <span class="wsnw">knowledge.<a id="o176_fna2" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#o176_fn2">[2]</a></span>
But in proportion as it grows, sanctification takes
place in the individual life, reformation
in the national <span class="wsnw">life.<a id="o176_fna3" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#o176_fn3">[3]</a></span>
It is the most radical and successful of all revolutionists.
It is impossible for us to
dream of the changes it will accomplish
upon the earth. But this we know,
that by it war and every form of
violence shall be abolished (text;
Isa. ii.&nbsp;4, &amp;c.)</p>

<p>In this subject there is, 1.&nbsp;<i>A complete
justification of all missionary enterprises.</i>
They are not visionary schemes
foredoomed to failure; they are intensely
practical, and shall be triumphantly
successful. The time may be
far off, but it is advancing, when
every man shall know <span class="wsnw">God.<a id="o176_fna4" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#o176_fn4">[4]</a></span>
The effect of that knowledge will be the
destruction of the desire to destroy
or injure. 2.&nbsp;<i>An argument for patience.</i>
In view of the wrongs that prevail upon
the earth, many noble souls find it difficult
to exercise it. Of finer taste, of
clearer vision, of truer sympathy with
God than is common amongst men,
the wickedness that triumphs in the
world fills them with continual agony.
It drives them almost into atheism.
They ask, &ldquo;Can God see these things,
and not use His power to bring them
to an end? If there were a God,
would He not instantly smite the
oppressors with destruction?&rdquo; Let
them be patient. God does see; God
does feel; God is hastening on the
better day by the only means by which
it can really be brought in. Another
deluge would not cleanse the world
from crime; if but eight souls were
spared, sin would once more begin to
prevail. The era of purity and peace
can be ushered in only by the revelation
of God to man, and thus it is
advancing towards us; thus it is already
begun; between Christian and
heathen lands there is a real contrast;
and ere long there shall be as great a
contrast between Christian lands uplifted
by a fuller knowledge of God
and these lands as they now are. The
millennium is not merely a prophetic
dream, it shall be a glorious fact.
Patience! (H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I., 1134, 1135, 1166&ndash;1168,
3421&ndash;3423; P.&nbsp;D., 2465, 2466).
3.&nbsp;<i>An argument for hopeful Christian
effort.</i> We must not merely dream of
the millennium, we must labour to hasten
its dawn. Work is needful: Sunday-school
work, &amp;c. Every one who
prays, &ldquo;Thy kingdom come,&rdquo; thereby
unless he means to mock God, pledges
himself to work to hasten its coming,
and thus to be a &ldquo;fellow-labourer with
God.&rdquo; There is need for individual
effort, and for united effort. Such
effort should always be hopeful. We
are not attempting what is impossible;
we are working in the line of God&rsquo;s
promises, and with God! Remembering
that the sense of our own weakness
will not unduly depress us. It
does not require a giant&rsquo;s strength to
row with the tide; and a mightier
force than that of ocean is bearing us
on to a victory that shall fill earth
with blessing and heaven with gladness.</p>

&ldquo;The earth shall be full of the knowledge
of the Lord, <i>as the waters cover the sea.</i>&rdquo;
The expression is remarkable for its force.
In looking over the face of the ocean, no differences
are to be perceived: one part is not
fuller than the other; one part is not covered,
and another left dry; but all is one unbroken
stream, filling and covering the whole. So
shall it be with the Word of God among men.
It shall not be known to some, and hidden
from others. It shall not be fully declared
in one place, and only partially set forth in
another. Whatever knowledge it pleased Him
to give at all, shall be given to all men equally
and without distinction. Such is clearly the
purpose of God in His own appointed time.&mdash;<i>W.&nbsp;H. Sulivan.</i></p>

<p><i>&ldquo;As the waters cover the sea.&rdquo;</i> The idea of
universality could scarcely have been better
expressed than by this magnificent simile.
You have looked forth on the illimitable
expanse of waters with wonder and awe.
<span class="pagenum" id="p219">[p.&nbsp;219]</span>
Your imagination has followed the depths far
beyond the lowest tide-line to the unfathomed
valleys and caverns that form the ocean bed;
and you have endeavoured to take fully into
your mind the thought that the lowest depths
and the most distant shores were filled and
covered by the all-diffusive and all-searching
element.&mdash;<i>Rawlinson.</i></p></div>

<div class="footnote" id="o176_fn2"><p><a href="#o176_fna2"><span class="label">[2]</span></a>
The knowledge of God comes into the
soul as a king is born into a country over
which he is ultimately to rule; at the beginning
it is but a babe; for a long time it is
weak, and needs to be defended and nurtured;
many years elapse before it rules; rarely in
this life does it exercise full power and undisputed
sway.</p></div>

<div class="footnote" id="o176_fn3"><p><a href="#o176_fna3"><span class="label">[3]</span></a>
Many evils continue to exist and flourish
even in Christian lands, because their contrariety
to the character of God has not yet
been apprehended and felt. Many godly men
were slave-holders and slave-dealers, because
they did not fully know God. But now the
knowledge of God has so grown among men,
that it is no longer possible in a Christian
land for a godly man to be a slave-holder. So
with polygamy, which was once practised
without scruple by some of the noblest and
most devout men who ever lived. This practice
has been killed, not by any express prohibition,
but by growth among men of the
knowledge of God. That knowledge is predestined
still further to grow, and to kill
many things more.</p></div>

<h3 class="tdc" id="o177"><span class="smcap">The Ensign of the Nations.</span></h3>

<p class="bq">xi.&nbsp;10. <i>And in that day there shall be, &amp;c.</i></p>

<p>I. In the two parts of this verse we
have a twofold metaphorical representation
of the Redeemer: one expressed,
one implied. 1.&nbsp;<b>An ensign of the people</b>
= banner or standard, such as is set up
as a rallying-point around which,
(1)&nbsp;the subjects of a king assemble to do
him homage; and (2)&nbsp;the soldiers of an
army gather to receive the commands
and exhortations of their general.
2.&nbsp;This second use of a standard leads
to the second metaphorical representation
of the Redeemer, that of a
<b>victorious general:</b> &ldquo;His rest shall
be glorious.&rdquo; We are thus directed
to the final result of the uplifting of
Christ as an ensign: the great campaign
brought to a successful conclusion,
the Victor in it rests gloriously, surrounded
by the soldiers whom He has
led on to triumph, and the people to
whom He has given liberty and peace.</p>

<p>II. Consider how these predictions
have been fulfilled. 1.&nbsp;By the preaching
of the gospel Christ has been lifted
up, and as the result men of all nations
have sought unto Him, and will seek
Him more and more. 2.&nbsp;Having done
and suffered all that was necessary
ultimately to secure the final victory,
He has taken His place at the right
hand of the Majesty on high, and
rests there gloriously; the glory of
His rest arising from the number of
the subjects who do Him homage, and
of the soldiers who delight to fight
His battles, from the triumphs which
He has already enabled them to
achieve, and from the prosperity and
peace of all His people.</p>

<p>We shall make a great mistake if
we end by thus admiringly noting how
the ancient prophecy has been, and
is being, fulfilled in the history of the
world. <i>We</i> are among the Gentiles of
whom our text speaks: Have we sought
unto the glorious Person of whom it
speaks? You desire to do so. Do so,
then, 1.&nbsp;<i>For right purposes;</i> not merely
that you may be delivered from suffering,
but that you may be delivered
from sin; not merely that you may
ultimately gain admission to heaven,
but that you may have and now
render to Him the homage and the service
to which He is entitled. 2.&nbsp;<i>In a
right spirit;</i> not vainly dreaming that
you have, or can win, any claim upon
His regard, but recognising that you
can appeal only to His mercy, and that
without it you are lost; and making
this appeal penitently and believingly.
So coming to Him, He will be found
of you. He will cause you to share in
His rest, by causing you to share in
His triumphs; inspired and upheld by
Him, you shall trample under foot the
world, the flesh, the devil, and the
fear of death. Your whole being will
be at rest; your understanding no
longer harassed by perplexing doubts;
your conscience stilled and gladdened
by a righteous peace; your affections
<span class="pagenum" id="p220">[p.&nbsp;220]</span>
centred at last around Him who alone
is worthy of their supreme love; and
this threefold rest, so sweet and
blessed now, shall be perfected and
perpetuated in heaven.&mdash;<i>George Smith, D.D.</i></p>

<p class="gap" id="o177A">The prophet here foresees that the
Saviour&rsquo;s mission and work will so
exalt Him in the eyes of the nations,
that they will turn to Him as the one
object and desire of their souls. (Compare
John xii.&nbsp;32.) This prediction
declares that Christ would be a banner
to attract men, that He would be the
object of universal search, and that
men in finding Him would attain to
true rest and glory.</p>

<p>I. <span class="smcap">The banner.</span> 1.&nbsp;A banner is
naturally &ldquo;lifted up;&rdquo; only thus can
its purpose be accomplished (chap. xiii.&nbsp;2;
xviii.&nbsp;3). Apt image this of Christ.
Not merely in His death on Calvary.
That exaltation was followed by His
being lifted higher still by the preaching
of the gospel, by the ministry of the
Holy Spirit (John xvi.&nbsp;14), by the
devout lives of all His true followers.
2.&nbsp;A banner has usually some emblem
or device representative of some great
cause, or expressive of some great
truth. (Give instances.) So when
&ldquo;Christ and Him crucified&rdquo; are uplifted
clearly in the view of men, they see
God&rsquo;s hatred of sin, His love of man,
and His provision for man&rsquo;s future
happiness and glory.</p>

<p>II. <span class="smcap">The object of universal
search.</span> &ldquo;To it shall the Gentiles
seek.&rdquo; Search for Christ characterises
all races of men (Hag. ii.&nbsp;7) and all
periods of time (Luke x.&nbsp;24). The
search is often prosecuted in ignorance.
Men know not for what and for whom
their souls yearn; but it <i>is</i> Christ of
whom unconsciously they are in quest;
and it is towards Him, that by the else
insatiable desires of their spiritual
nature, they are being led.</p>

<p>III. <span class="smcap">The finding of true rest.</span>
&ldquo;His rest shall be glorious.&rdquo; 1.&nbsp;The
rest we find in Christ is connected with
a vital change effected in the heart and
life. He does not simply do something
<i>for</i> us; He also does a work <i>within</i> us.
Every intelligent seeker knows that
there can be no rest until the evil
that is lodged within us is resisted and
cast out (H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I., 1324). It is as we
enter into the spirit of Christ and
share His life, that we enter into rest
(Matt. xi.&nbsp;28&ndash;30). 2.&nbsp;Our new relations
to God, entered into by faith in Christ
Jesus, makes our rest very glorious.
God is then known to us by the most
precious and endearing names; He is
our rock, our shield, &amp;c. Each of these
names represents to us some tender
aspects of His love, some sweet ministry
of His grace.</p>

<p>Are you in search of the highest
peace, joy, holiness, rest? Here you
may end your quest (1&nbsp;Cor. i.&nbsp;30; P.&nbsp;D.,
481).&mdash;<i>William Manning.</i></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 class="tdc" id="o178"><span class="smcap">The Reconciler of Men.</span></h3>

<p class="bq">xi.&nbsp;10&ndash;16. <i>And in that day there shall be, &amp;c.</i></p>

<p>Several eminent commentators are
of opinion that this prophecy will not
be fulfilled until the Jews are restored
as a nation to their own land. Others
believe that the prophet used (it may
be unconsciously) transient geographical
phrases as symbols of eternal
truths. Without entering upon this
controversy, which can be settled only
by the actual unfolding and accomplishment
of God&rsquo;s plans as to the history
of this world, let us think of the fundamental
fact of the vision, that in it
&ldquo;the Root of David&rdquo; was revealed to
the prophet as <i>the reconciler of men.</i>
His appearing in the world would be the
setting up of a standard unto which
all men, Gentiles (ver. 10) and Jews
(vers. 11, 12), would seek; and before
the influence then exerted upon them
by Him rivalries and enmities, even
though they were as inveterate and
malignant as those of Judah and
Ephraim (ver. 13), would disappear.
No obstacles, even though they should
be as immense as the geographical ones
which are specified, would hinder their
coming together and forming one
<span class="pagenum" id="p221">[p.&nbsp;221]</span>
united and triumphant people under
His benignant sway. This is only
saying what the prophet has said
already (chap. ii.&nbsp;4; ix.&nbsp;7), that the
kingdom of Christ would be a kingdom
of peace. Consider&mdash;</p>

<p><b>I. How marvellously and gloriously
this prediction has been fulfilled.</b>
To appreciate this, we must recall the
condition of the world at the time
when &ldquo;the day&rdquo; of which our text
speaks dawned upon it. Nations were
everywhere divided from each other
by jealousies and hatreds as virulent
as those that divided Ephraim from
Judah; there was peace only because
they were restrained from active hostility
by the strong hand of Roman
power. Hatred of other nations was
regarded not as a crime, but as a
<span class="wsnw">duty.<a id="o178_fna1" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#o178_fn1">[1]</a></span>
But Christ inaugurated the
empire of universal brotherhood and
love. Wars have not yet ceased even
among nations professing Christianity,
but they are no longer openly gloried
in by those who wage them; they are
apologised for as sad necessities. The
apology is often insincere, but the fact
that it is made at all is a marvellous
tribute to the influence and authority
of Christ. Wherever His true followers
meet, national distinctions are forgotten,
and they feel drawn to each other by
a mightier and sweeter bond. As the
centuries pass away, the love of Christ
becomes more and more the uniting
power of the world.</p>

<p><b>II. How sadly imperfect the fulfilment
of this prediction still is!</b> The
era of universal peace has not yet
dawned. The world is still cursed by
wars and rumours of wars. Millions
of men are maintained in constant
readiness for war. There are bitter
contentions among the sections of the
Christian Church, these tribes of the
modern Israel. Class is divided from
class. So-called Christian families are
saddened by bitter feuds.</p>

<p><b>III. The blessedness of the era that
shall yet dawn upon the world.</b> The
Christian often dreams of it; his
dreams are sweet as those which hungry
men have of banquets, and shipwrecked
sailors drifting helplessly on rafts in
the wide ocean have of their native
village and of meeting with their loved
ones there; and in their waking hours
they, too, are apt to be saddened by the
fear that their dreams too are as utterly
incapable of realisation. But it is not
so. They shall all be realised, for the
authority of Christ shall yet be universal,
real, absolute; and all the listening
angels shall not be able to detect one
sound of discord rising from the round
world, for the whole world shall be
full of the peace of Christ (P.&nbsp;D., 2465,
2466, 2676).</p>

<p><b>IV. Our duty in regard to this prediction.</b>
We are not merely to dream
dreams of the blessedness of the era
that shall yet be ushered in. We are
to <i>do</i> something to hasten its dawning.
1.&nbsp;We are to pray for it with yearning
hearts. 2.&nbsp;We are to do our utmost,
in every possible way, to extend the
knowledge of the Gospel throughout
the world. The Gospel, not commerce,
is the true civiliser and uniter of
nations: commerce will prosper on the
Gospel triumphs. True, many converts
are only nominally Christians, but in
many cases that <i>is</i> the first step towards
their becoming real Christians, <i>i.e.,</i> men
who will pray and labour for universal
peace. 3.&nbsp;Minor and contributory
duties. (1.)&nbsp;The diffusion of knowledge
that will tend to bring home to
the understandings and hearts of men
the hurtfulness of war, and the preparation
for war. (2.)&nbsp;The discouragement
and overthrow of those statesmen, to
whichever party they may belong, whose
policy tends to foster national animosities.
(3.)&nbsp;The discouragement of all
pursuits and things that tend to familiarise
men with war and keep alive
in them a passion for it, <i>e.g.,</i> the volunteer
movement; pictures, poems, and
newspapers that glorify successful soldiers,
as if in them the noblest ideal
of manhood were realised. (4.)&nbsp;Careful
education of our children in Christian
sentiments concerning foreign
nations and war. By constant heedfulness
of these duties, we shall do
something to hasten the dawning of the
era of universal peace and blessedness,
and we shall not have lived in vain.</p>

&ldquo;Ancient morality was essentially national
and exclusive. Its creed was that a man is
born not for himself, but for his parents, his
family, and the state. The state was surrounded
by others with which, unless some
treaty had been concluded, it was at war. To
do as much good as possible to one&rsquo;s own state,

<p class="bq">xii.&nbsp;1. <i>And in that day thou shalt say, O Lord, &amp;c.</i></p>

<p>This prophecy is said by some to
relate to the invasion by Sennacherib,
and the marvellous deliverance therefrom.
If so, it is an instance of sanctified
affliction, and a lesson to us that
whenever we smart under the rod we
may look forward to the time when
it shall be withdrawn; it is also an
admonition to us, that when we escape
from trial we should take care to celebrate
the event with grateful praise.
It is thought by others that the text
mainly relates to the latter days, and
I think it would be impossible to read
the eleventh chapter without feeling
such a reference is clear. Both these
interpretations are true and instructive;
but we shall find out the very
soul of the passage, if we consider it
as an illustration of what occurs to
every one of God&rsquo;s people when he
is brought out of darkness into God&rsquo;s
marvellous light, when he is delivered
from the spirit of bondage beneath
Divine wrath, and led by the Spirit
of adoption into the liberty wherewith
Christ makes him free. In regarding
the text from this point of view,
we shall first observe the prelude of
this delightful song, and then listen
to the song itself.</p>

<p>I. <span class="smcap">The prelude of this charming
song</span>&mdash;&ldquo;In that day thou shalt say.&rdquo;
Here we have the tuning of the harps,
the notes of the music follow after
in the succeeding sentences. Note,
1.&nbsp;There is a <i>time</i> for the joyous song
here recorded, &ldquo;In that day&rdquo;&mdash;the day
of the manifestation of the Divine
power. 2.&nbsp;One word indicates the
<i>singer.</i> &ldquo;<i>Thou</i> shalt say.&rdquo; One by
one we receive eternal life and peace.
Religion is an individual matter. The
word &ldquo;thou&rdquo; is spoken to those
brought down into the last degree of
despair. Thou broken-hearted sinner,
ready to destroy thyself because of the
anguish of conscience, in the day of
God&rsquo;s abounding mercy, <i>thou</i> shalt
rejoice! 3.&nbsp;The <i>Teacher</i> of the song.
&ldquo;In that day thou <i>shalt</i> say.&rdquo; Who
but the Lord can thus command man&rsquo;s
heart and speech? 4.&nbsp;The <i>tone</i> of the
song. &ldquo;Thou shalt <i>say.</i>&rdquo; The song
is to be an open one, vocally uttered,
heard of men. It is not to be a silent
feeling, a kind of soft music whose
sweetness is spent within the spirit;
but in that day thou shalt testify and
bear witness what the Lord has done
for thee (H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I., 3903&ndash;3921).</p>

<p>II. <span class="smcap">The song itself.</span>&mdash;1.&nbsp;All of
it is concerning the Lord; it is all
addressed to Him. &ldquo;O Lord, I will
praise <i>Thee:</i> though <i>Thou</i> wast angry
with me, <i>Thine</i> anger is turned away.&rdquo;
When a soul is escaped from the bondage
of sin, it resembles the apostles
on Mount Tabor&mdash;it sees no man but
Jesus only. 2.&nbsp;It includes repentant
memories. The Hebrew would run
something like this, &ldquo;O Lord, I will
praise Thee; Thou wast angry with
me.&rdquo; We do this day praise God
because He made us feel His anger.
&ldquo;What, is a sense of anger a cause for
praise?&rdquo; No, not if it stood alone,
but because it has driven us to Christ.
The song in its deep bass includes
plaintive recollections of sin pressing
heavily on the spirit. 3.&nbsp;It contains
blessed certainties. &ldquo;Thine anger <i>is</i>
turned away.&rdquo; &ldquo;Can a man know
that? Can he be quite sure he is
forgiven?&rdquo; He can be as sure of
pardon as he is of his existence, as
infallibly certain as he is of a mathematical
proposition. The Scriptures
teach that to the sinner who trusts in
Jesus there is no condemnation, and
<span class="pagenum" id="p223">[p.&nbsp;223]</span>
every one may know whether he is
trusting in Jesus or not (H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I., 309,
310, 324&ndash;334, 986, 989). 4.&nbsp;It includes
holy resolutions. &ldquo;I will praise Thee&rdquo;&mdash;in
secret, in public. For this purpose
I will unite with Thy people. I
will not be content unless all that I am
and all that I have shall praise Thee.
5.&nbsp;It is a song which is peculiar in its
characteristics, and appropriate only
to the people of God. It is a song of
strong faith, and yet of humility. Its
spirit is a precious incense made up
of many costly ingredients. Humility
confesses, &ldquo;Thou wast angry with
me;&rdquo; gratitude sings, &ldquo;Thine anger is
turned away;&rdquo; patience cries, &ldquo;Thou
comfortest me,&rdquo; and holy joy springs
up, and saith, &ldquo;I will praise Thee.&rdquo;
Faith, hope, love&mdash;all have their notes
here, from the bass of humility up to
the highest alto of glorious communion.</p>

<p>By way of practical results from this
subject, let me speak, 1.&nbsp;A word of <i>consolation</i>
to those who are under God&rsquo;s
anger. God never shut up a soul in
the prison of conviction, but sooner
or later He released the captive. The
worst thing in the world is to go
unchastised; to be allowed to sin and
eat honey with it, this is the precursor
of damnation; but to sin, and to have
the wormwood of repentance with it,
this is the prelude of being saved. If
the Lord has embittered thy sin, He
has designs of love towards thee; His
anger shall yet be turned away.
2.&nbsp;A word of <i>admonition.</i> Some of you
have been forgiven, but are you praising
God as you should? (H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I., 3903&ndash;3911).&mdash;<i>C.&nbsp;H. Spurgeon:
Metropolitan Tabernacle Pulpit</i> (vol. xvi. pp. 241&ndash;250).</p>

<p class="gap" id="o179A">The preceding chapter relates to the
reign of the Messiah; the end of it
especially to the ingathering of the
Jews&mdash;a period which will be the spiritual
jubilee to the tribes of Israel,
and the beginning of the millennium
to the world itself. <i>That</i> is the day
in which Israel shall say, &ldquo;O Lord,
I will praise thee,&rdquo; &amp;c. This passage
may be applied to every spiritual
child of Abraham. Consider&mdash;</p>

<p><b>I. The previous state referred to.</b>
&ldquo;Thou wast angry with me.&rdquo; Anger
in God is not, as it often is in us,
a blind, furious passion; but a holy
disapprobation of wrong, and a righteous
determination to punish it (H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I.,
2288&ndash;2294). 1.&nbsp;<i>Man&rsquo;s character
and conduct, while in his natural state,
are such as justly expose him to the
Divine anger.</i> What does God survey
in the sinner? Ignorance, unbelief,
envy, malevolence, impurity,
&amp;c. In his conduct, likewise, how
much there is that must necessarily be
displeasing to God!&mdash;ingratitude, disobedience,
selfishness, abuse of long-suffering,
the rejection of Christ.
2.&nbsp;<i>No intelligent being need be in any doubt
as to whether he is, or is not, an object of the
Divine anger.</i> The teaching of Scripture
is clear (Ps. vii.&nbsp;11; xxxiv.&nbsp;16,
&amp;c.) This is ratified by the workings
of conscience. Let any one do good
secretly, and contrast his state of mind
with the feelings arising after the commission
of secret evil. 3.&nbsp;<i>The Divine
anger is of all things to be deprecated.</i> Remember
what its effects have been upon
impenitent sinners. Think of the old
world; of Pharaoh and the Egyptians;
of Sodom, &amp;c. View the written in
indelible and awful characters in the
history of the Israelites. Nothing can
resist it, alleviate it, or deliver from it.</p>

<p><b>II. The delightful change experienced.</b>
1.&nbsp;<i>The Divine displeasure is
removed.</i> &ldquo;Anger turned away.&rdquo; The
cloud blotted out; no longer under
condemnation, &amp;c. This necessarily
supposes a change in the creature.
His enmity and opposition to God
have ceased; he has seen the evil of
sin; confessed and forsaken it; and
believed in the Lord Jesus Christ. A
state of unbelief exposes us to the
Divine wrath; a state of faith brings
upon us His favour. God abhors the
high and proud spirit; but He looks
in pity on the lowly and contrite.
2.&nbsp;<i>The Divine favour is enjoyed.</i> &ldquo;Thou
comfortest me.&rdquo; We cannot stand in
a neutral state with respect to God.
The instant His anger is removed, His
favour is enjoyed. Guilt, remorse,
the burden of sin, are gone; and in
their stead there is a sweet assurance
<span class="pagenum" id="p224">[p.&nbsp;224]</span>
of acceptance with God. This comfort
is real, not visionary; suitable,
abiding, and inexpressibly precious; it
is associated with all good, both in this
life and that which is to come; it is
the precursor of everlasting felicity.</p>

<p><b>III. The grateful return presented.</b>
&ldquo;I will praise Thee.&rdquo; Acceptable
praise, 1.&nbsp;<i>Includes the offering of a
thankful heart.</i> It must arise from
within; it must be the expression of
the affections of the soul. Heart gratitude
is alone real, and that which God
will receive. 2.&nbsp;It must be <i>free and
spontaneous.</i> &ldquo;I will.&rdquo; Not I ought,
or should, but &ldquo;I will.&rdquo; 3.&nbsp;It must
be <i>constant</i> (Eph. v.&nbsp;20; 1&nbsp;Thess. v.&nbsp;18;
Ps. xxxiv.&nbsp;1).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Application.</span>&mdash;Let the text be
1.&nbsp;<i>The test of our state.</i> Can we use it?
Is it so with us? Is God our reconciled
friend? 2.&nbsp;<i>The test of our spirit
and conduct.</i> Do we love and bless
God? Is it our delight to do so?
3.&nbsp;<i>Let it be attractive to the convicted,
mourning sinner.</i> There is a way to
Divine peace, and to real and heavenly
comfort. Christ is that way. Come now
to God through Him.&mdash;<i>Jabez Burns,
D.D.: Pulpit Cyclop&aelig;dia</i> (iii. 221&ndash;224).</p>

<p class="gap" id="o179B">In this verse we have a representation&mdash;<b>I.&nbsp;Of
the natural condition
of sinful men.</b> An object of Divine
anger. 1.&nbsp;The nature of the emotion
described; 2.&nbsp;The cause of this anger;
3.&nbsp;How much it is to be feared. Unlike

irresistible power. <b>II.&nbsp;Of the change
effected in the state of believers

<h3 class="tdc" id="o180"><span class="smcap">Wells of Salvation.</span></h3>

<p class="bq">xii.&nbsp;3. <i>Therefore with joy shall ye draw water out of the wells of salvation.</i></p>

<p>Salvation is the great theme of the
Bible, and thus it meets man&rsquo;s great
need. Think, I.&nbsp;Of <span class="smcap">the wells,</span> the
sources of salvation. Clearly these are
not found in man himself. Salvation
originated in the eternal love of God
for man; it flows to sinners through
the work of Jesus; it is by the influence
of the Holy Spirit that the
sinner is made willing to partake of it.
These truly are <i>wells</i> of salvation; not
rills that may dry up; not even rivers,
which may fail because the streams
from the mountains have failed; but
wells, fountains over-flowing, inexhaustible
as the nature of God.
II.&nbsp;Of <span class="smcap">the water.</span> A beautiful symbol
of a great reality. Excepting the air
we breathe, there is no element so
widely diffused, nor so essential to
life, as water. Imagine a great city,
a whole district, a ship&rsquo;s crew without
<span class="wsnw">water.<a id="o180_fna1" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#o180_fn1">[1]</a></span>
1.&nbsp;Water <i>revives.</i> How
the traveller dying from thirst begins
to revive the instant water touches
his lips; so the salvation of the gospel
imparts new life to the soul; an invigoration,
moreover, that shall not
pass away (John iv.&nbsp;14). 2.&nbsp;Water
<i>cleanses.</i> So does the salvation of the
gospel (Rev. i.&nbsp;5; Heb. ix.&nbsp;14; Ezek.
xxxvi.&nbsp;25; Zech. xiii.&nbsp;1). 3.&nbsp;Water
<i>fertilises.</i> The water of salvation enriches
and fertilises the spiritual soil,
so that the blossoms of hope in the
early spring-time of piety, and the
matured fruits of holiness in the
autumn of life, adorn the garden of the
<span class="pagenum" id="p225">[p.&nbsp;225]</span>
Lord (Isa. lviii.&nbsp;11; Jer. xxxi.&nbsp;12;
Ps. i.&nbsp;3; Num. xxiv.&nbsp;6). III.&nbsp;Of <span class="smcap">the
joy.</span> 1.&nbsp;This can only be experienced
by such as draw water out of the wells
of salvation. Necessarily it <i>is</i> a matter
of experience. There are many things
that must be felt to be known, and
this is one of them. 2.&nbsp;This joy may
be expected in the very act of drawing
the water of salvation. If you were
to overtake a traveller in a sandy
desert dying from thirst, he would
begin to enjoy the very moment he
became conscious of the touch of the
precious fluid. So with the Christian
(Rom. xv.&nbsp;13). And as he may and
ought to be constantly drawing from
the wells of salvation, his life should
always be a happy life (H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I. 3037&ndash;3051;
P.&nbsp;D. 2085).</p>

<p>Our text may be regarded&mdash;1.&nbsp;As
giving full permission to do that of
which it speaks. However unworthy
we may be, we may come to the wells
of salvation, and draw as much as we
need (Rev. xxii.&nbsp;17; H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I., 2331,
2361, 2362, 4086). 2.&nbsp;Nay, as a
command. When a sovereign prepares
a banquet, and issues his invitations,
those invitations have the force of
commands. God has graciously provided
salvation for your souls in Christ:
will you turn away and despise His
love?&mdash;<i>John Rawlinson.</i></p>

<p class="gap" id="o180A">Salvation&mdash;let us not think of it
meanly. It has past, present, future
aspects. Too often we content ourselves
with the <i>past</i> view of it, and
that in a selfish way. Twenty or
thirty years ago, we &ldquo;believed&rdquo; and
were &ldquo;saved,&rdquo; <i>i.e.,</i> got out of harm&rsquo;s
way. What is God&rsquo;s grace <i>doing</i> for
us? Is it making us purer, nobler?
And what are our <i>aspirations</i> and <i>prospects?</i>
Are we imitators of the great
Apostle? (Phil. iii.&nbsp;13, 14).</p>

<p>This comprehensive and glorious
salvation, what is its source? Whence
is it to be drawn? From <span class="smcap">God.</span> &ldquo;Behold,
<i>God</i> is my salvation.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Therefore,&rdquo;
&amp;c. The third verse must never
be separated in thought from the
second, &ldquo;With Thee is the fountain of
life&rdquo;&mdash;with God as revealed to us in
Christ. This is the claim of Christ
Himself (John vii.&nbsp;37, <span class="wsnw">38).<a id="o180_fna2" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#o180_fn2">[2]</a></span>
He stands over against all the ignorance,
the guilt, the pollution, and the deathfulness
of man, as the infinite Fulness
(1&nbsp;Cor. i.&nbsp;30; Col. i.&nbsp;19; John i.&nbsp;16;
H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I., 934&ndash;941). As the wells of
salvation are in Him; and from Him
His people draw the priceless &ldquo;water&rdquo;
with joy. This is a duty, but it is
performed by them as freely and
spontaneously as on a summer morning
the birds fill the air with music.
They do so&mdash;1.&nbsp;<i>Because the wells of
salvation are free to all, and easily accessible
by all.</i> Were it not so, we might
fear that we or our friends were
excluded therefrom. But God&rsquo;s salvation,
like all His best gifts&mdash;air,
light, water&mdash;is free to all alike (H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I.,
942, 943, 2331, 2361, 2362).
And it is easily accessible; not harder
terms are imposed upon us than it is
possible and right for us to comply
with. (All this is summed up in chap.
lv.&nbsp;1.) 2.&nbsp;<i>Because &ldquo;the wells of salvation&rdquo;
are inexhaustible.</i> Picture the
fainting and despairing condition of
a traveller who, in a time of scorching
heat, comes to a well, and finds it
empty. No such fate awaits the true
seeker after God. Other sources of
help will deceive and fail us (Jer. ii.&nbsp;13).
3.&nbsp;<i>Because of the deep satisfaction
which is derived therefrom</i> (John iv.&nbsp;14;
H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I., 968&ndash;971, 1658, 1659, 2738&ndash;2837,
4627&ndash;4630, 4790). 4.&nbsp;<i>Because
the fulness that thus becomes ours is a source
of blessing to others</i> (Gen. xii.&nbsp;2; xxxix.&nbsp;5;
Prov. xviii.&nbsp;4; Isa. lviii.&nbsp;11; Ezek.
xlvii.&nbsp;12; Zech. xiv.&nbsp;8; H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I.,
1740&ndash;<span class="wsnw">1743).<a id="o180_fna3" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#o180_fn3">[3]</a></span></p>

<p>Come to the Well-spring of life. It is
open to you all. Whosoever will may
come. Jesus stands ready to satisfy your
deepest longings.&mdash;<i>William Manning.</i></p>

<p class="gap" id="o180B">This chapter should be read in connection
with the preceding, which
determines its application to the times
of Messiah. The peaceful state of the
Church in Hezekiah&rsquo;s time is made the
emblem of the peaceful era of the
Gospel; as the Israelites who had
been carried away in various invasions
<span class="pagenum" id="p226">[p.&nbsp;226]</span>
thus returned to their own country, so
the nations should be gathered to the
standard of Christ (Isa. xi.&nbsp;10&ndash;16).</p>

<p><b>I. The sources of consolation which
God has opened up to the Church
in the revelation of His Son.</b> In a
dry and thirsty land like this&mdash;in a
world where there are so many sorrows
arising from sin, and so many difficulties
in our way to heaven&mdash;we need
sources of supply, fountains of consolation.
And in the Word of God we
have them; &ldquo;<i>wells</i> of salvation,&rdquo; not
running streams, not brooks, full in
spring and dry in summer, but wells!
1.&nbsp;Christ is the great fountain (John
vii.&nbsp;37, 38). When He was lifted up
upon the cross, the fountain of grace
that is in Him was opened, and healing
streams shall never cease to flow
from it, till the last weary pilgrim has
reached the abodes of blessedness. Do
we thirst for the pardon of sin? (Matt.
xii.&nbsp;31). For the favour and friendship
of God? (Matt. v.&nbsp;6). For solid
and spiritual happiness? (Isa lv.&nbsp;1;
Rev. xxii.&nbsp;17). 2.&nbsp;The religion of
Christ is a system of consolation and
joy; it is the only one that deserves
the name; all others work as with
unmeaning ceremonies or unfounded
expectations. All the parts of Christ&rsquo;s
religion, properly understood and personally
enjoyed, promote solid comfort
and true joy. Its doctrine (Rom. v.&nbsp;11).
Its promises (Ps. xcvii.&nbsp;11). Its
precepts (Ps. cxix.&nbsp;54). Its prospects
(Rom. v.&nbsp;2; H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I., 4161&ndash;4163).
3.&nbsp;God is &ldquo;the God of comfort.&rdquo; Christ
is &ldquo;the consolation of Israel.&rdquo; The
Holy Spirit is &ldquo;the Comforter.&rdquo; How
ample are the sources of comfort
and joy mentioned in this chapter!
(1.)&nbsp;The removal of a sense of Divine displeasure
(ver. 1). (2.)&nbsp;Hope of interest
in God&rsquo;s special favour as our covenant
God (ver. 2).</p>

<p><b>II. What is necessary to our personal
appropriation of these comforts
and</b> <span class="wsnw"><b>joys.</b><a id="o180_fna4" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#o180_fn4">[4]</a></span>
Many persons, who
appear to be disciples of Christ, are
without the satisfaction which the text
promises. They may be safe, but they
are not happy (H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I., 306&ndash;314). The
fault is not in the Gospel: the promise
is express, the provision is free, the
invitation is open. If the Christian
would know the joy of which the text
speaks, 1.&nbsp;<i>He must learn to set a higher
value upon spiritual blessings.</i> It is the
order of divine procedure to awaken
a high sense of the value of His gifts
before He communicates them. Many
seem indifferent whether they enjoy
the higher blessings of religion or no.
The saints in former times were more
earnest (Ps. xlii.&nbsp;1). 2.&nbsp;<i>He must
cultivate those graces of religion which
are immediately connected with its enjoyments:</i>
humility of mind, a teachable
spirit, a more spiritual order of
affections (Ps. xxv.&nbsp;9, 14; Col. iii.&nbsp;2;
Phil. iv.&nbsp;5&ndash;7). 3.&nbsp;<i>Especially he must cultivate
a prayerful spirit and expectant
dependence upon divine illumination.</i>
Prayer is the key that opens the
treasury of heaven (Ps. xxxiv.&nbsp;5; cxix.&nbsp;18).
Neglect of the Spirit&rsquo;s influences
is a frequent cause of degeneracy and
distress. 4.&nbsp;<i>He must avoid whatever
would hinder the life and power of religion:</i>
the secret love of sin, undue
attachment to the world, prevalence of
unholy tempers. It is a matter of
perfect impossibility that the comforts
of religion can be enjoyed where sin
and inconsistency prevail. Is there no
sin indulged, no self-dependence, no
conformity to the world, no neglect of
private duties? (Jer. ii.&nbsp;17, 18). Heaven
is a realm of perfect happiness,
because it is the realm of perfect holiness.
5.&nbsp;<i>He must diligently use all the
appointed means of grace.</i></p>

opened for the supply of human needs;</i>
not for God&rsquo;s benefit, but for ours.
What wells are to travellers through a
desert, these are to us in our pilgrimage
to Zion. II.&nbsp;<i>Men should come to these
wells for the purpose of having their needs
supplied;</i> not from habit, not that we
<span class="pagenum" id="p227">[p.&nbsp;227]</span>
may set a good example, &amp;c., but
that we ourselves may be refreshed and
strengthened. III.&nbsp;<i>No frequency in
coming to these wells can be in any sense
meritorious.</i> Expose the mistake of
the Pharisee and the Ritualist. The
oftener we avail ourselves of them, the
more we increase, not our claims upon
God, but our obligations to Him; and
the more should increase, not our pride
and self-righteousness, but our thankfulness
to God for His goodness in
providing them. IV.&nbsp;<i>The wells are
nothing: the water in them is everything.</i>
A dry well, however deep it may be,
or whatever historic associations may
cluster around it, is worthless; and so
are all religious ordinances apart from
the Spirit of God. We must ever
remember that they are <i>means</i> of grace&mdash;channels
through which the God of
all grace will satisfy the soul&rsquo;s thirst
of those who seek Him in sincerity and
truth. V.&nbsp;<i>Nevertheless we are not to
stay away from the wells, nor despise them.</i>
That is a false spirituality that disparages
divine ordinances. We are not
to trust in the wells, yet neither are we
to refuse to draw water out of them:&mdash;1.&nbsp;Because
<span class="smcap">God</span> opened them, and
to neglect them it to charge Him with
foolishly providing what we do not
need. 2.&nbsp;Because it pleases Him to
give us water through them; and we
are to accept the blessing in whatever
way He chooses to impart it to us.
Naaman (2&nbsp;Kings v.&nbsp;11&ndash;13); the
blind man (John ix.&nbsp;6, 7). 3.&nbsp;Because
we need refreshment and reinvigoration
day by day (Isa. xl.&nbsp;31; Ps. lxxxiv.&nbsp;7;
H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I., 555, 556, 3866&ndash;3876).
4.&nbsp;Because our Master in the days of His
flesh used the means of grace; no true
Christian will seek in this respect to
be above his Lord. VI.&nbsp;<i>God has opened</i>
<span class="smcap">wells</span> <i>of salvation;</i> not one, but many;
none needlessly. We must use them
all. Their benefit lies in their conjunction.
For the production of a harvest,
the sun and the rain are both needed;
the sun alone would make a desert,
the rain alone a swamp. No bird can
fly with <i>one</i> wing, &amp;c. We must read
as well as pray, &amp;c.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Concluding lessons.</span>&mdash;1.&nbsp;<i>Why
God sometimes leaves the wells dry.</i> His
people sometimes come so to delight in
the means of grace, that they forget
they are only <i>means,</i> and then He withholds
His blessings, that they may be
taught that He alone can satisfy their
souls (Ps. lxxxiv.&nbsp;2, lxii.&nbsp;5). 2.&nbsp;<i>Why,
when there is water in the wells, some are
not quickened and refreshed.</i> (1.)&nbsp;Water
revives the living, not the dead.
(2.)&nbsp;Some forget to bring their buckets.
They have no real desires after God,
not true faith in His power and willingness
to bless them, and to each of them
we may say, &ldquo;Sir, thou hast nothing
to draw with, and the wells are deep&rdquo;
(John iv.&nbsp;11).</p>

The Talmudists refer the words, &ldquo;With
joy shall ye draw water out of the wells of salvation,&rdquo;
to the custom of making an oblation
of water on the last day of the Feast of Tabernacles,
when a priest fetched water in a golden
pitcher from the fountain of Siloah, and
poured it mixed with wine on the morning
sacrifice as it lay on the altar; while at the
evening offering the same was done amidst
shouts of joy from the assembled people. It
was in obvious allusion to this rite that, &ldquo;in
the last day, that great day of the feast, Jesus
stood and cried, saying, If any man thirst, let
him come unto Me and drink;&rdquo; but as it is
not prescribed in the law of Moses, it has been
doubted whether it dates back earlier than the
times of the Maccabees. It is, however, at least
as probable that the Asmonean princes should
have restored an ancient as ordained a new
rite: such a rite, to acknowledge God&rsquo;s gift
of water without which harvest and vintage
must have failed, would always have been a
likely accompaniment of the feast in which
these were celebrated; and the like acts of
<span class="pagenum" id="p228">[p.&nbsp;228]</span>
Samuel and Elijah, though for different purposes,
perhaps go in confirmation of the ancient
existence of such a practice (1&nbsp;Sam vii.&nbsp;6;
1&nbsp;Kings xviii.&nbsp;33&ndash;35). Be this as it may,
the idea conveyed by the image of the living
water will be the same:&mdash;&rdquo;Such as is the
refreshment of water from the spring, and
from the clouds of heaven, to the parched lips
and the thirsty land, in this our sultry climate,
such shall be the refreshment of your spirit
in that day from the salvation of Jehovah
He shall dwell among you, and His Spirit
shall be a well of life to the whole nation.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Strachey.</i></p>

<p class="gap">The last day of the feast, known as &ldquo;the
Hosanna Rabba&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Great Day,&rdquo;
found Him, as each day before, doubtless, had
done, in the Temple arcades. He had gone
thither early, to meet the crowds assembled
for morning prayer. It was a day of special
rejoicing. A great procession of pilgrims
marched seven times round the city, with
their lulats [branches of palm woven round
with willow and myrtle], music, and loud-voiced
choirs preceding, and the air was rent
with shouts of Hosanna, in commemoration
of the taking of Jericho, the first city in the
Holy Land that fell into the hands of their
fathers. Other multitudes streamed to the
brook of Shiloah, after the priests and
Levites, bearing the golden vessels, with
which to draw some of the water. As many
as could get near the stream drank of it,
amidst loud chanting of the words of Isaiah&mdash;&ldquo;Ho,
every one that thirsteth, come ye to
the waters,&rdquo; &ldquo;With joy shall we draw water
from the wells of salvation,&rdquo;&mdash;rising in jubilant
chants on every side. The water drawn
by the priests was meanwhile borne up to
the Temple, amid the boundless excitement
of a vast throng. Such a crowd was, apparently,
passing at this moment.</p>

<p>Rising, as the throng went by, His Spirit
was moved at such honest enthusiasm, yet
saddened at the moral decay which mistook a
mere ceremony for religion. It was burning
autumn weather, when the sun had for months
shone in a cloudless sky, and the early rains
were longed for as the monsoons in India
after the summer heat. Water at all times
is a magic word in a sultry climate like
Palestine, but at this moment it had a double
power. Standing, therefore, to give His
words more solemnity, His voice now sounded
far and near over the throng, with soft clearness,
which arrested all&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If any man thirst, let him come unto Me
and drink, for I will give him the living
waters of God&rsquo;s heavenly grace, of which the
water you have now drawn from Shiloah is
only, as your Rabbis tell you, a type. He that
believes in Me drinks into his soul of My
fulness, as from a fountain, the riches of
Divine grace and truth. Nor do they bring
life to him alone who thus drinks. They
become in his own heart, as the whole burden
of Scripture tells, a living spring, which shall
flow from his lips and life in holy words and
deeds, quickening the thirsty around him.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Geikie.</i></p></div>

<p>I. <span class="smcap">The truth on which the admonition
is founded.</span> &ldquo;Great is
the Holy One of Israel in the midst of
thee.&rdquo; This includes&mdash;1.&nbsp;<i>His character,</i>
&ldquo;the Holy One of Israel.&rdquo; The holiness
of God has shown forth in all that
He has done in heaven and on earth
(Ps. cxlv.&nbsp;17); in heaven it is the
theme of the songs of the most exalted
intelligences (Isa. vi.&nbsp;3); on earth it
inspires bad men with dread and dislike
(Isa. xxx.&nbsp;11), and good men with
thankfulness and hope (Ps. xxx.&nbsp;4;
Heb. xii.&nbsp;10; H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I., 2275, 2843).
2.&nbsp;<i>His greatness.</i> &ldquo;Great&rdquo;&mdash;in duration,
wisdom, power, dominion, and
resources. All these render Him terrible
as an enemy, desirable as a
<span class="wsnw">friend.<a id="o181_fna2" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#o181_fn2">[2]</a></span>
3.&nbsp;<i>His residence.</i> &ldquo;In the
midst of thee.&rdquo; But is not God everywhere?
Yes, but not everywhere in
the same character; not in heaven as
in earth, &amp;c. Wherever His presence
is spoken of in a way of promise or
privilege, it is to be distinguished
from His attribute of omnipresence,
<span class="pagenum" id="p229">[p.&nbsp;229]</span>
for it has then in it something peculiarly
beneficial and saving (Deut. iv.&nbsp;7;
Ps. xxxiv.&nbsp;18). God&rsquo;s presence in
the midst of His people is the guarantee
of their safety and the source of their
joy. Let them adore the condescension
He shows in dwelling in their
midst.</p>

<p>II. <span class="smcap">The stirring exhortation.</span>
1.&nbsp;<i>Religion is animated.</i> &ldquo;Cry out
and shout,&rdquo; &amp;c. What is here required
cannot be merely the exclamation,
separate from suitable dispositions
and sentiments, as is the case
with some. Noise is in itself worth
nothing. On the other hand, where
there are these feelings, it is permissible,
yea, praiseworthy, to give free
and exultant expression to them (Rev.
v.&nbsp;12). Some disparage such expressions
as enthusiasm, but there is nothing
that should call forth enthusiasm
like the Gospel. Religion calls for
not only feeling and sentiment, but
for the highest degree of feeling and
<span class="wsnw">sentiment.<a id="o181_fna3" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#o181_fn3">[3]</a></span>
2.&nbsp;<i>Religion, rational as
well as animated.</i> Why is the inhabitant
of Zion to cry aloud and shout?
<i>&ldquo;For</i> great is the Holy One of Israel
in the midst of thee.&rdquo; This more than
justified him, for from hence the
Church can infer <i>safety, assistance, consolation,
honour.</i> Thus God is with
His people, and this is <i>grace:</i> soon
they shall be with Him, and that is
<i>glory.</i>&mdash;<i>William Jay: Sunday Evening
Sermons and Thursday Evening Lectures,</i>

Zion was the name of a high mound
situated upon a bed of rock enclosed within
the walls of Jerusalem, and making the finest
and strongest part thereof. Here was first
the Tabernacle, and then the Temple, and
concerning it great things are declared (Ps.
cxxxii.&nbsp;13&ndash;18). If we look through the literal
description to the spiritual glory discernible,
we shall soon see that it was typical of a
higher state, and a shadow of good things to
come. I need hardly remind you that, by a
figure of speech, Zion is used in the New Testament
as significant of the Church of the
Living God (Heb. xii.&nbsp;22).&mdash;<i>Jay.</i></p>

<p class="gap">Such are the encouragements that consoled
the ancient city of God in the day of her
trouble. Harassed, her garrisons stormed,
her armies scattered, her very sanctuary
threatened with violation, she was bade remember
her Eternal King, and take comfort
in the thought of that watchful Guardian who
sooner or later would assuredly avenge her
wrongs. Often was she taught the same
lesson; and often, in despite of her own
froward and unbelieving heart, was the prediction
realised. The Lord still &ldquo;loved the
gates of Zion;&rdquo; the streams of His holy
&ldquo;river still made glad the city of God;&rdquo; and
He was &ldquo;known in her palace for a refuge.&rdquo;
But a gloomier hour at length arrived; even
Divine patience has its limits; and the last
dread crime of Zion could only be expiated
in her ruin. Blood had flowed beneath her
hands, every drop of which was worth a universe,
and she had invoked its curse upon her
own head and the head of her children. And
now, behold, in the fearful words of her own
prophets, &ldquo;the lion is come up from his
thicket, and the destroyer of the Gentiles is
on his way,&rdquo;&mdash;Jerusalem is ruined and Judah
is fallen, because their tongues and their
doings are against the Lord to provoke the
eyes of His glory. &ldquo;But what?&mdash;is this the
city of which such glorious things are spoken&mdash;that
the Highest Himself should establish
her, that she should not be moved?&rdquo; Where
are His mighty promises of perpetuity?
Where is that foundation which no power
should ever shake&mdash;that Zion, in which the
poor of His people were to trust?</p>

<p>Brethren, look around you, and you behold
the evidences of its existence, and of the
eternal faithfulness of Him who is pledged to
its immortality. A greater than Zion inherits
her name; a greater than Zion bore it in the
far-reaching scope of the prophetic vision.
That &ldquo;city of the great King&rdquo; was but a
perishable emblem of a &ldquo;city whose builder
and maker is God.&rdquo; It is true she was
honoured by His symbolic presence and sanctified
by His sacred worship; it is true that
for ages she alone, in a world of darkness,
held the precious lamp of His truth; but what
are these characters of honour to hers, whose
every living stone is quickened by His indwelling
energy, whose worship is no more
in type and shadow, but in spirit and in substance;
whose preaching and teaching, no
longer shrouded in obscurity and limited to a
corner of the earth, spreads over all lands,
embraces the whole family of mankind, and
makes even the course of that sun whose
&ldquo;going forth is from the end of the heaven
and his circuit unto the ends of it, and from
whose light nothing is hid,&ldquo; a faint image of
the power with which she diffuses through all
nations &ldquo;the light of the knowledge of the
glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ&rdquo;?

Take the Gospel. What is it? Not a
decision of Parliament, or the termination of
a debate which may have no effect on our welfare.
It brings us glad tidings of great joy.
It is infinitely important, it is eternally interesting
to us. It is our life. It is all our salvation,
and it should be all our desire. Therefore
we should receive it as a faithful saying, and
worthy of all acceptation. We should receive
it as a dying man would a remedy, or as a condemned
criminal would hail a reprieve. We
should receive it with feelings superior to
those with which we receive anything else.
It is a subject which rises infinitely above all
others in interest and importance, and demands
all the energies of the soul, and renders
Dr. Young&rsquo;s words the words of truth
and soberness:&mdash;</p>

<h3 class="tdc" id="o182"><span class="smcap">The Day of the Lord.</span></h3>

<p class="bq">xiii.&nbsp;6. <i>Howl ye, for the day of the Lord is at hand.</i></p>

<p>Sad and unnatural is the condition
of those to whom the coming of &ldquo;the
day of the Lord&rdquo; is a cause for dismay.
But this is the condition of the
wicked. They can think of God prevailing
and asserting Himself only
with dread. Dread must take possession
of them whenever they think
of the future, for the profoundest and
most ineradicable instincts of their
nature assure them that the &ldquo;day of
the Lord&rdquo;&mdash;a day of judgment and
retribution&mdash;must come.</p>

<p>Thus far all is plain. But when we
read and think about what is to take
place on &ldquo;the day of the Lord&rdquo;
(vers. 7, 8, 15, 16, 18), astonishment
takes possession of us, and we feel
disposed to call it &ldquo;the day of the
devil.&rdquo; How <i>can</i> a day like this be
called &ldquo;the day of the Lord&rdquo;? Note&mdash;1.&nbsp;That
all the cruelties here described
were inflicted by men. 2.&nbsp;That these
men were moved to inflict these
cruelties by their own passions; that
they acted as free agents, and without
any thought of fulfilling a Divine purpose.
3.&nbsp;That the supreme passion
by which they were moved was the
passion of revenge&mdash;of revenge for
cruelties equally frightful inflicted by
the sufferers of that day. Nothing
can exceed in horror the picture which
the Babylonians themselves drew of
the enormities perpetrated by them on
conquered nations. 4.&nbsp;That, consequently,
the Babylonians were reaping
as they had sown. The day that was
coming upon them was a day of retribution,
and in this sense emphatically
&ldquo;a day of the Lord.&rdquo; As a matter of
fact, retribution is one of the laws
under which we live (H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I., 4609,
4611, 4612), and it is a Divine law, a
law worthy of God. It is an ordinance
of mercy, for the tendency of it is
to restrain men from sin. By their
knowledge of its existence and the
certainty of its operation (P.&nbsp;D., 2995),
wicked men are undoubtedly greatly
restrained from wickedness. Were it
not for the days when it is manifestly
seen in operation, when great transgressors
are overwhelmed with great
sufferings, atheism would prevail; a
reign of terror and of restrained
cruelty would begin, and every day
would be a day of the devil. 5.&nbsp;This
day, with all its horrors, was an
essential preliminary to the accomplishment
of God&rsquo;s purposes of mercy
in regard to His people. For <i>them</i> it
was emphatically &ldquo;a day of the Lord,&rdquo;
for it was the day of their deliverance
from bondage, a day of exultant
thanksgiving that the power of their
relentless oppressors was for ever
broken (chap. xiv.&nbsp;1&ndash;6). In the history
of our race there have been many such
days, <i>e.g.,</i> the French Revolution of
1789, the American Civil War; days
when the worst passions of humanity
were manifested without restraint;
but days when the wisdom of God
was displayed in bringing good out of
evil, in punishing the iniquities of the
past, in ushering in a brighter and
better era of freedom and justice.</p>

<p>The record of such &ldquo;days of the
Lord&rdquo; should be eminently instructive
to us. 1.&nbsp;They should teach us the
true characters of those statesmen who
<span class="pagenum" id="p231">[p.&nbsp;231]</span>
use national power for purposes of
unrighteous national aggrandisement.
They are patriots but traitors, rendering
inevitable a bitter harvest of
national shame and sorrow. 2.&nbsp;They
show the folly of supposing that the
great power of any nation justifies it
in the hope that it may safely deal
unjustly with other and weaker
nations. Guilty nations set in operation
forces mightier and surer in their
operation than any they can command&mdash;those
forming the instrumentality
by which God governs the earth, and
in spite of human passions, maintains
the existence and carrying forward the
development of the human race;
these, combining, bring on a &ldquo;day of
the Lord,&rdquo; in which, by the overthrow
of the haughtiest wrongdoers, His
existence and authority, and the folly
of the practical atheism to which great
nations are prone, are demonstrated
(P.&nbsp;D., 2544).</p>

<h3 class="tdc" id="o183"><span class="smcap">The Doom of the Children of Babylon.</span></h3>

<p class="bq">xiii.&nbsp;16. <i>Their children also shall be dashed to pieces before their eyes.</i></p>

<p>Consider this terrible declaration&mdash;</p>

<p><b>I. As it regards man.</b> 1.&nbsp;As a revelation
of the degradation of which he
is capable. History may be said to be
a manifold revelation to this effect;
the Bible alone gives hope for man,
by disclosing his capabilities of development
and exaltation. 2.&nbsp;As a remindal
that no earthly empire is in
and of itself secure against utter overthrow.
3.&nbsp;As a remindal that what
are called national disasters, are made
up of sufferings endured by a vast
number of individuals.</p>

<p><b>II. As it regards God.</b> So considered,
it should be remembered&mdash;1.&nbsp;That
His permission of such things
is, when viewed comprehensively, only
part of the great mystery of the permission
of evil. 2.&nbsp;That this is an
instance of the working of one of the
great natural laws by which God
governs the universe&mdash;the law of retribution.
3.&nbsp;That in the heart of this
terrible prediction there is a bright
ray of hope. When you see a surgeon
performing a terrible operation on a
patient, you are sure that he is confident
that the patient will be restored
to health. So when we look at the
world as it <i>is,</i> we are certified that
there is a better world <i>to be.</i> God
would never have permitted the world
to be, if He did not see how out of
this present misery He could educe
eternal and triumphant blessedness.
Towards that better future God is
leading on the world (H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I., 3421&ndash;3423).
The revulsion of feeling with
which we read this prediction is one
proof of it; there was a time when
such incidents in the prosecution of a
war would have been regarded as a
matter of course. That it should not
be so now marks an advance, and is a
prophecy of further advances.</p>

<p class="bq">xiii.&nbsp;17. <i>The Medes&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. shall not regard silver; and as for gold, they shall not

<p>I. One of the most universal and
powerful of all passions is the love of
money. Consider&mdash;1.&nbsp;How <i>wide-spread</i>
is this passion. The instant men rise
above utter barbarism, it manifests
itself. Paradoxical as it may sound,
it is one of the first signs that civilisation
has begun. In every civilised

manifests <span class="wsnw">itself.<a id="o184_fna1" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#o184_fn1">[1]</a></span>

It persuades them to endure distressing
privations. It betrays them into the
basest crimes. Up to a certain point,
it may be said to be a useful servant;
it works to promote our welfare, by
<span class="pagenum" id="p232">[p.&nbsp;232]</span>
overbalancing other tendencies that
would degrade and ruin us; but when
once that limit is overpassed, it transforms
itself into a tyrannical master.
Like many an Eastern tyrant, it destroys
all other lawful passions that
might dispute with it the throne (H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I.,
400, 402).</p>

<p>II. But this passion, powerful as it
is, may be controlled and conquered.
&ldquo;The Medes&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. shall not regard
silver; and as for gold, they shall not
delight in it.&rdquo; This means, not that
they should be exempt from the influence
of this worldwide passion, but
that in thee it would be temporarily
overborne by another more powerful
passion&mdash;the passion for revenge. For
years the dominion of Babylon over
them had been maintained by the
most relentless rigour and frightful
cruelties; and when the hour for successful
revolt came, the one thought
of the Medes would be&mdash;<i>Revenge!</i>
That one intense longing would consume
all others; the men on whom it
had laid hold would forget their thirst
for riches.</p>

<p>This really is only an instance and
illustration of what Dr. Chalmers used
to call &ldquo;the explosive power of a
new affection.&rdquo; Many other affections
come up to the human heart, and expel
avarice; <i>e.g.,</i> love of wife or children,
ambition, vanity, &amp;c. We see, therefore,
that the love of money can be conquered,
and as reasonable men always
in danger of being overcome by it, we
should ask by what passion or principle
it can be conquered most nobly.
That principle and that passion is the
love of Christ. Of those who are truly
possessed by it, it may be truly said
that they do not regard silver; and
as for gold, they do not delight in it.
They may have much money, and by
their splendid genius for business may
be constantly gaining much more; but
they possess it, it does not possess
them; they are <i>its</i> masters. By the
use of it they are ennobled. Let us
pray that our hearts may be garrisoned
by this more powerful and noble passion;
then all the assaults of avarice
upon them shall be made in vain. We
shall meet them as Christ Himself
met the offer of all the wealth and
glory of the world; and the result will
be, that we shall possess the true
riches which will be valuable in the
eternal world (Matt. iv.&nbsp;8&ndash;10, vi.&nbsp;19&ndash;21).</p>

In many of those who seem utterly free
from the love of money, it is only dormant;
like the thirst for blood in that tiger which,
captured when a cub, was brought up as a
household pet, but showed itself to be a tiger
indeed when, licking a slight wound in its
master&rsquo;s hand, it first tasted blood. So, many
who appear to be utterly free from the love of
money are so simply because they have never
possessed more than sufficed for their bare
necessities. Let them possess more, and avarice
will show itself. This is the explanation of
the familiar fact, that many who become prosperous
become niggardly; they may continue
to give, but it is always in a steadily diminishing
proportion to their income (H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I.,
4013; P.&nbsp;D., 3068, 3488).</p></div>

<h3 class="tdc" id="o185"><span class="smcap">Spare the Children.</span></h3>

<p class="tdc">(<i>Sunday-School Anniversary Sermon.</i>)</p>

<p class="bq">xiii.&nbsp;18. <i>Their eye shall not spare children.</i></p>

<p>This declaration is made concerning
the Medes, by whom the power of
Babylon was destined to be broken.
So thoroughly bent will they be upon
their mission of revenge, that they will
not be turned away from it by any
appeals to their avarice (ver. 17)
or to their pity (text). The helplessness
of infancy and the innocence
of youth, which are naturally so impressive
and persuasive, will not avail
to stay them in their devastating
career.</p>

<p>We should display a singular ignorance
of the world in which we live, if
we were therefore to pronounce the
Medes exceptional monsters of iniquity.
Alas! there are many imitators
of their relentless cruelty. In our own
land children are not spared in relation
to evils even more terrible than
war. Youth is always beset by dangers,
<span class="pagenum" id="p233">[p.&nbsp;233]</span>
even when it is most carefully
guarded; but when it is specially
under the influence of wicked men,
it is often ruthlessly sacrificed. Wide-spread
is the spirit of evil which
knows not how to pity it. Examples
of its existence and operations are to
be found&mdash;1.&nbsp;In houses where the
most hurtful principles and vicious
practices are continually set before
children. From their youth up they
are not spared from the most disastrous
influences (H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I., 775&ndash;779).
2.&nbsp;In business, where often the most
sacred interests of childhood are sacrificed
for the sake of gain. Their
health, by inflicting upon them excessive
labour. Even their morality, by
fiends who tempt them into haunts of
vice. Compared with these incarnations
of diabolical cruelty, the Medes
were merciful.</p>

<p>The season of childhood appeals to
our concern and should awake our compassion&mdash;1.&nbsp;By
its <i>helplessness.</i> It has to
lean upon others. 2.&nbsp;By its <i>ignorance.</i>
It has had no time to learn (H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I., 780).
3.&nbsp;By its <i>inexperience.</i> Unless it
is aided by the guidance of mature
wisdom, it must almost necessarily go
astray. 4.&nbsp;By its <i>peculiar susceptibility
to every kind of moral influence.</i> To
these appeals let us give reverent,
cheerful, and thoughtful heed. Let
us not be content to shudder at this
prediction concerning the Medes, or
at such historical records as that of
the slaughter of the children of Bethlehem
(Matt. ii.); let us make the
children the objects of our care. 1.&nbsp;Let
us spare <i>our own children,</i> from all unreasonable
demands upon them, from
the mischiefs that will inevitably come
upon them if we do not carefully
train them in the way they should go.
2.&nbsp;Let us spare <i>the children of the poor</i>
from the evils of ignorance. These
evils are terrible and far-reaching.
Not to rescue them from these evils
when we have the power to do so, is
to doom them to them. In the Sunday-school
we have a means to rescue
which we cannot neglect without sin.&mdash;<i>William Manning.</i></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 class="tdc" id="o186"><span class="smcap">Sodom and Gomorrah.</span></h3>

<p class="bq">xiii.&nbsp;19. <i>And Babylon, the glory of the kingdoms, &amp;c.</i></p>

<p>The anticipated destruction of Babylon
is here compared to that of
Sodom and Gomorrah, because of its
completeness, and because of the hopelessness
of any return to that city to
its former glory (vers. 20&ndash;22). The
fate of Sodom and Gomorrah should
be pondered, not merely because it is
here used as a symbol of the fate of
Babylon, but also because of the solemn
lessons it affords in relation to sin.
That memorable overthrow occurred&mdash;I.&nbsp;<i>As
a Divine vengeance upon long-continued
and unmitigated wickedness</i> (Gen.
xviii.&nbsp;20, 21). II.&nbsp;<i>Notwithstanding the
influence of a good man in their midst</i>
(2&nbsp;Pet. ii.&nbsp;7, 8). A man like Lot,
even though he perhaps suffered injury
to his own character, could not
live among people like the Sodomites
without being a witness for better
things and a testimony against their
crimes. III.&nbsp;<i>Notwithstanding the fervent
intercessions on their behalf of an
eminently godly man</i> (Gen. xviii.&nbsp;23, &amp;c.).
IV.&nbsp;<i>The overthrow came at last without
any suspicion on the part of their guilty
inhabitants that their doom was so near</i>
(Prov. xxix.&nbsp;1).</p>

<p>But why dwell upon a fate so awful,
and that occurred so long ago? Because
it is a solemn warning to men
to-day. Listen to our Saviour&rsquo;s teaching
on this point (Matt. xi.&nbsp;20&ndash;24).
From this we learn that the fate of
those who reject Christ will be more
severe even than that which befell
those guilty cities&mdash;1.&nbsp;Because of clearer
light against which they sinned. It cannot
be in any way a trivial thing to possess
the Gospel (2&nbsp;Cor. ii.&nbsp;16). 2.&nbsp;Because
of the more abundant opportunities
of salvation which were afforded
them. 3.&nbsp;Because of the more abundant
and excellent examples set before them.
4.&nbsp;Because of the multiplied examples
of warning to which they should have
given heed.&mdash;<i>William Manning.</i></p>

<h3 class="tdc" id="o187"><span class="smcap">The Joy of Salvation.</span></h3>

<p class="bq">xiv.&nbsp;3, 4. <i>And it shall come to pass in the day, &amp;c.</i></p>

<p>In these verses is described the feeling
of relief and joy of Israel in view
of release from the Babylonish captivity.
So profound will be their sense
of God&rsquo;s deliverance and favour, that
they will look with contempt even
upon the imperious and exacting Babylon,
whose glory will be smitten,
whose strength will be destroyed.</p>

<p>This is an experience known to men
in their spiritual seekings and findings
of God. Blessed is that &ldquo;rest&rdquo;
which follows many a season of sorrow,
and fear, and hard bondage wherein
men are made to serve. Consider&mdash;</p>

<p>I. <span class="smcap">Some joyful deliverances,</span> of
which we may be said to have here a
type. Every soul engaged in a true
search after God can recall such experiences:
first there was the &ldquo;sorrow,&rdquo;
then the &ldquo;joy;&rdquo; first the &ldquo;fear,&rdquo;
then the confidence; first the &ldquo;bondage,&rdquo;
and then the rescue and the
liberty. <i>E.g.,</i> 1.&nbsp;<i>The time of spiritual
conversion.</i> That is often preceded by
deep conviction, anguish, and gloom.
Alarming are those awakenings whose
first mission is to show us our guilt
and danger. Then we feel the grievousness
of the bondage of sin. It is
a time of exile, want, servitude. What
a glorious day is that in which the
Lord gives us rest for our sorrow
and fear, by removing from us the
terrors of the law, and leading us into
the liberty of the Gospel! This is the
deliverance to which our Saviour calls
us (Matt. xi.&nbsp;28). 2.&nbsp;<i>The light which
comes after a period of great mental conflict
and doubt respecting Divine things</i>
also illustrates our subject. Honest
and reverent doubt, which intercepts
a true seeker after God, is no sin. To
creatures who have everything to
learn, doubt is but a part of the
process of learning; all original research,
all independent inquiry, has
more or less of it. But doubt may
become a hard master, a ruthless
tyrant; that which comes from mere
prying curiosity, idle speculation,
empty cavilling, is certain to do so;
in this case doubt, instead of being a
pathway, becomes a prison (H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I.,
4867, 4868). But doubt in any case
is a source of unhappiness; it should
lead, not to scepticism (H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I., 4867,
4868; P.&nbsp;D., 910), but to prayer (P.&nbsp;D.,
915, 916). Those whose prayers for
deliverance from it have been answered,
know how blessed is that day when
the Lord gives them &ldquo;rest.&rdquo; 3.&nbsp;<i>The
period of victory which follows a season of
severe temptation</i> is another illustration.
In most virtues weak, there are sides
of our character specially exposed to
assault. The sin which most easily
besets us proves our oppressor, our
tyrant (H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I., 4482&ndash;4484, 4497&ndash;4499).
Recall the conflicts you have often had,
how often sin has wellnigh proved
fatal to you. What a gracious day
was that when the Lord came to your
help, and gave you rest from your
enemy! 4.&nbsp;<i>The heavenly life hereafter</i>
will be a still better realisation of the
thought before us. To many of God&rsquo;s
people the general character of their
earthly life is so mysterious, burdensome,
and sad, that it <i>all</i> seems a bondage
to them. To such, death will come
as the day of the Lord to give them
&ldquo;rest&rdquo; (H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I., 220, 1623&ndash;1628).</p>

<p>II. <span class="smcap">The real insignificance of
our foes,</span> which in the day of our
deliverance will be made plain to us,
and which should be apprehended by
our faith even now (ver. 4). 1.&nbsp;Greater
is He that is in than all that can
be against us, and therefore, if we be
faithful, our victory is sure (1&nbsp;John iv.&nbsp;4;
Rom. viii.&nbsp;37; H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I., 934, 2368,
2791). 2.&nbsp;By Him even our very foes
and oppressors shall be made to help us.
In the case of Israel, their masters were
to become their servants, their oppressors
their subjects (ver. 2). It is so
in the spiritual life; our very sorrows,
fears, nay, our sins, may be made to
serve great ends; a vanquished fear, a
<span class="pagenum" id="p235">[p.&nbsp;235]</span>
defeated sin, will leave us stronger to
meet the next. Let us so live and
strive, by the grace of God, that, having
triumphed over every evil habit,
every ignoble doubt, every besetting
sin, we may be able to say at last,

<p class="bq">xiv.&nbsp;11. <i>Thy pomp is brought down to the grave.</i></p>

<p>We are perpetually reminded of the
shortness and uncertainty of life (H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I.,
1561). But these truths, so elementary,
so familiar, so important,
and so much forgotten, are most
vividly brought before our minds when
a prince is laid low. Then we see
that only one thing is important, because
only one thing is permanent,
and that is <i>character,</i> by which our
whole future is determined. Happy is
he, whether peasant or prince, whose
is the character of the regenerate, who
possesses a good hope through grace;
wretched is he, whether slave or
monarch, who lives and dies without
it. Reflect&mdash;</p>

<p>I. <span class="smcap">On the death of the wicked.</span>
Always solemn, but especially so when
it is that of a wicked man who was
prosperous. Everything succeeded
with him; he had everything his heart
wished for. But death came; broke
up a whole system of being and comforts,
without furnishing any equivalent
for it; and introduced him to
eternal perdition. Death obscures the
glory of the prosperous transgressors,
robs them of that in which they
delighted, reduces their wealth to
poverty, their honours to eternal
shame, their happiness to eternal
misery. What a transition&mdash;from the
vanities of earth to the realities and
retributions of the eternal world!
from the flattery of their dependants
to the presence of the Judge of all!
You who are living only for earthly
things, think of these things. (H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I.,
1567&ndash;1569; P.&nbsp;D., 684, 741).</p>

<p>II. <span class="smcap">The death of the righteous.</span>
1.&nbsp;The hour of terror, of consummate
terror, to the wicked, is to the Christian
the hour of peace, of hope, of
joy. This arises from his union
with Christ, the Conqueror of death.
What will make a deathbed easy?&mdash;a
broken league with sin, a good
hope through grace, a lively faith
in Christ (H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I., 1590&ndash;1593). 2.&nbsp;The
hour that terminates the prosperous
worldling&rsquo;s glory, introduces the
Christian to an eternal weight of glory
(P.&nbsp;D., 669, 694, 757). 3.&nbsp;The hour
that brings the sinner to the second
death commences the perfectness of the
Christian&rsquo;s life (H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I., 1595&ndash;1600;
P.&nbsp;D., 711).&mdash;<i>Samuel Thodey.</i></p>

<p class="bq">xiv.&nbsp;11. <i>Thy pomp is brought down to the grave.</i></p>

<p>One of the most effectual means of
comforting the Church in times of
oppression, is by predicting the downfall
of her enemies. Here Babylon is
doomed; her monarch, whose conquests
had been so far-reaching, whose
power had proved so irresistible, is
represented as having met with a
<span class="pagenum" id="p236">[p.&nbsp;236]</span>
mightier than himself; as descending
to the abode of the dead; as leaving
behind him a body which, instead of
being honoured with a royal funeral,
has no other covering than the dust
and the worms; and as being himself
insulted by the astonished mockery of
the meanest of those who had preceded
him into the invisible world. His removal
from the world has been as the
cessation of a devastating hurricane,
and the whole earth rejoices thereat;
it re-echoes with songs of gladness
that the dreaded victor has himself
been vanquished. Well may the world
rejoice that its crowned scourges are
not immortal!</p>

<p><b>I. Let us recall some familiar truths
concerning this conqueror of conquerors.</b>
1.&nbsp;<i>He assaults all ranks and
all ages</i> (H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I., 1536, 1557; P.&nbsp;D.,
677, 700, 707, 751, 752). The world
is an unwalled cemetery. Much of
the dust we tread on once lived.
What is the history of the world but
the history of the reign of death?
From Abel to the infant who died a
moment ago, death has executed his
commission without a single pause;
sometimes in quiet forms, dust mingling
with its native dust; sometimes
on a grander scale, by battles, earthquakes,
&amp;c. There are a thousand
doors out of life; they all stand open;
and through some of them death will
lead us all; for, like the great Being
whose servant he is, with him there is
&ldquo;no respect of
<span class="wsnw">persons.&rdquo;<a id="o190_fna1" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#o190_fn1">[1]</a></span>
2.&nbsp;<i>He is not arrested in his career from any
respect for the places of men,</i> however
heroic and useful they may be. How
powerful man often appears in his
collective grandeur, binding the ocean
in chains, controlling the elements,
numbering the stars, building great
cities which look like temples erected
to Time and destined to outlast his
reign, founding empires, and spreading
himself out by commerce and enterprise
to distant islands and continents;
and he has always still greater
projects behind. But while man plants,
death receives his commission; the
ground sinks beneath him, his power
suddenly collapses. Few histories
would be more instructive or impressive
than that of the unfinished projects
of men of might and genius, <i>e.g.,</i>
C&aelig;sar and his proposed digest of law,
Cuvier and his proposed compendium
of science (Ps. cxlvi.&nbsp;4; H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I., 3266,
3273). 3.&nbsp;<i>He determines all character.</i>
Passing to and fro, he finds character
everywhere in the course of formation;
suddenly he brings the process to an
end, and with their character precisely
in the state in which he found it,
those whom he strikes down go into
the eternal world. A certain fact, a
solemn consideration this!</p>

<p><b>II. Let me remind you of the
strange insensibility of mankind to
the existence and operations of this
power, from which none of us can
escape, and which may so unexpectedly
bring all our plans and purposes to an
end.</b> Few men give any practical
heed to the fact that they are mortal
(H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I., 1557&ndash;1565; P.&nbsp;D., 69). The
conduct of mankind in neglecting the
concerns of immortality reverses all the
elements of wisdom. Men bury themselves
in the concerns of time, and
forget that their consciences will have
an awful resurrection in another
world. This insensibility is the more
unpardonable since God uses so many
means to arouse and to instruct us.
Reflect on the momentous character of
life, its shortness, its grand purpose,
its solemn issues; look to the grand
vision beyond the shades of death.</p>

<p><b>III. In order that we may be delivered
from this prevalent insensibility,
let us recall some of the
advantages arising from a frequent
contemplation of, and a Scriptural
preparation for, the approach of death.</b>
1.&nbsp;<i>Preparation for death quite changes its
aspect.</i> To a Christian it would be a
dreadful thing not to die; his would
be the case of a child who was never
to come of age, of an exile who was
never to go home (H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I., 1571&ndash;1578;
P.&nbsp;D. 667, 669, 747). 2.&nbsp;<i>Preparation
for death exalts the character of life.</i> It
dispels much of the gloom of life; the
bright prospect at the end irradiates
all the intervening way. 3.&nbsp;<i>In preparing
for death we become imbued</i>
<span class="pagenum" id="p237">[p.&nbsp;237]</span>
<i>with the temper and the tastes of
heaven</i> (H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I., 1566, 2731&ndash;2737).&mdash;<i>Samuel Thodey.</i></p>

When I look upon the tombs of the

tombs of the parents themselves, I consider
the vanity of grieving for those we must so

<h3 class="tdc" id="o191"><span class="smcap">The Seed of Evildoers.</span></h3>

<p class="bq">xiv.&nbsp;20. <i>The seed of evildoers shall never be renowned.</i></p>

<p>I. <i>This is the verdict of the Scriptures.</i>
They abound in evidence that confirms
it. Whatever may be the resources
of wicked men, true glory does not lie
in their path, and nought that they can do
will avail to secure honourable memory
for their wickedness. On the contrary,
their name and deeds will be
attended with disaster and covered
with shame. And this in spite&mdash;1.&nbsp;Of
the <i>wealth</i> which may be connected
with evil-doing (Job xxi.&nbsp;7&ndash;21; Ps.
iii.&nbsp;5&ndash;7, &amp;c.); or, 2.&nbsp;The <i>power</i> it may
have (Ps. lxxiii.&nbsp;3&ndash;8, 18&ndash;20), even if
it be a confederated power (Prov. xi.&nbsp;21);
or, 3.&nbsp;The <i>ingenuity</i> with which
it may conduct its work (Ps xxxvi.&nbsp;2&ndash;4;
Micah ii.&nbsp;1&ndash;3). These are but
a few of the declarations of the Bible
on this subject.</p>

<p>II. <i>This is also the verdict of human
experience.</i> As a matter of fact, we
see that a wicked course of life is regarded
as a shame. It is held up as
a beacon to be avoided, whilst the
career of the good is held up as a
model to be followed. History is
full of examples of men whose names
are held in universal detestation, notwithstanding
their connection with
ingenuity, wealth, and power. Each
of us knows how well the fact is
proved by myriads of examples in
social life. A persistently wicked
course is known to be a blighted one,
and any attempt to invest it with
glory or renown is felt to be wrong.
We recoil even from the thought
that it should be possible for such
a course to command the homage of
men.</p>

<p>III. <i>This truth gives us great hope for
the future of our world.</i> If it were possible
for wrongdoing to gain for itself
imperishable renown, we might tremble
for the safety of those principles of
righteousness and truth which have
always been regarded as the main
support and stay of good men. Reckless
folly and wild presumption would
become exalted and enthroned, and
we might well shudder at the possibility
that, under the attractions of
successful wickedness, men would rush
in masses and bow down to Evil, declaring
it to be their Good. This abandoned
idolatry, this deep depravity, is
now reached only in isolated cases,
and such are regarded even by godless
men as deplorable and hopeless. It is
a hopeful fact that evildoers have to
carry on much of their work in the
dark, for it is a sure token that, as the
light widens and deepens, the works of
darkness must fall; their covering
will be removed, and their shelter
will be gone.</p>

<p>IV. <i>This truth is also one of encouragement
to every individual Christian in his
efforts after a Christ-like life.</i> Evil-doing
does not fail for want of effort; its
attempts are bold, its struggles are
determined. Yet it is doomed always
to wear the name of dishonour and
shame; a wicked man will never get
glory for his wickedness. But Christian
life is in itself true and real
honour; its glory is as a shining light,
shining more and more unto the perfect
day. The Christian is a son of
God, and no higher dignity than this
is conceivable (H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I., 1073&ndash;1076);
<span class="pagenum" id="p238">[p.&nbsp;238]</span>
he is traversing a path which will for
ever lead him on to scenes of new
splendour and blessedness. Seeing
that this is our high calling and destiny,
let us neither fear nor envy the
seed of evildoers, however strong or
secure they may be, but with greater
persistency than ever let us &ldquo;hold
fast the confidence and the rejoicing
of the hope firm unto the end.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>William Manning.</i></p>

<h3 class="tdc" id="o192"><span class="smcap">A Memorable Answer.</span></h3>

<p class="bq">xiv.&nbsp;32. <i>What shall one answer? &amp;c.</i></p>

<p>Translators and interpreters differ
as to whether the answer in this verse
was intended to be given <i>by</i> or <i>to</i> the
messengers of the nations; as to the
nations whose messengers are here
spoken of; and as to the time when
they came on their errand. Adopting
the view which represents them as
coming to Jerusalem to congratulate
Hezekiah after the marvellous deliverance
of that city from the Assyrians
(chap. xxxvii.&nbsp;36&ndash;38), we remind
you&mdash;</p>

<p><b>I. That the wonders of God&rsquo;s love
to His Church often surprise strangers
as well as friends.</b> For the deliverances
wrought for her are often&mdash;1.&nbsp;<i>Surprisingly
seasonable, e.g.,</i> the overthrow
of the Egyptian host in the
Red Sea, when everything seemed to
favour Pharaoh and to be against
Israel (Exod. xv.&nbsp;13&ndash;15); the deliverance
of Jerusalem from Sennacherib.
2.&nbsp;<i>Astonishing because brought about by
unlikely means.</i> Who could have anticipated
the manner of the deliverance
of Jerusalem on this occasion? [Give
other examples.] 3.&nbsp;<i>Astonishing because
vouchsafed in spite of great provocations
and unworthiness.</i> Every such
deliverance is a work of grace as well
as of power.</p>

<p><b>II. In such times of deliverance
friends and enemies alike wonder at
the secure foundations on which the
Church is built.</b> The literal Zion was
a marvel of architecture (Ps. xlviii.&nbsp;13),
and in this respect it was a worthy
symbol of the <span class="wsnw">Church.<a id="o192_fna1" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#o192_fn1">[1]</a></span>
1.&nbsp;The strength and stability of the spiritual
Zion is guaranteed by the character
and resources of the Builder: <i>&ldquo;The
Lord hath founded Zion.&rdquo;</i> 2.&nbsp;Therefore
we should not fear the might of any
of the adversaries that come up against
her (H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I., 1246&ndash;1251).</p>

<p><b>III. The stability and security of
Zion are sources of delighted satisfaction
to the humblest of her inhabitants:</b>
<i>&ldquo;The poor of His people shall
trust in it.&rdquo;</i> They know they are under
the guardianship of One who is
&ldquo;mighty to save,&rdquo; and who encircles
the least as well as the greatest in
arms of His love. Their consciousness
of poverty and weakness leads
them to rest in Him with an undivided
trust, and they thus attain unconsciously
to the blessedness of those
who trust is in God only, the peace
which rests on the only foundation
that cannot be moved.&mdash;<i>Samuel Thodey.</i></p>

<p class="gap" id="o192A">Mark what the text affirms, <i>&ldquo;The
Lord hath founded Zion;&rdquo;</i> this is the
guarantee of His love and of her
stability: <i>&ldquo;the poor of His people shall
trust in it,&rdquo;</i> or, as the margin has it,
<i>&ldquo;shall betake themselves unto it:&rdquo;</i> this is
the one purpose of Her Divine mission
upon earth&mdash;the care, the teaching,
the education, the guidance of the
poor.</p>

<p>I. <span class="smcap">The security of the Church.</span>
1.&nbsp;The strongest, most fundamental
title to protection is creation. Even
among ourselves no one frames an
object in order to destroy it; he who
makes, makes that he may preserve.
Thus is creation in itself a presumptive
title to protection; and it is
abundantly plain that the strength of
such a bond will ever increase with
the cost of the object produced. In
<span class="pagenum" id="p239">[p.&nbsp;239]</span>
one sense the whole material universe
cost its Creator nothing, for its production
was to Him a thing of infinite ease;
but this cannot be said of the Church.
He spoke to bid the one, He died to
make the other exist. When He beholds
His Church, He sees in it the
monument of His own inexpressible
sorrow; He feels this offspring of His
Divine agonies drawn closer to His
eternal heart by the thought of all it
cost to give her being. 2.&nbsp;In this
Church of His is His own <i>honour</i>
pledged. He hath not covenanted
with the world that now is to immortalise
it; but He has passed His own
word for the perpetuity of His Church
(Matt. xvi.&nbsp;18; Isa. lx.&nbsp;20, 21).
3.&nbsp;The Church, in its ultimate perfection,
is set forth as the very <i>reward</i> of all
the sorrows of its Lord. To &ldquo;see of
the travail of His soul and be satisfied&rdquo;
is His destined crown; this
&ldquo;joy set before Him&rdquo; was that which
enabled Him to &ldquo;endure the cross,
despising the shame.&rdquo; (See also Eph.
v.&nbsp;25&ndash;27.) Shall He be defrauded of
His recompense? 4.&nbsp;There is more
than creation to bind the Church to
Christ, more than promise, more than
reward; there is communion, oneness,
identification. A man may desert his
child; he cannot desert himself.
Even though the Redeemer could forget
His espoused bride; even though
He could deny His plighted promise;
yea, though He could abandon His
own reward, He cannot abandon His
own body (1&nbsp;Cor. xii.&nbsp;27; Eph. i.&nbsp;23,
v.&nbsp;30). With such a union there can be
no separation; if Christ be immortal,
the Church is so; when He
dies she shall perish, but not till then.</p>

<p>II. <span class="smcap">The mission of the Church.</span>
<i>&ldquo;The poor of His people shall trust in it.&rdquo;</i>
The Church of Christ is one vast institute
for the benefit of the poor. The
poor were the special objects of
Christ&rsquo;s solicitude and tenderness, and
they have been, and should be, the
special objects of the Church&rsquo;s care.
Even in her worst days she has had
an open hand for the poor. She
should ever follow the example of her
Lord in caring for their temporal
needs. But it is in the doctrine she
preaches, and the way she preaches it,
that the Church is indeed the poor
man&rsquo;s <span class="wsnw">consoler.<a id="o192_fna2" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#o192_fn2">[2]</a></span>&mdash;<i>William Archer

<h3 class="tdc" id="o193"><span class="smcap">God&rsquo;s Outcasts.</span></h3>

<p class="bq">xvi.&nbsp;4. <i>Let Mine outcasts dwell with thee, Moab.</i></p>

<p><b>I. In the most deserted condition
of His people, God acknowledges them
as His own.</b> <i>&ldquo;Mine outcasts.&rdquo;</i> Sennacherib
thought them his; but though
forsaken by all the world, God claims
them as His own, and avows His
interest in them. Men pursue an opposite
course; when individuals sink
in the social scale, the kindly warmth
of friendship is chilled, and the bond
of intercourse broken (H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I., 23, 24,
2152&ndash;2157; P.&nbsp;D., 1422). But God
is a friend who sticketh closer than
any <span class="wsnw">brother.<a id="o193_fna1" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#o193_fn1">[1]</a></span>
True, they sometimes esteem themselves outcasts even
from Him (Ps. xlii.&nbsp;2), and still more
frequently are thought to be so by the
ungodly (Ps. xlii.&nbsp;3); but in this the
ungodly make a mistake, which in
their case is natural, and God&rsquo;s people
should never wrong Him by suspecting
Him of fickleness (chap. xlix.&nbsp;15).</p>

<p><b>II. God provides a refuge for His
people when and where it might be
least expected.</b> <i>&ldquo;With thee, Moab.&rdquo;</i>
Moab was not a neutral, but a hostile
state, one of Israel&rsquo;s most inveterate
foes, always on the outlook for opportunities
<span class="pagenum" id="p240">[p.&nbsp;240]</span>
to display its hostility. Strange,
therefore, that Moab should be selected
as a protector for Jehovah&rsquo;s outcasts;
strange, but not unexampled. God
often raises up friends for His people
in unexpected quarters, supplies their
needs by unexpected means, or turns
their foes into friends (Prov. xvi.&nbsp;7).
Esau&rsquo;s heart was suddenly changed;
Joseph found favour in the eyes of the
keeper of the prison; Elijah was fed
by ravens; the hungry lions forbore
to touch Daniel, <span class="wsnw">&amp;c.<a id="o193_fna2" /><a href="#o193_fn2"><span class="label">[2]</span></a></span></p>

<p><b>III. God would have His people to
be only sojourners in Moab.</b> His outcasts
were merely to <i>dwell</i> there; they
were not to be incorporated with the
Moabitish nation; they were not to
adopt either the social customs or the
religious beliefs of that people. In
like manner He would have His people
remember always that in this world
they are only sojourners (1&nbsp;Pet. ii.&nbsp;11;
H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I., 5026&ndash;5065).</p>

<p><b>IV. God is preparing to bring His
outcast and scattered people home.</b>
He hath prepared for them a city, and
He will bring them to the city He
hath prepared for them (John xiv.&nbsp;1&ndash;3).
Let them recognise, rejoice in, and
live in harmony with this gracious
purpose (Phil. iii.&nbsp;17&ndash;21).&mdash;<i>Samuel Thodey.</i></p>

Philip Henry says, &ldquo;God&rsquo;s people may
be an outcast people&mdash;cast out from men&rsquo;s
love, their synagogue, their country; but God
will own His people when men cast them out.
They are outcasts, but they are His; and
somehow or other He will provide a dwelling
for them.&rdquo; He adds, that though many of
the rejected ministers were brought very low,
had many children, were greatly harassed by
persecutors, and their friends were unable to
support them, yet in all his acquaintance he
never knew, nor had heard of, any Nonconformist

<span class="wsnw">Supplications.</span><a id="o194_fna1" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#o194_fn1">[1]</a></span></h3>

<p class="bq">xvi.&nbsp;12. <i>He shall come to his sanctuary to pray; but he shall not prevail.</i></p>

<p>In the profoundly affecting picture
which the prophet draws of the calamities
coming on the Moabites, he represents
them as at length, every other
means of relief being exhausted, coming
with sad and weary hearts to their
sanctuary to call upon their god for
deliverance. Their supplications were
destined to fail, for they were presented
to that which had no power to
hear or save (Ps. cxv.&nbsp;4&ndash;8). This line
in this dark picture reminds us of two
facts in the life of the men of our own
time, who see clearly the folly of
idolatry.</p>

<p><b>I. In times of sorrow they are often
seen in the sanctuary.</b> Many who
at other times lead openly irreligious
lives are then seen using the forms of
devotion. This is natural (H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I.,
3718); it is not wrong; that which is
wrong is the infrequency with which
the sanctuary is visited and prayer
offered by them (H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I., 3878, 3879).
It is natural and fitting that in time
of trouble man should seek God in the
sanctuary, for the sanctuary is the
place&mdash;1.&nbsp;Of <i>special promise</i> (Exod. xx.&nbsp;24;
Deut. xii.&nbsp;5; 1&nbsp;Kings ix.&nbsp;3;
Matt. xviii.&nbsp;20). 2.&nbsp;Of&nbsp;<i>special means.</i>
Everything there tends to the production
and increase of a devotional spirit
(H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I., 5078). 3.&nbsp;Of&nbsp;<i>special memory</i>&mdash;of
memories of help obtained, of
sorrows solaced in former times.</p>

<p>II. But all this makes more remarkable
the other fact of which these
words may well remind us, that <b>many
of the supplications that are offered
in the sanctuary are offered in vain.</b>
We know that this is a fact: how is
it to be explained? In such ways as
these&mdash;1.&nbsp;<i>Many of the suppliants have
little or no faith,</i> and faith is the essential
condition of blessing (H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I.,
3827&ndash;3830). 2.&nbsp;<i>Many of the suppliants
are not really in earnest,</i> and lukewarmness
is an offence to the Divine Being
(H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I., 3814, 3815, 3831&ndash;3838).
3.&nbsp;<i>Many of the suppliants are not really
penitent.</i> Their prayers are mere calls
for help in time of distress, and God
<span class="pagenum" id="p241">[p.&nbsp;241]</span>
has nowhere promised to help the impenitent
and rebellious (H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I., 3846,
3858; P.&nbsp;D., 3595).</p>

<p>To point out the causes of the weakness
and failure of such prayers is also
to point out the remedies that must
be applied if the suppliants would
have their prayers &ldquo;prevail.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>William Manning.</i></p>

<p class="gap" id="o194A">In times of trouble, men&mdash;1.&nbsp;Feel
their need of help. 2.&nbsp;Generally
have recourse to fallacious sources

because God is forgotten
or unknown.&mdash;<i>J. Lyth, D.D.: Homiletical

<p><b>I. Of the sweeping destructiveness

<p><b>II. Of the hopefulness of human
life even when it is at its worst</b> (ver.
6). Though the reaper has made sure
<span class="pagenum" id="p242">[p.&nbsp;242]</span>
work, yet enough remains to give
hope. There is here true gospel, suggesting
such thoughts as these:&mdash;1.&nbsp;<i>Begin
at the point of your ability, however
low it may be.</i> Every man is rightly
expected to make use of whatever
power he has. If it is only sight, or
only hearing, or only one hand, one
talent out of ten, he must use it. The
loss of the other nine will not excuse
his neglect of the one he has. 2.&nbsp;<i>Beginning
thus low down, yet in earnest, we
have the assurance of improvement and
progress.</i> We have abundant illustration
of this in the history of the
&ldquo;remnant&rdquo; that was left in Israel (2&nbsp;Chron.
xxx.&nbsp;11; xxxiv.&nbsp;6, 9, &amp;c.).
We see here an encouragement for
every sinner who will awake, though
late, to the true purposes of life.
Redemption is the favourite work of
God. He is on the side of feeble,
struggling men, and delights to encourage
and help &ldquo;the remnant&rdquo;
which is spared (H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I., 934&ndash;941,
956, 958, 2368, 4790&ndash;4792; P.&nbsp;D.,
474). The very purpose for which
Christ came into the world was to help
the struggling, to save the lost. Those
who have been brought down to the
extremity and need and the verge of
despair may find friendship and help
in Him (H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I., 928, 929).&mdash;<i>William Manning.</i></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 class="tdc" id="o196"><span class="smcap">Sanctified Affliction.</span></h3>

<p class="bq">xvii.&nbsp;7, 8. <i>At that day shall a man look, &amp;c.</i></p>

<p>In the prophecies of terror to guilty
nations there is always some provision
of comfort for God&rsquo;s faithful and penitent
people. His prophets were commissioned
to minister hope to His
friends, while they foretold misery to
His enemies. In the text Isaiah, predicting
the overthrow of the ten
tribes, furnishes consolation to the
faithful remnant who had not yielded
to the prevalent idolatry (ver. 6), and
declares that the judgments he announced
would result in the conversion
of many who had been ensnared
by it. We are thus led to consider
<i>the designs of God in the afflictions of His
people.</i></p>

<p><b>I. To recall their wandering hearts
to Himself.</b> <i>&ldquo;At that day shall a man
look to his Maker&rdquo;</i> (H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I., 56&ndash;59,
66&ndash;70). This is the result of sanctified
affliction. Whenever it is seen, it
shows that the processes of grace have
been combined with the trials of providence,
and that the health of the
spirit has been restored by the Physician
of souls. Otherwise affliction
hardens, and the man goes back with
greater eagerness to worldliness or
iniquity, as the retreating wave presently
rolls back upon the beach with
greater velocity than before (H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I.,
223&ndash;228). But not so if the healing
influence has been sought and found.
Then &ldquo;a man will look to his maker&rdquo;&mdash;1.&nbsp;With
a <i>suppliant</i> eye, to find in
Him sources of consolation and a rock
of defence such as the world cannot
furnish (Ps. cxxiii.&nbsp;1, 2; Jonah ii.&nbsp;1).
2.&nbsp;With a <i>penitent</i> eye (Luke xxii.&nbsp;62;
Zech. xii.&nbsp;10). 3.&nbsp;With a <i>confiding</i>
and <i>believing</i> eye (chap. viii.&nbsp;17).
4.&nbsp;With a <i>rejoicing</i> eye (Rom. v.&nbsp;11; Hab.
iii.&nbsp;18).</p>

<p><b>II. To raise their estimate of the
holiness of the Divine character and
the rectitude of the Divine dispensations.</b>
<i>&ldquo;Shall have respect unto the Holy
One of Israel.&rdquo;</i> Sin begins with a
diminished sense of God&rsquo;s holiness,
and conversion is marked by a renewed
impression of it (Ps. li.&nbsp;4).</p>

<p><b>III. To separate them from all sinful
and idolatrous dependencies.</b> <i>&ldquo;He
shall not look,&rdquo;</i> &amp;c. The sin of the ten
tribes was idolatry (2&nbsp;Kings xvii.&nbsp;16),
but here it is foretold that it shall be
brought to an end. Those who had
been guilty of this folly and this sin
would not even <i>look</i> at the altars and
the images they had fashioned with
such care. So God aims by his afflictive
providences to separate His people
from everything in which they put an
exaggerated and unworthy trust (H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I.,
110, 111).</p>

<span class="pagenum" id="p243">[p.&nbsp;243]</span>
the moderate degree in which
God&rsquo;s people are corrected, compared
with the final and exterminating judgments
which fall upon the wicked.
Damascus was to be utterly destroyed
(ver. 1), but a remnant was to be left

<h3 class="tdc" id="o197"><span class="smcap">Forgetfulness of God.</span></h3>

<p class="bq">xvii.&nbsp;10, 11. <i>Because thou hast forgotten, &amp;c.</i></p>

<p><b>I. It is possible to forget the God
of our salvation.</b> 1.&nbsp;The majority of
men habitually forget Him. He very
seldom holds a real and commanding
place in the hearts of any of us. We
are all prone to have our hearts wholly
filled with the cares or pleasures of
life. Even if our aims be in themselves
lawful, we seldom recognise
God in framing or prosecuting them.
Hence the shock which the thought of
God&rsquo;s nearness gives us in times of
calamity, sickness, or expected death.
The very shock shows that we are
open to the prophet&rsquo;s charge. 2.&nbsp;This
forgetfulness of God, to which we are
all so prone, should be recognised to
be a state of peril and guilt. Who is
so near to us as God? who so essential
to us? who has so many claims
upon our grateful and continued remembrance?
To be forgetful of Him
is a sin of which we should think with
shame.</p>

<p><b>II. This forgetfulness of God leads
to false trusts.</b> The throne of our
heart cannot remain vacant; if God
be not there, unworthy objects will
surely take His place. The &ldquo;pleasant
plants&rdquo; and foreign shoots (or &ldquo;strange
slips&rdquo;) here represent the pursuit of
lust and idolatry, and that fatal reliance
on human help which is so
often denounced (chap. ii.&nbsp;22; Jer.
xvii.&nbsp;5). The sin denounced by the
prophet has not become obsolete.
All round about us are men who have
forgotten God, and are seeking and
putting their trust in pleasure, pomp,
money, or knowledge. There is a
pursuit of knowledge, even a &ldquo;science&rdquo;
falsely so called that deliberately excludes
God from its range, and pronounces
Him unknowable! These are
the things for which men live, to which
they devote all they are and have,
from which they look for the happiness
for which their hearts crave;
these are their <i>gods!</i> Forgetfulness
of God necessarily leads to idolatry in
some form or other; desires and tendencies,
in themselves right when
under right control, become occasions
of guilt; God is shifted from the
centre of operations, and the trust of
men itself inevitably on unworthy
objects (H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I., 39).</p>

<p><b>III. These false trusts lead to bitter
disappointments.</b> <i>&ldquo;The harvest shall
be a heap in the day of grief and of
desperate sorrow.&rdquo;</i> At the very time
when abundance of fruit was expected,
nothing awaits the anxious toiler but
disappointment and failure. Mildew,
or blight, or drought, or fire has done
its deadly work, and nothing is left
but rotting masses, heaps of useless
and decaying vegetation. What a sad
picture! barrenness and dearth where
there should be life and plenty! Yet
this is a true picture of the fate of
many who have persisted in their rejection
of God, and in their clinging
to false hopes. A life dedicated to
fashion, pleasure, money-getting, or
worldly ambition, necessarily ends in a
reaping-time of blighted hopes, of darkened
prospects, of remorse and despair
(H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I., 246&ndash;248, 5021&ndash;5025; P.&nbsp;D.,
138, 162, 255, 3592). 1.&nbsp;This result
of a godless life will be found even in
those cases where all the good that
was striven after has been realised;
the heart is still left unsatisfied (Eccl.
<span class="pagenum" id="p244">[p.&nbsp;244]</span>
i.&nbsp;12&ndash;ii.&nbsp;17). 2.&nbsp;&ldquo;Desperate sorrow&rdquo;
is the natural result of discovering that
the time for securing a profitable harvest
is gone (Jer. viii.&nbsp;20; P.&nbsp;D., 2254).</p>

<p>Earnestly consider God&rsquo;s claims upon
you; renounce all false trusts; sow
for that harvest in which there can be
no real disappointment (Gal. vi.&nbsp;7).
Redeem the time that yet remains; to
the worst of us a gracious promise is
still held out (Mal. iii.&nbsp;7; Ps. cxvi.&nbsp;7).&mdash;<i>William Manning.</i></p>

<h3 class="tdc" id="o198"><span class="smcap">The Punishment of the Wicked.</span></h3>

<p class="bq">xvii.&nbsp;12. <i>Woe to the multitude, &amp;c.</i></p>

<p>These verses appear to have no connection
with the prophecies that precede
or follow them, but they seem to
indicate the character and result of the
great invasion of Sennacherib. As a
description of that event, they are most
beautiful and graphic, sufficient to
create terror in the most thoughtless
and boastful sinners. For they remind
them of the ease with which the overthrow
of the rebellious is effected when
God visits them in the midst of their
pride and self-confidence. In regard
to the punishment here depicted, think&mdash;I.&nbsp;<i>Of
the striking contrasts which the
day of visitation reveals respecting the
conduct and the position of the wicked.</i>
Verse 12 shows us the vast and varied
host in fancied security; we have a
magnificent picture of a state of might,
pomp, vainglory, self-confidence; but
ere we reach the end of verse 13, we
see it scattered! Even while it gloried
in its strength, the storm that was to
scatter it had already gathered over it.
We see the same contrast in everyday
life; wicked men secure, strong, boastful&mdash;the
next moment utterly cast down
(Ps. lxxiii.&nbsp;18&ndash;20); or, by the near
approach of death, transformed into
the subjects of pitiable despair (P.&nbsp;D.,
684). II.&nbsp;<i>Of the restless execution
of the sentence of doom.</i> In pursuit of
their wicked schemes, sinners are often
led to a daring defiance of all who
threaten their progress, even of God
Himself; <i>e.g.,</i> Pharaoh (Exod. v.&nbsp;2),
Sennacherib (2&nbsp;Kings xviii.&nbsp;17, &amp;c.).
But how sharp is the rebuke which
God administers; with what terrible
energy are His decrees executed! The
profane boasters become as chaff, as
gossamer before the whirlwind (H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I.,
2298). III.&nbsp;<i>Of the swiftness with
which the sentence of doom is executed</i>
(ver. 14). The morning dawns upon
their noise and pomp, but fast as the
beams of light does their judgment
overtake them; trouble comes at the
eventide, and by the next morning
they are not (P.&nbsp;D., 3413). It is true
that the punishment of the wicked
often seems to be delayed (Eccl. viii.&nbsp;11);
but&mdash;1.&nbsp;Sin and punishment are
inseparable (H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I., 4603&ndash;4610);
and, 2.&nbsp;Whenever the punishment
comes it is sudden. Such is the blinding
and delusive power of cherished
sin that its penalty always finds the
sinner unprepared to receive it; it is
always a surprise and a shock to him.</p>

<p>1. Nations and armies cannot successfully
evade the penalties of their
sins; how much less can the individual
sinner do so! 2.&nbsp;The certainty
of the punishment of all unrepented
sin should lead us seriously to reflect
upon the attitude we are assuming
before God. 3.&nbsp;The subject should
lead to repentance, but not to despair
(Ps. cxxx.&nbsp;7; John iii.&nbsp;16, 17).&mdash;<i>William Manning.</i></p>

<p><b>I. God is able to raise up monuments
and trophies of His grace in the
most unlikely places</b> (vers. 18, 19).
For the historical fulfilments of these
predictions, see the ordinary commentaries.
They should teach us not to
<span class="pagenum" id="p245">[p.&nbsp;245]</span>
despair of the progress of religion in
the most unlikely <i>places,</i> the most unlikely
<i>times,</i> among the most unlikely
<i>persons.</i> The grace of God is able to
subdue the hardest hearts, to enlighten
the darkest minds, to convert the most
guilty natures, to cast out Satan where
his power seems strongest and his
interest most secure. Despair not of
your own salvation (H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I., 2376), of
the salvation of those dear to you, of the
final triumph of the cause of truth (H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I.,
979, 1166&ndash;1168). But recollect
that all that has been done has been
done by the use of appropriate means:
the altar to God in Egypt was built by
human hands, the Ark was not built
by miracle but by means; all the
triumphs we anticipate are to be
achieved by the diffusion of Divine
truth, by the prayers and efforts of the
Church. What effort are <i>you</i> making?</p>

<p><b>II. God often overrules the trials of
life to produce a spirit of prayer, and
to bring men to Himself.</b> <i>&ldquo;They
shall cry unto the Lord because of their</i>

<p><b>III. It is God&rsquo;s prerogative to raise
up a Saviour</b> (ver. 20). Whatever
comforts or deliverances you have had
through the medium of creatures, the
hand of God is to be pre-eminently
acknowledged in them all. Spiritually
we need a great Saviour, and God has
provided one equal to the emergency
of the case. Our guilt is very great,
our danger very threatening, our enemies
very powerful, our ruin very
awful, but help is laid on One that is
mighty. The greatness of Christ as
a Saviour appears from the essential
dignity of His nature (Heb. i.&nbsp;1), from
the certain efficacy of His atonement
(Heb. vii.&nbsp;25), from the countless number
of the redeemed (Rev. vii.&nbsp;9), from
the completeness of the salvation He
imparts (1&nbsp;Cor. i.&nbsp;30).&mdash;<i>Samuel Thodey.</i></p>

<p class="bq">xix.&nbsp;22. <i>And the Lord shall smite Egypt, &amp;c.</i></p>

<p><b>I. The benevolent design of God in
chastisement.</b> God smites in order to
heal. Scripture teaches throughout
that God&rsquo;s dealings with men are&mdash;1.&nbsp;<i>Not
capricious.</i> 2.&nbsp;<i>Not indiscriminate.</i>
3.&nbsp;<i>Not unjust.</i> He does not impose
burdens that cannot be borne, nor
exact obedience which man cannot
render, nor select favourites for preference
or victims for vengeance,
without any regard to the relations
existing between man and Himself.
Contrary to all this, God&rsquo;s smiting is
that&mdash;(1)&nbsp;of a <i>Rescuer,</i> who inflicts
blows upon the chains that He may set
us free; (2)&nbsp;of a <i>Physician,</i> who in
mercy probes the wound that He may
heal it; (3)&nbsp;of a <i>Father,</i> who uses the
rod for the salutary purposes of correction
and reformation (H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I., 56&ndash;74).</p>

<p><b>II. The conduct befitting in men
when under chastisement.</b> <i>&ldquo;And they
shall return,&rdquo;</i> &amp;c. This return includes&mdash;1.&nbsp;<i>Submission</i>
(H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I., 143). 2.&nbsp;<i>Entreaty
for help.</i> (See also ver. 20.). This
involves humble confession of sin, and
hearty reliance upon God (H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I.,

manifested in the fulfilment of vows.
(See also verse 21.)&mdash;<i>William Manning.</i></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 class="tdc" id="o201"><span class="smcap">The Burden of Dumah.</span></h3>

<p class="bq">xxi.&nbsp;11, 12. <i>The burden of Dumah, &amp;c.</i></p>

<p>There are three distinct prophecies in this
chapter, and they are all termed <i>burdens,</i> as
denoting heavy judgments. The first respects
Babylon; the next, <i>Dumah,</i> Idumea, or Edom,
inhabiting Mount Seir; and the last, Arabia.</p>

<p>The fall of Babylon by the Medes and Persians
is announced under the form of a <i>watchman</i>
stationed to discover approaching objects,
with orders to declare what he saw (vers. 6&ndash;9).
It was an event peculiarly interesting to
Judah. Babylon was the floor on which Judah
was to be threshed, till the refuse should be
separated from the grain. The event which
destroyed the one delivered the other (ver. 10).</p>

<p>The fall of Babylon was interesting to other
nations as well as Judah; particularly to the
Idumeans or Edomites, who were reduced to
servitude within a few years after the taking
<span class="pagenum" id="p246">[p.&nbsp;246]</span>
of Jerusalem. Now, seeing that Judah had
received a favourable report, Edom must needs
inquire of the watchman (like Pharaoh&rsquo;s baker
of Joseph, after he had announced good
tidings to the butler), whether there was nothing
equally favourable to them. [We are not
to understand, however, that messengers were
really sent out of Edom to Isaiah; the process
was merely a pneumatical one.&mdash;<i>Delitzsch.</i>]
The answer is, <span class="smcap">Nothing;</span> but, on the contrary,
the lot of Judah&rsquo;s enemies, &ldquo;a burden.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The revolution would indeed, for a time,
excite the joy of the conquered nations (chap.
xiv.&nbsp;7, 8); but the Edomites should meet with
a disappointment. To them a change of government
should only be a change of masters.
The fair morning of their hopes should issue in
a long and dark night of despondency. In the
day of Babylon&rsquo;s fall, according to the prayer
of the captives, when every prisoner was lifting
up his head in hope, Edom was <i>remembered,</i>
as excepted from an act of grace, on account of
his singular atrocities (Ps. cxxxvii.&nbsp;7&ndash;9).</p>

<p>The Edomites were very impatient under
the Babylonish yoke, and very importunate in
their inquiries after deliverance; reiterating
the question, &ldquo;What of the night? Watchman,
what of the night?&rdquo; When will this
dark and long captivity be ended? And now
that their hopes are repulsed by the watchman&rsquo;s
answer, they are exceedingly unwilling
to relinquish them. Loth to depart
with an answer so ungrateful, they linger, and
<i>inquire</i> again and again, in hopes that the
sentence may be reversed. But they are told
that all their lingering is in vain. &ldquo;If ye
will inquire, inquire ye, return, come&rdquo; again;
yet shall your answer be the same.</p>

<p>And what was the crime of the Edomites
that should draw down upon them this heavy
<i>burden,</i> this irresistible doom? <i>Their inveterate
hatred of the people of God</i> (Obad. 10).
Perhaps there was no nation whose treatment
of Israel was so invariably spiteful, and whose
enmity was accompanied with such aggravating
circumstances. They were descended
from Abraham and Isaac, and were treated by
Israel, at the time they came out of Egypt, as
brethren; but as they then returned evil for
good (Num. xx.&nbsp;14&ndash;21), so it was ever afterwards.
Their conduct, on the melancholy
occasion of Jerusalem being taken by the
Chaldeans, was infamous (Obad. 10&ndash;16).</p>

<p>The passage affords a tremendous lesson to
ungodly sinners, and <i>especially to those who,
having descended from pious parents, and possessed
religious advantages, are, notwithstanding,
distinguished by their enmity to true religion.</i>
The situation of the Edomites rendered it impossible
for them to be so ignorant as other
heathen nations of the God of Israel; and
their hatred appears to have been proportioned
to their knowledge. Such is the character of
great numbers in the religious world. They
have both seen and hated the truth. The
consequences will be, if grace prevent not,
they will flatter themselves awhile with vain
hopes; but, ere they are aware, their morning
will be changed into an endless night.</p>

<p>Edom was once addressed in the language of
kindness and brotherly affections; <i>but having
turned a deaf ear to this, all their inquiries after
deliverance are now utterly disregarded.</i> Such
will be the end of sinners. &ldquo;When once the
Judge hath risen up and shut the door,&rdquo; they
may begin to knock, may inquire and return,
and come again, but all will be in vain; a night
of ever-during darkness must be their portion.</p>

<p>The passage also, taken in its connection,
holds up to us <i>the different situation of
the friends and enemies of God under public
calamities.</i> It is natural in such circumstances
for all to inquire, &ldquo;What of the night?
Watchman, what of the night?&rdquo; Each, also,
may experience a portion of successive <i>light</i>
and <i>darkness</i> in his lot. But the grand difference
lies in <i>the issue of things.</i> God&rsquo;s people
were thrashed on the floor of Babylon; and,
when purified, were presently restored. To
them there arose light in darkness. Weeping
continued for a night, but joy came in the
morning. Not so with Edom; their night
came last. Such will be the portion of God&rsquo;s
enemies: they may wish for changes, in hope
of their circumstances being bettered; but
the principal thing wanting is a change
in themselves. While strangers to this, the
oracles of Heaven prophesy no good concerning
them. A morning may come, but the night
cometh also.&mdash;<i>Andrew Fuller: Complete Works,</i>
pp. 514, 515.</p>

<p class="gap" id="o201A">The whole Bible has, as its common and
pervading argument, one mighty subject,
which, appearing in a thousand different
forms, is substantially the same in every page
of the sacred volume. That subject is, the
salvation appointed for the chosen of mankind
and the ruin decreed for those who reject
the offer. Therefore when the prophetic
Scriptures publish to us promises of peace and
denunciations of woe, let us never deem that
the Divine Spirit had no <i>ulterior</i> purpose in
these predictions. Let us never cast aside the
volume and cry that we are not Edom, or
Egypt, or Babylon, or Tyre; and that, therefore,
we have nothing to do either with their
crimes or their punishment. Let us not
vainly dream that the mighty machinery of
the prophetic messages was put into play
merely to call down curses on a few of the
temporary dynasties of this perishable world!
&ldquo;All Scripture was written for <i>our</i> use,&rdquo; and
these &ldquo;springing and germinant prophecies&rdquo;
(as they have been called) have a significancy
beyond the revolutions of petty kingdoms.
They represent, in majestic order and manifest
type, the great truths of eternal salvation
and eternal ruin; they exhibit, in the sensible
language of exterior imagery, what the
great Teacher of after-times gave in the higher
language of spiritual truth. If the laws of
God be uniform and unchangeable, we are
justified in reading by this light from <i>heaven</i>
the prophetic declarations of the course and
principles of His earthly providences.</p>

<p>With such views as these elevating our
thoughts beyond the details of perished empires
<span class="pagenum" id="p247">[p.&nbsp;247]</span>
into the mightier truths of the eternal
empire of our God, let us reflect briefly upon
the words before us.</p>

<p>The prophet appears to introduce himself
as addressed in scorn by the people of the
land which he is commissioned to warn.
&ldquo;Watchman, what of the night?&rdquo; What
new report of woe hast thou to unroll, who
has placed thyself as an authorised observer
and censurer of our doings? But the prophetical
watchman&mdash;the calm commissioner of
Heaven&mdash;replies, adopting their own language,
&ldquo;Yea, the morning (the true morning of hope
and peace) cometh, and also the night (the real
and terrible night of God&rsquo;s vengeance); if ye
will (if ye are in genuine earnest to inquire),
inquire! Return, come.&rdquo; Obtain the knowledge
you see, the knowledge of the way of
life; and, acting upon this knowledge, repent
and return to the Lord your God.</p>

<p>Regard, then, the guilty Edom that is
warned; and the office and answer of the
watchman who warns it.</p>

<p>I cannot now undertake to count over the
array of those who address the spiritual
watchmen of the Church of Christ in tones of
derision, and mock their ministry. Some
there are who ask the report of &ldquo;the night&rdquo;
with utter carelessness as to the reply; some
there are who ask it in contempt.</p>

<p>But what is still the duty of him who holds
the momentous position of watchman in the
city of God? On the occasion before us, remark&mdash;1.&nbsp;He
did not turn away from the
question, in whatever spirit it was asked.
2.&nbsp;He uttered with equal assurance a threat
and a promise. 3.&nbsp;He pressed the necessity
of care in the study, and earnest inquiry after
the nature, of the truth; and he summed up all
in an anxious, a cordial, and reiterated invitation
to repentance and reconciliation with an
offended but pardoning God. Thus, the single
verse might be regarded as an abstract of the
duties of the ministerial office.&mdash;<i>W. Archer
Butler: Sermons,</i> vol. ii. pp. 339&ndash;345.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 class="tdc" id="o202"><span class="smcap">Night and Morning.</span></h3>

<p class="bq">xxi.&nbsp;11, 12. <i>Watchman, what of the night?</i></p>

<p>That there is night in this world few
will question. He must be a bold
optimist who thinks everything as it
is, is for the best possible in the best
possible of worlds. Darkness still
covers the earth. God&rsquo;s children, who
have a glorious light within them,
have a dark night all round about
them. Night is the symbol of gloom
and suffering; and it is the season of
sin. It is moral night, because &ldquo;men
loved darkness rather than light.&rdquo; Every
true-hearted, earnest Christian is a
watchman: he watches for his own
soul, and for the souls of others; and
he longs for the advent of the world&rsquo;s
new morning, when the shadows shall
flee away. Regarding the earnest
Christian as the person accosted in the
text, what are his thoughts and fears
about the night? What are his hopes
about the morning?</p>

<p>1. <i>When the Christian looks out upon
the world, he sees himself surrounded by
the night of unbelief and irreligion, and
yet he beholds streaks of sunny dawn.</i>
There are many things at which if he
looked exclusively he would despair&mdash;materialism
taught by popular teachers,
atheism the creed of not a few, abounding
luxury, sensuality defiling and degrading
all classes of the community.
But, looking beyond these, he sees evidences
of Christian truth and hope
such as the world never before witnessed&mdash;Sunday-schools,
tract societies,
home and foreign missions, various
organisations for Christian labour,
generously supported and efficiently
maintained; and, as he looks, he feels
that the morning draweth nigh.</p>

<p>II. <i>When the Christian man looks into
his own heart, he sees much that speaks of
the night, but much also that tells of the
coming morning.</i></p>

<p>III. <i>The Christless man, as well as
the Christian, may well ask, &ldquo;What of
the night?&rdquo;</i> He may relieve the gloom
of his existence by a few sparks of
transient merriment, but soon they
will be all extinguished; and for him
there will be no morning!&mdash;<i>W.&nbsp;M.
Statham: Christian World Pulpit,</i> iii. 193.</p>

<p class="gap" id="o202A">Passing from the historical application
of this oracle, we observe that it
may be taken as setting forth the
spirit of inquiry first raised in the soul
by the hand of God, the form that
inquiry will take, the answer it will
receive, and the direction in which it
will find ultimate satisfaction.</p>

<p><b>I. Thoughts on the spirit of religious
inquiry.</b> The picture before us
<span class="pagenum" id="p248">[p.&nbsp;248]</span>
is that of a walled city; the middle
watch of the night, when the citizens
are asleep. But one anxious spirit
cannot sleep; he turns out into the
dark, silent, deserted street, oppressed
by a strange feeling that something is
going to happen. He hears the heavy
footfall of the watchman pacing to and
fro on the city walls. With eagerness
not to be repressed, he cries, &ldquo;Watchman,&rdquo;
&amp;c. This is symbolical; it has
its counterparts in our own time.
1.&nbsp;<i>This restless inquirer is the exception.</i>
The many sleep, only one wakes and
inquires. The danger is common,
but only one feels any apprehension of
it. There are multitudes of sinners,
few inquirers concerning the way of
salvation. 2.&nbsp;<i>The spirit of inquiry appears
in an unexpected quarter.</i> A man
of Seir, an Edomite, lifts up eager
questions; the men of Israel sleep. The
old, old story. Many lepers in Israel:
Naaman cleansed; ten healed, the
Samaritan only returns to give thanks.
The boldest ventures of faith were
made by the Gentile centurion and the
Syro-Ph&oelig;nician woman. Those who
pressed into the kingdom were not
Scribes and Pharisees, but publicans
and sinners. So it is still. 3.&nbsp;<i>The
inquiry was well directed.</i> The appeal
was not to the citizens who were asleep,
but to the watchman who was awake.
If you have questions to ask, ask of
the man of quick perception, keen
sensibility, high standing, broad and
firm basis of hope in Christ. Not
necessarily of the minister, but of the
man who is spiritually wide-awake; he
is the true watchman. 4.&nbsp;<i>The inquiry
was weighty.</i> What of the night? Is
it far spent? When will the day
dawn? What of the foe? Are they
quiet in their camp? Or are they
endeavouring to surprise and capture
the city? We have all cause to put
questions of corresponding importance.
5.&nbsp;<i>This inquiry was earnest.</i> In some
cases the inquiry is listless, is only a
matter of compliment; or it is entered
upon reluctantly, as an unpleasant
duty. But this man is in earnest.
He calls again and again. He <i>will</i> be
heard; it is a matter of moment to
him. He does not know what is about
to happen; the watchman should know&mdash;placed
high, outlook wide, senses
trained. The inquirer will not submit
to be disregarded. Oh, for more of
this earnestness.</p>

<p><b>II. Thoughts on the answer.</b>
1.&nbsp;<i>The answer comes through the watchman.</i>
Human lips start inquiries and through
human lips the answer comes. One
heart is filled with fear; another heart
filled with faith must be its helper.
Let those to whom the answer has been
entrusted give it promptly, clearly,
joyfully. 2.&nbsp;<i>The answer declares God&rsquo;s
methods with men.</i> God has two great
methods: one has its image in the
<i>morning,</i> the other in the <i>night.</i> Let
<i>morning</i> set forth compassion, tender
mercy, loving gifts; <i>night,</i> judgment,
awful anger, heavy inflictions. If
the morning be neglected or resisted,
then the night will certainly fall upon
you. Note the order in which these
methods are employed. 1.&nbsp;<i>Morning,</i> fresh,
clear, dewy, bracing, beautiful, comes
first. So in the history of the world,
of the Church, of the individual. First
the morning of youth! prize it highly,
use it wisely. Upon the sinner comes
first the morning of mercy, of invitation,
of entreaty and promise. Alas
that he should despise and neglect it!
2.&nbsp;But the <i>night</i> comes afterwards!
True, the night of death comes to all,
but there is an infinite distance between
death <i>in</i> Christ and death <i>out of</i> Christ.
He who dies <i>in</i> Christ, passes into the
eternal day; he who dies <i>out of</i> Christ,
is cast into &ldquo;the outer darkness!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Inquire&rdquo;&mdash;seek to know the way
of salvation. <i>&ldquo;Return&rdquo;</i>&mdash;as the prodigal
from the far country. <i>&ldquo;Come&rdquo;</i>&mdash;blessed
word! &ldquo;Come&rdquo; penitently,
believingly, <span class="smcap">now</span>!&mdash;<i>J.&nbsp;R. Wood.</i></p>

<p class="gap" id="o202B">&ldquo;Night&rdquo; is suggestive of anxious,
perplexed, critical states; <i>e.g.,</i> travellers
in the desert, voyagers on the ocean,
sufferers in the sick-chamber. Very
naturally do we transfer such thoughts
as these to our spiritual experiences
(Ps. cxxx.&nbsp;1, 8). Our text may be
taken as suggestive of the World&rsquo;s
Cry and the World&rsquo;s Hope in all ages.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="p249">[p.&nbsp;249]</span>
I. <span class="smcap">The world&rsquo;s cry.</span> <i>&ldquo;What of
the night?&rdquo;</i> This is&mdash;1.&nbsp;<i>The cry of a
soul awakened to its guilt.</i> The very
purpose of conviction is to show the
sinner his wandering, downward, benighted
state. Hence the terror which
first views of guilt usually cause. The
flash which in the midnight hour
shows the traveller the path of safety,
also shows him the dreadful precipice
which yawns at his feet. When the
sinner is aroused from his sinful career,
he is bewildered by the many voices of
hope and fear, of warning and promise,
which greet his ear; he is oppressed
with anxiety to know how such a night
of danger and heart-searching will end.
2.&nbsp;<i>The cry of a soul struggling with its
doubts.</i> The night of mystery often
burdens the hearts of true believers,
as Job and David found when they
struggled with the great problems of life.
Life is a new thing to each of us, and
many of the same problems perplex us
still: <i>e.g.,</i> the existence of moral evil,
the infinite goodness of God, the truth
of Divine revelation. These sometimes
press upon us with unusual weight, and
shroud us in thick darkness. 3.&nbsp;<i>The cry
of the Church in its hours of anxiety and
peril.</i> These have been frequent, and have
been due to many causes: <i>e.g.,</i> persecution
from without, indifference within,
general ungodliness and unholy living,
tides of scepticism. The watchmen of
the Church have to keep an earnest
and anxious vigil when such nights as
these settle upon her. 4.&nbsp;<i>The cry of
humanity itself.</i> There are times when
not merely a few men are oppressed by
the burdens of their time, but when
men in the mass become awake to
them. The world betrays its keen
sense of disease by the strong remedies
it employs. Against wide-spread
ignorance, it opposes vast educational
schemes; for deep-rooted vices, it contrives
various measures of reformation;
under a sense of the terrible ravages of
the war-spirit, it yearns for international
peace. Nations, as well as individuals,
have trying experiences of the terrors
of social and moral night.</p>

<p>II. <span class="smcap">The world&rsquo;s hope.</span> <i>&ldquo;The morning
cometh.&rdquo;</i> In the midst of all the
world&rsquo;s darkness we may cherish this
blessed hope (H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I., 3421&ndash;3423). But
whence is it derived? Solely from the
fact that God in Christ is reconciling
the world unto Himself. It is along
the track of Divine revelation that we
look for the bright rays of the morning.
There is hope for our race because
of what Christ is&mdash;the Revealer of God,
the Saviour of sinners, the Head of
the Church, the Restorer of humanity.
The way, then, to help on the dawning
of that day we all long to see, is to
live <i>in</i> Him, to live <i>for</i> Him. Life
derived from Him, and spent for Him,
will be truly blessed in itself, and
will be a means of blessing others.&mdash;<i>William Manning.</i></p>

<h3 class="tdc" id="o203"><span class="smcap">The Grievousness of War.</span></h3>

<p class="bq">xxi.&nbsp;15. <i>The grievousness of war.</i></p>

<p>In our quiet sanctuary, so full of
holy and peaceful memories, let us
think about war; the more deeply we
do so, the more will the aptness of the
phrase which forms our text become
apparent to us.</p>

<p><b>I. The grievousness of war is seen
in its causes.</b> War is grievous in its
origin and in all the things that foster
it. It has its origin in the unholy
lusts and pitiful mistakes of mankind
(Jas. iv.&nbsp;1). These lusts and mistakes,
what are they? 1.&nbsp;The lust for
increased possessions and for power
(P.&nbsp;D., 143, 150). 2.&nbsp;The false glory
with which war has been invested. To
steal and kill on a small scale is infamous,
but to do so on a large scale
is heroic! The wholesale butcher
surrounds himself with pomp and
pageantry that dazzle the eye and enslave
the mind (P.&nbsp;D., 3470, 3476).
3.&nbsp;Blindness to the real fields on
which true courage and heroism are
manifested. The Christian courage
which can meet and overcome the assaults
<span class="pagenum" id="p250">[p.&nbsp;250]</span>
of wickedness, which can turn
aside the edge of scorn, and hurl back
the weapons of temptation; that can
urge men through living martyrdoms
which do not keep time to music or
song, which carries Moffat into South
Africa, &amp;c.,&mdash;this is too ethereal for
most men to discern or admire. They
have no suspicion of the moral victories
that might be theirs on the fields of
humble service and self-sacrifice.
4.&nbsp;Insensibility to the worth of human
souls. A suspicion of the value of life
would unnerve the warrior for his task;
he could not then, as he does now,
regard men as mere food for powder.</p>

<p><b>II. The grievousness of war is seen
in its effects.</b> These are twofold:&mdash;1.&nbsp;<i>Physical.</i>
&ldquo;The grievousness of war&rdquo;
cannot be exaggerated, if we look at it
from this point of view alone. Think&mdash;(1)&nbsp;of
the physical and mental suffering
that is caused by it (P.&nbsp;D., 3468, 3469,
3472, 3476); (2)&nbsp;of the far-reaching and
crushing desolation caused by it (P.&nbsp;D.,
3466); (3)&nbsp;of the frightful cost of preparation
for war; of the armed truce in
which the nations of Europe live.
2.&nbsp;<i>Moral.</i> These are still more terrible.
(1.)&nbsp;War brutalises those actually engaged
in it (P.&nbsp;D., 3464). (2.)&nbsp;War
makes criminals by producing a state
of want. (3.)&nbsp;War aggravates national
animosities, and leaves to unborn
generations a legacy of hatred. Every
war sows the seeds of future conflict.
(4.)&nbsp;War and preparation for war check
the progress of those agencies by
which the misery of our race would be
abated, and its happiness indefinitely
increased. The cause of education, of
mission, of the Gospel, languishes
under the blight of the war-spirit.
The cost of a very few wars would
evangelise the world (P.&nbsp;D., 3476).</p>

<p>Let this meditation move us to
action. 1.&nbsp;Let us exert our utmost
influence to bring it to pass that
national power shall be wielded by men
who love peace. 2.&nbsp;Let us encourage
everything that tends to facilitate international
intercourse (P.&nbsp;D., 3461).
3.&nbsp;Let us on every possible occasion
exalt moral qualities above mere physical
daring (P.&nbsp;D., 1798, 1810&ndash;1803).
4.&nbsp;Let us put forth every effort to diffuse
the principles of Christianity. The
Gospel is the only true and effectual
peacemaker; only in Christ will men
ever be lastingly reconciled to each
other.&mdash;<i>William Manning.</i></p>

<p class="bq">xxii.&nbsp;18. <i>He will surely violently turn and toss thee like a ball into a large country.</i></p>

<p>Such was the prophet&rsquo;s message to
a haughty statesman who prided himself
on his power. Learn from it&mdash;1.&nbsp;<b>The
ease with which God effects His
judgments.</b> There are many things
we wish to do which require great
preparations and extensive machinery;
but to toss a ball from the hand is an
easy matter, mere child&rsquo;s play. He
who takes up the isles as a very little
thing, performs all His works with an
ease which cannot be baffled or disturbed.
2.&nbsp;<b>The utter uselessness of
any resistance to the Divine judgments.</b>
As surely as a ball must
follow the line of projection, so surely
must we go whither the judgments of
God carry us when His set time to
visit us is come (H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I., 2269, 4960).

<h3 class="tdc" id="o205"><span class="smcap">The Glory of the Messiah.</span></h3>

<p class="bq">xxii.&nbsp;24. <i>And they shall hang upon him all the glory of his father&rsquo;s house&mdash;</i></p>

<p>As on the nails or spikes fixed in
the walls of the ancient temples and
palaces it was customary to hang suits
of armour, shields, helmets, swords,
&amp;c., that had been taken in war as
spoils of victory, or that had been
used by illustrious ancestors. The
declaration is made concerning Eliakim,
<span class="pagenum" id="p251">[p.&nbsp;251]</span>
and the meaning of it is, that
all his relatives would connect with
him all they deemed illustrious, and
would rest upon him as their common
support. Some of the expressions
used concerning him are appropriated
by our Redeemer to Himself (comp.
ver. 22 and Rev. iii.&nbsp;7); and, without
adopting the view that Eliakim was a
type of Christ, we may say that, true
as this declaration was concerning
Eliakim, it is still more eminently true
of Him to whom &ldquo;the key of David&rdquo;
belongs by right. Upon <i>Him</i> &ldquo;they
shall hang all the glory of His Father&rsquo;s
house.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I. <span class="smcap">The glory that is placed
upon Christ.</span> Applying the text to
Christ, the phrase &ldquo;His father&rsquo;s house&rdquo;
acquired a new and more glorious
significance, even that of the Church
of the living God, the one family in
heaven and on earth. All the glory of
that spiritual and eternal house depends
upon and is justly ascribed to
Christ. 1.&nbsp;<i>All the glory of purchasing
the Church.</i> All the persons of whom
it is composed were in circumstances
of bondage and misery, yea, under
sentence of death, for which He ransomed
them at inconceivable cost (1&nbsp;Pet.
i.&nbsp;18, 19). 2.&nbsp;<i>All the glory of redeeming
the Church.</i> This is not a mere
repetition of what has just been said.
We are the subjects of a twofold redemption&mdash;a
redemption of price and
a redemption of power. From the
penalties of sin Christ redeemed us by
His blood; from the power of sin, by
His Spirit. A supremely difficult and
an eternally glorious task is that which
He thus undertook and has accomplished.
3.&nbsp;<i>All the glory of preserving the
Church.</i> What a marvellous history of
dangers and deliverances it has had!
4.&nbsp;<i>All the glory of perfecting the Church.</i>
It shall be complete in number, complete
and resplendent with every spiritual
grace. Remember what marvellous
symbols are employed to set forth
the beauty and the preciousness of its
component parts, what treasures of
spiritual wisdom and grace are already
included in it. Hereafter, when it shall
stand in all its radiance, the wonder
and the admiration of all heavenly intelligences,
all the glory of it shall
hang upon Christ.</p>

<p>II. <span class="smcap">The persons who unite in
placing this glory on Christ.</span>
&ldquo;<i>They</i> shall hang,&rdquo; &amp;c. 1.&nbsp;The penitent
sinner hangs upon Christ all the glory
of his hope of acceptance with God.
2.&nbsp;The justified believer hangs upon
Him all the glory of the favoured position
in which he stands. 3.&nbsp;The spiritual
veteran hangs upon Him all the
glory of his triumphs. 4.&nbsp;The dying
Christian hangs upon Him all the
glory of the calmness and courage with
which he advances to the final victory.
5.&nbsp;The glorified Church hangs upon
Him all the glory of its perfected
salvation. 6.&nbsp;Angels and archangels,
though they were not the subjects of
redemption, join in the song of salvation
(Rev. v.&nbsp;11&ndash;13), and ascribe to
Him all the splendour in which they
shine. 7.&nbsp;<span class="smcap">God</span> exalted Him to the right
hand of power, and gave Him a Name
above every name (Phil. ii.&nbsp;9&ndash;11).</p>

<p class="bqpoemr">&ldquo;Oh that with yonder sacred throng<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We at His feet may fall,<br />

<h3 class="tdc" id="o206"><span class="smcap">Glorifying God in the Fires.</span></h3>

<p class="bq">xxiv.&nbsp;15. <i>Glorify ye the Lord in the fires.</i></p>

<p>We are required to honour God, not
only in all we do (1&nbsp;Cor. x.&nbsp;31), but
in all we suffer (<i>text</i>). Consider&mdash;</p>

<p>I. <span class="smcap">The state here supposed.</span> <i>&ldquo;In
the fires.&rdquo;</i> Fire and water are both
Scriptural figures of affliction (Ps. lxvi.&nbsp;12;
Isa. xliii.&nbsp;2; 1&nbsp;Pet. iv.&nbsp;12). Stripped
of metaphor, the passage before
us supposes a state of suffering. In
this state we may be found&mdash;1.&nbsp;As
<i>men</i> (Job v.&nbsp;6, 7; H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I., 47&ndash;51);
2.&nbsp;As <i>Christians</i> (Ps. xxxiv.&nbsp;19). This
may seem strange to the natural man,
who concludes that the favourite of
Heaven is entitled to every indulgence
upon earth; and it has proved a
<span class="pagenum" id="p252">[p.&nbsp;252]</span>
source of temptation to the people of
God themselves, who have been led
from their sufferings to suspect their
safety. But this inference is unscriptural
(Heb. ii.&nbsp;10; Isa. liii.&nbsp;10; Matt.
x.&nbsp;25; Heb. xii.&nbsp;6; H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I., 189&ndash;196).
Could we view many of those who are
infinitely dear to God, we should find
them in a state of affliction, often exceedingly
trying; and we should see
them there, not hardening themselves
by infidel reasonings or stoical apathy;
not endeavouring to banish all sense
of their sorrows by repairing to the
dissipations of the world; but waiting
humbly upon God (Ps. lxi.&nbsp;1, 2; H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I.,
157, 158). This is well; but it is
not enough to <i>seek</i> God in our afflictions,
we must <i>serve</i> Him. Consider, then&mdash;</p>

<p>II. <span class="smcap">The duty here enjoined.</span>
<i>&ldquo;Glorify,&rdquo;</i> &amp;c. We cannot add to God&rsquo;s
essential glory, but we can declare it;
we can make it more fully and widely
known (Ps. xix.&nbsp;1). This is the duty
to which we are at all times called (1&nbsp;Pet.
ii.&nbsp;9). We discharge it in affliction,
when we verbally and practically
acknowledge&mdash;1.&nbsp;God&rsquo;s <i>agency,</i> recognising
that our trial has not come
upon us by accident, but by His appointment
or permission (Job ii.&nbsp;10;
H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I., 143; P.&nbsp;D., 92, 99). 2.&nbsp;His
<i>rectitude</i> (Ps. cxlv.&nbsp;17; Dan. ix.&nbsp;7; Ps.
cxix.&nbsp;75). 3.&nbsp;His <i>wisdom,</i> which regulated
His corrections and every circumstance
connected with them. He never
errs in the time, the place, the kind,
the instrument, the continuance of
affliction; it is precisely the very
thing we need, and nothing could be
altered without injury (H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I., 179&ndash;188).
4.&nbsp;His <i>goodness,</i> in sending the
affliction at all (H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I., 162&ndash;165),
and in the alleviations and compensations
by which it is accompanied (H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I.,
117&ndash;121). A grateful mind
will never overlook these. 5.&nbsp;His
<i>power,</i> to support us in the affliction,
and in due season to deliver us from
it. All the records of Scripture should
minister to our faith in His ability to
help and deliver; He is unchangeable;
He is as near you as He was to His
people of old; and you are as dear to
Him as they were (H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I., 198&ndash;202).</p>

<p>III. <span class="smcap">Reasons for discharging
the duty.</span> We ought to glorify God
in the fires&mdash;1.&nbsp;Because <i>it is our duty
to honour Him at all times, and affliction
cannot possibly exempt us from it.</i> Though
He has permitted affliction to come
upon us, He still remains our Creator,
our Preserver, our Benefactor, our Redeemer,
and as such is entitled to the
homage of our heart and life. 2.&nbsp;Because
<i>affliction furnishes one of the finest
opportunities</i> for honouring God (H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I.,
3692&ndash;3694). 3.&nbsp;<i>Hope should animate
us,</i> because it is distinctly declared
that those who honour God shall be
honoured by Him.</p>

<p>As the consequence of sanctifying
God in the fires, one of two things is
certain: either they will be removed, for
when the end is answered the dispensation
will cease; or you will be compensated
for their continuance, by increase
of grace, or the future recompense of
glory, or in both these ways combined.</p>

<p>But can we, who are so weak, perform
a duty so hard? No, <i>you</i> cannot
do it; but the grace of God will be
sufficient even for this. View your
difficulties in connection with your
supplies, God&rsquo;s commands in connection
with His promises, and boldly face
them all (Phil. iv.&nbsp;12, 13).&mdash;<i>William
Jay: Works,</i> vol. xii. pp. 159&ndash;169.</p>

<p class="gap" id="o206A">Glorify God&mdash;1.&nbsp;In the fires of persecution

<p class="bq">xxv.&nbsp;6&ndash;8. <i>And in this mountain, &amp;c.</i></p>

<p>The blessings of the Gospel are, with
wise adaptation to our views and feelings,
often compared to the objects
in which man naturally take most
delight; and here, as in other places,
they are compared to a costly entertainment
bestowed by the Sovereign
of the universe on the children of His
love. It was the custom of Oriental
monarchs on great occasions to make
rich feasts on a scale of magnificence,
of which we in the West can form
scarcely any idea (Esther
i.&nbsp;3&ndash;<span class="wsnw">7).<a id="o208_fna1" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#o208_fn1">[1]</a></span>
At these entertainments wise men
were often assembled, and important
questions in morals and literature were
discussed: hence the benefits of knowledge
and wisdom were often exhibited
under the image of a great feast (Prov.
ix.&nbsp;1&ndash;5). The prophet, as our Lord
Himself afterwards (Matt. xxii.&nbsp;1&ndash;3;
Luke xiv.&nbsp;16&ndash;24), speaks in accordance
with the habits of thinking common
in his time, when he sets forth the
blessings of the Gospel under the image
of a great feast.</p>

<p>I. <span class="smcap">A banquet of grace and salvation
spread for the needy</span> (ver.
6). 1.&nbsp;<i>It is a feast worthy of the Founder</i>
(Esther i.&nbsp;7). He who studies it most
closely, will be most struck by the
vastness of the resources and the magnificence
of the generosity of Him who
spread it. 2.&nbsp;<i>It is eminently a feast
of reconciliation and restored friendship.</i>
The feasts of the ancients were often
connected with sacrificial rites, were
employed to confirm covenants, and to
celebrate the reconciliation of those
who had been estranged and at enmity
with each other. We have an interesting
illustration of all this in what we
are told of Jacob and Laban (Gen.
xxxi.&nbsp;43&ndash;55). When Joseph was
about to reveal himself in love to his
brethren, and to unite them all in a new
bond of peace, he made a feast for
them (Gen. xliii.&nbsp;31&ndash;34). So did the
father of the prodigal, to testify the
perfectness of his reconciliation to his
guilty but penitent child (Luke xv.&nbsp;23).
The feast of which our text
speaks, is a feast founded upon a sacrifice;
it is a feast of reconciliation
effected by means of sacrifice; it is the
sublime and glorious realisation of the
ancient symbol of the feast that followed
upon the presentation of the
peace-offering (Lev. vii.&nbsp;11&ndash;16). It is
the fact that it is a feast of reconciliation
that gives sweetness and preciousness
to all the sweet and precious
things of which it is composed, just as
it was the fact that they symbolised
his restoration to his place in his
father&rsquo;s home and heart that made the
ring, and the robe, and all the choice
viands before him, delightful to the
pardoned prodigal (chap. xii.&nbsp;1; Rom.
v.&nbsp;1, 2, 11). 3.&nbsp;<i>Its magnificence and its
delightfulness are heightened by the number
of those who partake of it.</i> The rich
provisions of the Gospel are as widely
spread as they are widely needed.
This is a joy to the Christian, for to
a noble mind happiness multiplied is
happiness heightened.</p>

<p>II. <span class="smcap">Illumination for the ignorant</span>
(ver. 7). There was a symbolical
fulfilment of this prophecy in the
hour of our Saviour&rsquo;s death (Matt.
xxvii.&nbsp;51); that which had hidden the
<span class="pagenum" id="p254">[p.&nbsp;254]</span>
Holy of Holies from the sight of men
was rent in twain. A spiritual fulfilment
of it is the need of the world and
of each individual: by a veil of ignorance
and prejudice the truths which it
would be to their highest interest to
see clearly. This is declared concerning
the Jews (2&nbsp;Cor. iii.&nbsp;15), but it is
just as true of the majority of the
Gentiles: they also see no desirableness
in Christ, no preciousness in the
salvation He offers them. But this
destructive veil has been taken away
from the hearts of millions, and shall
yet be removed from the heart of a
vaster multitude&mdash;by the diffusion of
God&rsquo;s Word, the preaching of the Gospel,
and the accompanying agency of
the Holy Spirit. The preliminary fulfilment
of this prophecy at the day of
Pentecost (Acts ii.&nbsp;5, 41) shall have
still more glorious counterparts in the
not distant future.</p>

<p>III. <span class="smcap">Consolation for the sorrowing
and life for the dying</span> (ver. 8).</p>

<hr />

<p>This glorious prophecy is in the
course of fulfilment all around us; but
to us individually it may be as if God
had not been faithful to His Word.
We may have no appetite for spiritual
enjoyments, no craving for spiritual
blessings (Col. ii.&nbsp;18, 19). In this
case, so far as we are concerned, this
feast will have been spread in vain
(Luke xiv.&nbsp;18). If any man is conscious
that for him the Gospel has no
attractions, if he can listen to this prophecy
without a glow of thankful joy,
let him cry mightily to God for that
new heart without which all that God&rsquo;s
wonderful compassion has moved Him
to do for our race will leave him still
unblessed (H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I., 4090).&mdash;<i>Samuel Thodey.</i></p>

<p class="gap" id="o208A">This beautiful passage may be taken
as presenting some of the principal
aspects of the establishment of Christ&rsquo;s
kingdom upon the earth. It expresses
in a most lively manner the feelings of
hope and joy which the Gospel is naturally
fitted to call forth, and it unfolds
the Saviour&rsquo;s work to us under the ideas
of a <i>feast,</i> a <i>revelation,</i> and a <i>victory.</i></p>

<p><b>I. The Gospel speaks to men of a feast.</b>
It assumes that they are spiritually
destitute, in actual danger of perishing,
and it tells them of a feast. 1.&nbsp;A feast
<i>provided for all</i> (ver. 6). Christ came
not for the exclusive benefit of Jew or
Gentile; He came for <i>man</i> (Luke xix.&nbsp;10).
He invites all to share in the
blessings He has provided (Luke xiv.&nbsp;16),
and declares that the invitation
will not be given in vain (Matt. viii.&nbsp;11).
2.&nbsp;<i>A feast of the best things.</i> Suggested
here by the richness and flavour
of wines long preserved. We are apt
to miss the truth that the blessings
which the Gospel offers are of the richest
quality and of the highest value conceivable;
we act as if it required us
to give up a certain good for a doubtful
and visionary one. This accounts for
the eagerness with which men seek
first &ldquo;the world,&rdquo; regarding &ldquo;the kingdom
of God&rdquo; as something to be made
room for after all else has been obtained
(H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I., 5006, 5007).</p>

<p><b>II. The Gospel is a revelation to
men of God&rsquo;s gracious purposes</b> (ver. 7).
A thing may be a mystery to us in two
ways: because it is beyond all human
comprehension; or, because though it
is comprehensible a veil rests upon it.
In the former case the mystery must
ever remain what it is; in the latter,
the covering has only to be removed,
and the mystery is at an end. The
morning dispels the mystery of the
night. So the Gospel discloses eternal
truths of which man has no suspicion
(Eph. iii.&nbsp;2&ndash;12). The central, supreme
revelation of the Gospel is Christ; and
this is so because in Him God, who
had dwelt in thick darkness, stands
manifestly before us (John xiv.&nbsp;9; 1&nbsp;Tim.
iii.&nbsp;16; H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I. 855&ndash;857, 2241&ndash;2243).
In Him, too, man is for the first
time disclosed to himself; for the first
time he catches a glimpse of his nature,
of his relation to God, of his glorious
possibilities.</p>

<p><b>III. The Gospel speaks to man of
an eternal victory.</b> <i>&ldquo;He will swallow
up death in victory;&rdquo;</i> or &ldquo;He shall
utterly destroy death for ever.&rdquo; Here
<span class="pagenum" id="p255">[p.&nbsp;255]</span>
we have suggested to us the crowning
work of Christ (2&nbsp;Tim. i.&nbsp;10; Heb. ii.&nbsp;14).
In Him the believer has the
promise and pledge of a final and glorious
triumph. 1.&nbsp;<i>How great, then, should
be our confidence even in the midst of the
deepest affliction!</i> Doubts, fears, temptations
threaten to destroy us; but
with Christ strengthening us, our conflict
leads to certain victory. He who
has conquered will make us &ldquo;more
than conquerors.&rdquo; 2.&nbsp;<i>With what assurance,
therefore, should we approach the
hour of death itself!</i> By Him who
leads us on, death has been vanquished
and captured. Hence death is one
of our possessions (1&nbsp;Cor. iii.&nbsp;21&ndash;23).
Death, as in the old time men thought
of it, no longer exists; for the Christian
it is swallowed up in victory (H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I.,
1611&ndash;1614).&mdash;<i>William Manning.</i></p>

<p class="gap" id="o208B">The parable of the Great Supper
(Matt. xxii.&nbsp;1&ndash;14) illustrates this prophecy.
Consider&mdash;</p>

<p><b>I. The Founder of this feast:</b> &ldquo;the
Lord of hosts.&rdquo; <i>Hosts</i>&mdash;all creatures
in the universe, rational and irrational;
subject to His inspection; under His
control; designed for His glory. What
think you of the Founder of this feast?
What feast ever had such a Founder?
It is a feast worthy of its Founder.
How wonderful that He should condescend
to provide a feast for the world!</p>

<p><b>II. The nature of the feast.</b> Not
only the best, but the best of the
best; bountiful supply; rich variety.</p>

<p><b>III. The persons for whom this feast
has been prepared.</b> All may partake
of it; only those are excluded who
exclude themselves. 1.&nbsp;Are you making
excuses? Will your excuses stand
the test of the day of judgment? You
must partake, or perish! Delay not;
for, as far as you are concerned, the
feast will soon be over. Not now too
late; &ldquo;yet there is room.&rdquo; 2.&nbsp;Are you
participants? What present blessings;
what future glories! Bless the Founder&rsquo;s
Name. Seek to bring others to
the feast.&mdash;<i>Henry Creswell.</i></p>

<p class="gap" id="o208C">I. <span class="smcap">The Author of this feast.</span>
Not a prodigal, squandering the fruits
of the industry of others. Not a conqueror,
satiating admirers with spoils
unjustly acquired. Not a pompous
Ahasuerus, whose only design is to set
forth his own grandeur. God, moved
with compassion for rebels against His
authority; spreads a rich feast that
they may not perish.</p>

<p>II. <span class="smcap">The site of this feast.</span> <i>&ldquo;In
this mountain.&rdquo;</i> It is in the everlasting
Gospel this entertainment is prepared.
In coming to Christ for the pardon of
our sins and the salvation of our souls,
we come &ldquo;unto Mount Zion, the city
of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem.&rdquo;
The figure of a &ldquo;mountain&rdquo;
denotes the <i>elevation, security,</i> and <i>publicity</i>
of the Gospel feast. 1.&nbsp;Its <i>elevation.</i>
In coming to it, we leave all that
is debasing behind. 2.&nbsp;Its <i>security.</i> In
coming to it, we reach a place where we
may rejoice without fear (Luke i.&nbsp;71&ndash;75).
3.&nbsp;Its <i>publicity.</i> It is our own
fault if we do not see it and reach it.</p>

<p>III. <span class="smcap">The richness of this entertainment.</span>
<i>&ldquo;A feast of fat things, of
fat things full of marrow.&rdquo;</i> Carnal images
that set forth spiritual truths. In
the Gospel, and in the Gospel alone,
is found that which satisfies the hunger
of the soul and fills it with delight.</p>

<p>IV. <span class="smcap">The gladness of the entertainment.</span>
<i>&ldquo;A feast of wines on the
lees, of wines on the lees well refined.&rdquo;</i> A
figure founded on the influence of
wine on the human system (Ps. civ.&nbsp;15).
The Gospel, when rightly understood
and cordially embraced, makes
a heavy heart light. What can raise
men&rsquo;s spirits so high, or make them so
truly cheerful, as a sense that all their
sins are forgiven them? The joy of a
literal &ldquo;feast of wines&rdquo; is transient,
and after the midnight revel come
days of unpleasant reflection, reproach,
and melancholy. But the joy of the
Gospel is pure and permanent.</p>

<p>V. <span class="smcap">The extensiveness of the
entertainment.</span> It is &ldquo;unto all
people.&rdquo; Other entertainments may
be confined to the rich, the great, and
the noble; here all such distinctions
are done away. Christianity is a universal
religion, designed to redeem and
gladden the whole world. Its invitations
<span class="pagenum" id="p256">[p.&nbsp;256]</span>
are extended to all (Prov. ix.&nbsp;1&ndash;5;
Rev. xxii.&nbsp;17).&mdash;<i>William Reeve, M.A.,
Miscellaneous Discourses</i> (pp. 229&ndash;237).</p>

<p class="gap" id="o208D">I. <span class="smcap">The feast.</span> The blessings of the
Gospel are compared&mdash;1.&nbsp;To &ldquo;fat things
full of marrow.&rdquo; What are they?
Complete justification, adoption, the
sustaining confidence of being an object
of God&rsquo;s everlasting love&mdash;a love
which had no beginning and shall
have no end, union with Christ (and
all that great truth implies), the doctrine
of resurrection and everlasting
life. These are a few of the &ldquo;fat
things full of marrow&rdquo; which the
King of kings has set before His
guests. 2.&nbsp;To &ldquo;wines on the lees
well refined&rdquo;&mdash;symbols of the joys of
the Gospel; such a sense of perfect
peace with God, the sense of security,
communion with God, the pleasures of
hope, of hope that falls far short of
the reality. The description of the
wines&mdash;&ldquo;wines on the lees well refined&rdquo;&mdash;reminds
us that the joys of the
believer are ancient in their
<span class="wsnw">origin,<a id="o208_fna2" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#o208_fn2">[2]</a></span>
that they are most excellent in
their flavour and aroma, and that they
are pure and elevating in their nature.
The joys of grace are not fantastical
emotions, or transient flashes of meteoric
excitement; they are based on
substantial truth, are reasonable, fit
and proper, and make men like angels
(H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I., 1082, 3052, 3053).</p>

<p>II. <span class="smcap">The banqueting hall.</span> <i>&ldquo;In
this mountain.&rdquo;</i> There is a reference
here to three things, the same symbol
bearing three interpretations:&mdash;1.&nbsp;The
mountain on which Jerusalem is built.
On a little knoll of that mountain&mdash;Calvary&mdash;that
great transaction was
fulfilled which made to all nations a
great feast. 2.&nbsp;The Church. Frequently
Jerusalem is used as a symbol
of the Church of God, and it is within
the pale of the Church that the great
feast is made unto all nations. 3.&nbsp;The
Church of God exalted to the latter-day
glory. Then shall the glory of the
Gospel be unveiled more clearly and
enjoyed more fully than at present.</p>

<p>III. <span class="smcap">The host of the feast.</span>
<i>&ldquo;The Lord of hosts.&rdquo;</i> 1.&nbsp;The Lord
makes it, and makes it all. It is
utterly improper for us to bring anything
of our own to it; the Lord provides
even the wedding-garment in
which we are to sit at it, and no other
will be allowed. 2.&nbsp;Only the Lord of
hosts could have provided what man
needed. But He has done it, and
done it effectually. 3.&nbsp;As the Lord of
hosts has provided the feast, it is not
to be despised. To despise it will
show our folly, and involve us in great
guilt. 4.&nbsp;As He has provided all the
feast, let Him have all the glory.</p>

<p>IV. <span class="smcap">The guests.</span> <i>&ldquo;For all people.&rdquo;</i>
For all, irrespective of national, social,
intellectual, or even moral differences.
The declaration, &ldquo;for all people,&rdquo; gives
hope for all who wish to come. Between
the covers of the Bible there is
no mention of one person who may
not come, no description of one person
who may not trust in Christ. To
him who trusts Christ the whole feast
is open, there is not a blessing of
which he may not partake.&mdash;<i>C.&nbsp;H.
Spurgeon, Metropolitan Tabernacle Pulpit,</i>
No. 846.</p>

Alexander gave a feast after his return
from India of five days&rsquo; continuance, when
ninety marriages were celebrated and nine
thousand guests assembled. Diodorus Siculus
describes the festivities with which Antisthenes,
a rich citizen of Agrigentum (<span class="smcap">b.c.</span> 414), celebrated
the marriage of his daughter: all the
citizens of Agrigentum were entertained at
his expense on tables laid for them at their
own doors, beside a great number of strangers.
The festivities, as in the parable of the Ten
Virgins, took place in the evening, and the
whole city was one blaze of light. The Roman
and Egyptian banquets were proverbial
for their costliness and splendour. In Persia
still, royal banquets are prolonged for many
weeks; and a Chinese emperor used frequently
to make a feast that lasted a hundred and
twenty days.&mdash;<i>Thodey.</i></p></div>

<i>Old</i> wines are intended by &ldquo;wines well

have drawn out all the virtue from them, and
have been cleared of all the coarser material.
In the East, wine will be improved by keeping
even more than the wines of the West! and
even so the mercies of God are the sweeter to
our meditations because of their antiquity.
From old eternity, or ever the earth was, the
covenant engagements of everlasting love have
been resting like wines on the lees, and to-day
they bring to us the utmost riches of all
the attributes of God.&mdash;<i>Spurgeon.</i></p></div>

<h3 class="tdc" id="o209"><span class="smcap">The Triumphs of Christ.</span></h3>

<p class="bq">xxv.&nbsp;8. <i>He wil swallow up death in victory, &amp;c.</i></p>

<p>It is important at the very outset that
we should clearly recognise the Person
and the dignity of the Person of whom
all these things are declared. Otherwise
it will be impossible for us to look
for the fulfilment of these marvellous
promises. We have the authority of
St. Paul for declaring that the Person
is none other than our Lord Jesus
Christ. To <span class="smcap">Him</span> he ascribes the victory
over death (1&nbsp;Cor. xv.&nbsp;54). Thus St.
Paul authorises the most exalted conceptions
we can find of the dignity of
our Lord; for the work which he declares
will be fulfilled by Christ is in
our text ascribed to Jehovah: &ldquo;The
Lord God will wipe away,&rdquo; &amp;c. It is
of &ldquo;the Lord of hosts&rdquo; that Isaiah
speaks throughout (vers. 6&ndash;8). Thus
we have here one of the invaluable incidental
proofs with which Scripture
abounds of the deity of our Lord. If
He is &ldquo;the Lord of hosts,&rdquo; <i>then</i> we can
believe all the things here declared of
Him.</p>

<p><b>I. The deliverance of Christ&rsquo;s people
from death.</b> &ldquo;He will swallow up
death in victory&rdquo;&mdash;as the rods of the
magicians were swallowed up by the rod
of Aaron; as the hosts of Pharaoh were
swallowed up by the waters of the Red
Sea; as the darkness of the night is
swallowed up in the brightness of the
morning. True, God&rsquo;s people must
depart hence, like other people; but
in regard to them Christ &ldquo;has
swallowed up death in victory.&rdquo;
1.&nbsp;By imparting to them a spiritual life
and blessedness which are not touched
by the dissolution of the union of body
and soul. 2.&nbsp;By sustaining and comforting
them while that mysterious
process is being accomplished. How
often has the deathbed of the believer
been a scene of triumph! 3.&nbsp;By
utterly changing the character of death
in regard to them. To them it is not
a curse but a blessing (H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I., 1571&ndash;1594,
1594&ndash;1643). 4.&nbsp;By the promises
which on the morning of the
resurrection He will surely fulfil.
<span class="smcap">&ldquo;Then,&rdquo;</span> &amp;c. (1&nbsp;Cor. xv.&nbsp;54; H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I.,
4334&ndash;4354).</p>

<p><b>II. The deliverance of Christ&rsquo;s people
from sorrow.</b> &ldquo;The Lord God will
wipe away tears from off all faces,&rdquo;&mdash;tears
of sorrow for sin; of mourning
under affliction, trials, and bereavements;
of grief caused by the wickedness
of men and the injury done to the
cause of truth and righteousness: all
shall be wiped away, every cause of
sorrow brought to an end.</p>

<p><b>III. The deliverance of Christ&rsquo;s
people from the shame and contempt
of the world.</b>&mdash;<i>Samuel Thodey.</i></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 class="tdc" id="o210"><span class="smcap">A Sorrowless World.</span></h3>

<p class="bq">xxv.&nbsp;8. <i>And the Lord God will wipe away tears from off all faces.</i></p>

<p>The vision presented is that of a
sorrowless world; a vision which has
haunted the imagination of men in
every age. The Bible declares that
that which has been merely a bright
but disappearing dream shall be a
glorious fact.</p>

<p><b>I. Look at sorrow as a fact.</b> How
early we become acquainted with it.
How our experience of it increases
with every year of life. How numerous
are its sources. How inevitable it is
(H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I., 47&ndash;50). But the profoundest,
heaviest, most oppressive, and most
enduring sorrow of which we are
capable is the sorrow of the soul which
is caused by consciousness of guilt.
Unlike all other sorrows, in the thought
of death it finds no relief; by that
thought it is unspeakably aggravated
(H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I., 1334&ndash;1341; P.&nbsp;D., 1664, 1668).</p>

<p><b>II. Proceed to look at God removing
sorrow.</b> &ldquo;The Lord God will wipe
away tears from off all faces.&rdquo; How
great the enterprise! Yet how sufficient,
though unexpected and startling,
is the agency He employs: on this
mission of mercy He has sent His own
<span class="pagenum" id="p258">[p.&nbsp;258]</span>
Son. God as His manner is, works
from within outwards; He not only
wipes off all tears, He removes their
cause. That cause is sin. But how
does He destroy sin in the human
soul? 1.&nbsp;By revealing it, by showing
its essential hideousness&mdash;one of the
revelations of the cross of Christ. It
is not until we perceive the costliness
of the atonement of sin, that we begin
to suspect its terribleness and hatefulness.
2.&nbsp;By showing that sin can be
conquered. This is the glorious message
and proclamation of the life of
the Man Christ Jesus. 3.&nbsp;By furnishing
a motive that shall stimulate us to
the conflict with sin which will end in
victory. That motive is found in the
love for Christ which springs up in
the soul when we view Him dying on
the cross in our stead. 4.&nbsp;In the same
marvellous spectacle we see that which
alone can pacify conscience, and which
does pacify it. Believing, our fears and
our sorrows flee away; our mourning
is turned into joy. The supreme need
of the soul is met in reconciliation
with God. A sorrowless life is begun.
But that is not all. Having destroyed&mdash;<i>in</i>
destroying sin in the soul, God
implants righteousness (chap. xxxii.&nbsp;17).
He creates as well as destroys. He
introduces into our thoughts, words,
actions, a Divine order, and therefore
a Divine beauty and blessedness. All
sorrow springs from infractions of this
order; this is seen in national, social,
individual life. In proportion as it is
restored, tears are wiped away. The
great Agent by whom this work is
accomplished is His own Spirit; but
He works by means, and the chief instruments
He employs are those who, in
various ways, are promoting the knowledge
and practice of the will of God in
the world. In this work we may share;
this possibility is the glory of our life.
By the progress of Christian truth,
how many tears have been already
wiped away! In spite of every obstacle,
the glorious work shall proceed,
with ever-accelerating triumphs. There is a
better day dawning for our race (H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I.,
3421&ndash;3423). Nothing can bring it
in but the Gospel. All other agencies&mdash;commerce,
education, literature, art,
legislation&mdash;have been tried and have
failed. He who loves humanity will
consecrate himself to the furtherance
of the Gospel; and he who does so
shall share in that joy of redeeming
the world from sin and sorrow by the
hope of which Christ was sustained
amid the sufferings He endured for
this great end.&mdash;<i>Thomas Neave.</i></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 class="tdc" id="o211"><span class="smcap">Advent Thoughts and Joys.</span></h3>

<p class="bq">xxv.&nbsp;9. <i>And it shall be said in that day, &amp;c.</i></p>

<p>Isaiah is here, as he is so often,
the prophet not merely of future
events, but of future states of mind
and feeling; not merely of God&rsquo;s
dealings with His people, but of the
way in which they would or should
meet their God.</p>

<p>To what event does he refer?</p>

<p>1. First of all, to the deliverance of
Hezekiah and his people from King
<span class="wsnw">Sennacherib.<a id="o211_fna1" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#o211_fn1">[1]</a></span>
That deliverance was recognised as God&rsquo;s work. The recognition
of God&rsquo;s presence in the great
turning-points of human history is in
all ages natural to religious minds.
He is with men and nations at all
times, but in the great crises of history
that presence is brought more
vividly before the imagination. So
was it when a great storm destroyed
the Spanish Armada, and when the
power of the first Napoleon was
broken first at Leipsic and then at
Waterloo. Devout minds felt that
these were reappearances of God in
human history, and they rejoiced in
Him.</p>

<p>2. But beyond the immediate present,
Isaiah sees, it may be indistinctly,
into a distant future. The
judgment of his time foreshadowed
some universal judgment upon all the
enemies of mankind, some deliverance
final, universal, at the end of time.
For that judgment and deliverance the
Church, both on earth and in heaven,
<span class="pagenum" id="p259">[p.&nbsp;259]</span>
waits and prays (Ps. lxxiv.&nbsp;10, 22, 23;
Rev. vi.&nbsp;9, 10). To them the answer
seems to be long delayed; but it will
come (Rev. vi.&nbsp;12&ndash;17); and when at
last it bursts upon the world, it will
be welcomed by the servants of God
as was the deliverance of Jerusalem
from the Assyrian army.</p>

<p>3. But between the days of Hezekiah
and the final judgment there is
another event closer to the prophet&rsquo;s
thought&mdash;the appearance of the great
Deliverer in the midst of human history.
All that belongs to the nearer
history of Judah melts away in the
future which belongs to the King
Messiah. The Assyrians themselves
are replaced in his thoughts by the
greater enemies of humanity; the city
of David and Mount Zion become the
spiritual city of God, the mountain of the
Lord of hosts, the Church of the
Divine Redeemer. Here, as so often,
the incarnation of the eternal Son of
God, with its vast and incalculable
consequences to the world of souls, is
the keynote of Isaiah&rsquo;s deepest thought,
and in our text he epitomises the
heart-song of Christendom, which
ascends day by day to the throne of
the Redeemer. (1.)&nbsp;<i>&ldquo;Lo, this is our
God.&rdquo;</i> Christ is not for us Christians
merely or chiefly the preacher or
herald of a religion of which another
being, distinct from Himself, is its
object. The Gospel creed does not
run thus, &ldquo;There is no God but God,
and Christ is His prophet.&rdquo; When He
appears to the soul of man at the
crisis of its penitence, or its conversion,
the greeting which meets and befits
Him is not, &ldquo;Lo, this is the good man
sent for God to teach some high and
forgotten moral truths;&rdquo; no, but, &ldquo;Lo,
this is our God; we have waited for
Him; He will save us!&rdquo; (H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I.,
835&ndash;845). (2.)&nbsp;So might the Jews, the
children of the prophets, have sung;
so did some of those who entered most
deeply into the meaning of the promises
given to their fathers (Luke i.&nbsp;46&ndash;55,
68&ndash;79; ii.&nbsp;29&ndash;32). (3.)&nbsp;So
might the noble philosophers of Greece
have sung; so they did sing when, in
Christ the incarnate God, of whom
they had dreamed and for whom they
had sought, was revealed to them.
(4.)&nbsp;So have sung in all ages that
multitude of human souls whom a
profound sense of moral need has
brought to the feet of the Redeemer
(H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I., 948&ndash;971).&mdash;<i>H.&nbsp;P. Liddon,
M.A.: Christian World Pulpit,</i> vol.
xiii. pp. 1&ndash;3.</p>

<p class="gap" id="o211A">I. <span class="smcap">What are those comings of
Christ which are the occasion of
joy to the Church?</span> 1.&nbsp;<i>His coming
in the flesh,</i> His incarnation. To this
His people had looked forward; in it
they rejoiced. Good cause had they
for gladness, for He came to spread
the gospel feast, to remove the clouds
of ignorance and error, to destroy the
reign of sin and death. 2.&nbsp;<i>His coming
in the Spirit,</i> at the day of Pentecost;
in the experience of the individual
soul, in the hours of penitence, of
temptation, of sorrow. His coming in
the flesh was the great promise of the
Old Testament; His coming in the
Spirit is the great promise of the New.
3.&nbsp;<i>His coming to receive the soul to glory.</i>
He comes unchanged. Precious in the
sight of the Lord is the death of His
saints. 4.&nbsp;<i>His coming to bring the present
dispensation to a close.</i> It may be
heralded by many alarming and distressing
events, but it will be itself a
cause for joy. To the wicked it will
be a day of unmixed terror, but to the
righteous of gladness; for it will bring
them redemption from the power of
every sin, from the assault of every
enemy; every fetter will be broken,
every cloud dispelled.</p>

<p>II. <span class="smcap">What is requisite to enable
us to welcome the approach of
Christ?</span> 1.&nbsp;A knowledge of Him as
our God and Redeemer. 2.&nbsp;An experience
of the benefits of His salvation.
3.&nbsp;Love for Him. 4.&nbsp;Submission
to His will and zeal for his glory.&mdash;<i>Samuel Thodey.</i></p>

<p class="gap" id="o211B"><b>I. In the day of judgment nothing
will inspire us with joy and confidence
but a real interest in Jesus Christ.</b>
The ungodly now possess many sources
<span class="pagenum" id="p260">[p.&nbsp;260]</span>
of present enjoyment; but in that day
they will have ceased for ever. One
grand, all-important idea will then fill
the mind: &ldquo;The solemn day of account
is come; how shall I abide in it?
How shall I endure the presence of
the heart-searching Judge?&rdquo; But
whence can this assurance be obtained?
Only from an interest in Jesus Christ.
Those who do not possess it will
then be filled with shame and terror;
but, amid all its terrors, those who
do possess it will be enabled to rejoice.</p>

<p><b>II. In that day none will be found
to have a real interest in Christ, nor
capable of rejoicing, but those who are
now waiting for His coming.</b> This is
a characteristic of all genuine Christians
(1&nbsp;Thess. i.&nbsp;10; Tit. ii.&nbsp;13; 1&nbsp;Cor.
i.&nbsp;7; Luke xii.&nbsp;36). Hence, in
our text, we find the saints representing
their conduct towards the Lord in
the days of their flesh by the same
term: &ldquo;We have waited for Him.&rdquo;
It may be useful, then, to point out
some of the particulars implied in this
general description of the Christian
character. To &ldquo;wait for Christ&rdquo;
implies&mdash;1.&nbsp;<span class="smcap">A
firm belief in his second
coming,</span> and of the infinitely momentous
consequences which will follow
that event. The true Christian walks
&ldquo;by faith, not by sight.&rdquo; Unlike the
profane (2&nbsp;Pet. iii.&nbsp;4), he lays it down
in his mind as an infallible truth that
&ldquo;the day of the Lord <i>will</i> come.&rdquo;
2.&nbsp;<span class="smcap">A constant endeavour to be prepared
for it.</span> How the wise virgins acted
(Matt. xxv.&nbsp;4). 3.&nbsp;<span class="smcap">A patient continuance
in well-doing</span> (Luke xii.&nbsp;35&ndash;46).
Are you <i>thus</i> &ldquo;waiting&rdquo; for the
second coming of your Lord?&mdash;<i>Edward
Cooper: Practical and Familiar Sermons,</i>
vol. iv. pp. 225&ndash;240.</p>

<p class="gap" id="o211C">The chapter from which these words
are taken contains a noble description
of the glory and grace of God, of
His glory in ruling irresistibly the nations
of the earth, and in crushing the
enemies of His Church, of His glory
and grace in the salvation of mankind.
It records by anticipation the triumphs
of the Gospel, the downfall of the
powers of darkness, the annihilation
of death itself, the reign of perpetual
peace and joy.</p>

<p><b>I. A recognition of the birth of
the Messiah.</b> It is a matter of historical
certainty that the people of
God did wait for the coming of the
Saviour from the time of the very
first promise given to the woman after
the fall, to the period of our Lord&rsquo;s
appearance upon the earth, at which
season there was a general expectation
in all the neighbouring regions
of the advent of some mighty personage
who was to realise all the sublime
descriptions of the ancient prophets.
Anna the prophetess, Joseph of Arimathea,
the aged Simeon and other
devout men, were waiting for the
&ldquo;consolation of Israel.&rdquo;</p>

<p><b>II. An assertion of His Divinity.</b>
&ldquo;This is our God,&rdquo;&mdash;not merely a
prophet, a priest, a king, chosen by
Jehovah from among His people, and
commissioned to give laws and statutes,
as Moses was, or to assert Jehovah&rsquo;s
authority and punish idolatry,
as Elijah was, or to denounce His
wrath against an apostate people and
at the same time to foreshadow a
great deliverance to come, as Isaiah
was himself, or Jeremiah or any other
of those holy men who spake in old
times by the Holy Ghost; but this is
<span class="smcap">our God,</span> this is Emmanuel&mdash;God
with us&mdash;God manifest in the flesh.</p>

<p><b>III. A declaration of His atoning
work.</b> How vast that work He
took on Himself to execute,&mdash;the reconciliation
in His own person of
sinful man to an offended God, the
overthrow of the kingdom of Satan,
and the abolition of death! No man
could have performed it (Ps. xlix.&nbsp;7).
Could any of the angels, then, have
taken in hand this enterprise? Beyond
the power, above the conception
of any being of limited goodness,
knowledge and power, it could only
be accomplished by the Divine Son
of God. It was God&rsquo;s work, devised
and executed by Omnipotence.</p>

<p><b>IV. A recognition of the second
coming of Christ.</b> We are admonished
by the Church that there is a
<span class="pagenum" id="p261">[p.&nbsp;261]</span>
Second Coming of Christ, for which
the Church is waiting, and for which
we, with every member of the Church,
ought to be looking with earnest and
anxious expectation. Is our language,
&ldquo;How long, O Lord?&rdquo; Our answer
is, How long the final triumph of the
Saviour may be deferred, how long a
period may elapse before the world is
ripe for judgment, is one of those secrets
which God has reserved to Himself
(Acts i.&nbsp;7). The end of all things,
it may be not in the literal sense of the
word, at hand, is every year and every
day and every moment drawing nearer
to each of us. We are all in silent
but unceasing movement towards the
judgment-hall of Christ. In this point
of view, the moment of our death may
be regarded as placing us at once before
His awful tribunal, for the space
between the two, as it affects our
eternal destination, will be to us as
nothing. When the judgment is set,
the books opened, we shall suddenly
stand before the Judge, precisely in
that state of preparation in which we
were found at the moment of our departure
out of life. Those who have
lived as children of God, as servants
of Jesus Christ, under the solemn, yet
not fearful, expectation of that day,
will then be able to lift up their
heads and raise the song of joyful
recognition.</p>

<p><i>Application.</i>&mdash;If ever there was a
great practical truth, this is one. If
we do not wait for the great day of
the Lord in such a spirit of carefulness
and circumspection as to refer to it all
our actions, words, and thoughts, then
it is perfectly certain that we shall be
surprised at its coming and be taken
utterly unprepared. It will come on
us as a thief in the night, and we
shall sink into everlasting perdition;
not for the want of means and opportunities
of being saved, but for want
of common prudence and forethought
in the most momentous of all concerns.
What, then is the conclusion?
Live like men that are waiting
for their Lord, then when He
arrives, He may be welcomed. Accustom
yourselves to His presence, in
His sanctuary, at His table, in His
word, in secret communings with Him
in the temple of a purified heart. So
when this solemn day shall have come
the glad response may be, &ldquo;Lo, this
is our God, we have waited for Him;
He will come and save us!&rdquo;&mdash;<i>C.&nbsp;J.

It was no ordinary day that saw the
discomfiture of the Assyrian host before the
walls of Jerusalem. We can scarcely understand
the terror and dismay with which a
religious Jew must have watched the growth
of those mighty Oriental despotisms which,
rising one after the other in the valley of the
Euphrates and of the Tigris, aspired to
nothing less than the conquest of the known
world. The victory of a conqueror like Sennacherib
meant the extinction of national life
and of personal liberty in the conquered
people; it meant often enough violent transportation
from their homes, separation from
their families, with all the degrading and
penal accompaniments of complete subjugation.
It meant this to the conquered pagan
cities; for Jerusalem it meant this and more.
The knowledge and worship of God, by institutions
of Divine appointment, maintained only in
that little corner of the wide world, were
linked on to the fortunes of the Jewish state,
and in the victory of Sennacherib would be
involved not merely political humiliation, but
religious darkness. When, then, his armies
advanced across the continent again and again,
making of a city a heap, and of a fenced city
a ruin, and at last appeared before Jerusalem,
when the blast of the terrible men was as a
storm against the wall, there was natural dismay
in every religious and patriotic soul. It
seemed as though a veil or covering, like that
which was spread over the holy things in the
Jewish ritual, was being spread more and more
completely over all nations at each step of the
Assyrian monarch&rsquo;s advance, and in those
hours of darkness all true-hearted men in
Jerusalem waited for God. He had delivered
them from Egyptian slavery; He had
given them the realm of David and Solomon.
He who had done so much for them would
not desert them now. In His own way He
would rebuke this insolent enemy of his truth
and His people, and this passionate longing
for His intervention quickened the eye and
welled the heart of Jerusalem when at last it
came. The destruction of Sennacherib&rsquo;s host
was one of those supreme moments in the history
of a people which can never be lived over
again by posterity. The sense of deliverance
was proportioned to the agony which had preceded
it. To Isaiah and his contemporaries it
seemed as though a canopy of thick darkness
was lifted from the face of the world, as
though the recollections of slaughter and of
death were entirely swallowed up in the absorbing
sense of deliverance, as though the
<span class="pagenum" id="p262">[p.&nbsp;262]</span>
tears of the city had been wiped away and the
rebuke of God&rsquo;s people was taken from earth,
and therefore from the heart of Israel there
burst forth a welcome proportioned to the
anxious longing that had preceded it, &ldquo;Lo,
this is our God; we have waited for Him;
He will save us.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Liddon.</i></p></div>

<p class="bq">xxv.&nbsp;10. <i>For in this mountain shall the hand of the Lord rest.</i></p>

<p>&ldquo;Rest!&rdquo; As a father&rsquo;s hand on
the head of his first-born, blessing and
protecting his child. That mountain
is impregnable which rests under the
shadow of God&rsquo;s hand.</p>

<p><b>I. Of every enterprise we should
ask, &ldquo;Is it right?&rdquo;</b> If wickedness
be in &ldquo;the mountain,&rdquo; God&rsquo;s protecting
hand will not rest upon it. A
just cause creates a good conscience,
and hence inspires strength. It is
only the just man who feels that God
&ldquo;teaches his hands to war and his
fingers to fight, so that a bow of steel
is broken by his arms.&rdquo; &ldquo;The righteous
is bold as a lion.&rdquo; The good
man can patiently wait and confidently

<p><b>III. Forts and castles, ironclads
and armies, can never save an unrighteous
nation from decay.</b> National
selfishness, oppressive enterprises,
weaken the strongest defences,
corrupt the richest treasurers. Babylon
became a marsh, Nineveh a forsaken
mound, Tyre a deserted rock. In the
Colosseum at Rome where martyrs
bled, the fox, the bat, and the owl
now make their home. The walls of
Moab were levelled with the dust.
By justice only can peoples be strong.

lasting as the hills.&mdash;<i>William Parkes.</i></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 class="tdc" id="o213"><span class="smcap">Days of Deliverance.</span></h3>

<p class="bq">xxvi.&nbsp;1&ndash;2. <i>In that day shall this song be sung, &amp;c.</i></p>

<p>There are days in the history of
God&rsquo;s people when they specially need
His interposing power. This is their
prayer (Ps. xxx.&nbsp;10). This their glad
confession (Ps. xc.&nbsp;17). As such seasons
of direct deliverance the natural
expression of the heart is one of gladness.
If the poetic faculty be strong
within them, as in the case of the king
of Israel, they sing in lyric splendour,
as in Psalm xviii.</p>

<p>1. <i>That historic period referred to by
the prophet Isaiah in this chapter was
such a day.</i> They had been marvellously
protected from the invading
Assyrian. His host had been smitten
as by the blast of the Lord. When
from the city walls they saw the thin
relics of that grand army hasten away,
then would this song of salvation be
echoed through the city. When under
the imperial protection of Cyrus the
exiles returned to their own land,
that was another day of deliverance.
They rebuilt the temple and renewed
the temple service. Then they sang
in their own land, the land of Judah,
the songs of Zion.</p>

<p>2. <i>But the first great event in their
history,</i> the birthday of their nation,
their deliverance from Egyptian bondage,
was specially memorable as &ldquo;that
day.&rdquo; And in every subsequent national
deliverance from the times of
the Judges, all through the splendid
leadership of David and the heroic
days of the Maccabean brothers, that
first deliverance seemed to be renewed,
and the old song from the Red Sea
shore was again chanted (Ex. xv.&nbsp;6).</p>

<p>3. <i>In the infant days of the Primitive
Church,</i> meeting then in the upper
room in Jerusalem, when its two
<span class="pagenum" id="p263">[p.&nbsp;263]</span>
leaders, Peter and John, were seized
and confronted with &ldquo;their rulers, and
elders, and scribes,&rdquo; and sternly threatened
&ldquo;not to speak at all or teach
in the name of Jesus.&rdquo; That was a
day of deliverance. Then was seen
how gloriously transformed were these
two Galilean fishermen under the inspiration
of the Kingdom of Christ,
how sublimely fit they were to lead
the forlorn hope of the Church through
the breach of Judaism and heathenism
on to the conquest of the world. See
Acts iv.&nbsp;19, 20, 23, 24. How deeply
and rapturously impressed was that
little church with the conviction that
the power of Him who had made heaven
and earth was then resting on their
own chiefs, and making them bold to
speak <i>&ldquo;His name.&rdquo;</i> They shook the
very walls of the room with the volume
of their song: &ldquo;We have a strong
city; salvation will God appoint for
walls and bulwarks.&rdquo;</p>

<p>4. Another day of deliverance came
to the early Church, <i>when the cry of
the primitive martyrs was heard</i> (Rev. vi.&nbsp;9, 10).
That &ldquo;little season&rdquo; soon
passed, and their cry was answered;
rest came to the martyred Church.
No more holy men were thrown to the
lions, no more delicate women thrust
into caldrons of boiling pitch; the
sword slept in its scabbard, and crucifixions
were ended. Then the churches
had rest, and this hymn was joyously
sung. Since those early centuries,
God&rsquo;s Church has passed through
many a fiery furnace, and has come
out all the purer and all the stronger.
And many a song of deliverance has
floated up to heaven.</p>

<p>5. This season of gladness has been
realised by God&rsquo;s people individually.
(1.)&nbsp;<i>When a consciousness of the forgiveness
of sins has come.</i> When in the
temple of the soul this voice has been
heard: &ldquo;Thy sins are forgiven thee;
go in peace.&rdquo; (2.)&nbsp;<i>When the child of
God has been delivered from some dark
calamity, so threatening that no human
help could deliver.</i> (3.)&nbsp;<i>But the grandest
deliverance is the final one.</i> The best
wine is kept for the last cup. When
the death-river is crossed, and the
crystal gates respond to the command,
&ldquo;Open ye the gates, that the righteous
nation which keepeth the truth may
enter in.&rdquo; Then when this corruption
has put on incorruption, and
this mortal has put on immortality,
when standing within that city where
the wicked cease from troubling and
the weary are at rest, will the redeemed
of the Lord shout this song
as never before: &ldquo;We have a strong
city, salvation will God appoint for
walls and bulwarks.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>William Parkes.</i></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 class="tdc" id="o214"><span class="smcap">Perfect Peace.</span></h3>

<p class="bq">xxvi.&nbsp;3&ndash;4. <i>Thou wilt keep him in perfect peace, &amp;c.</i></p>

<p>Our text points to the infallible
remedy for the worst of all forms of
human ills, a burdened and disconsolate
spirit&mdash;&ldquo;perfect peace.&rdquo;</p>

<p><b>I. The Author of this peace is
none other than God Himself.</b> The
mind of man is too active and capacious
ever to find rest, unless it be
in its Maker. This is the testimony
of experience as well as of
Scripture. Earthly honours, riches,
friendships, leave the heart devoid of
enduring peace, because they can do
nothing to dispel the sense of guilt
and the consequent apprehensions of
the future which ever and anon disturb
those who possess them most
abundantly. We cannot have peace
unless we have God for our portion.
But how can God, the righteous governor
of the universe, be at peace
with us sinners? To this question a
complete and glorious answer is found
in the Gospel, and there only. God
Himself, at infinite cost, has opened
a way of peace by which we may return
to Him. Peace is offered to all
who will receive it as His gift, through
our Lord Jesus Christ; but only from
Him and thus can it be obtained.</p>

<p><b>II. The peace which God imparts
to His people is &ldquo;perfect.&rdquo;</b> 1.&nbsp;In
<span class="pagenum" id="p264">[p.&nbsp;264]</span>
its <i>source.</i> This determines its quality.
The laws of the human mind are such
that our happiness will partake of the
character of the object from which it
is derived. If it be from an uncertain
and unsatisfying world, <i>it</i> will be just
as uncertain and unsatisfying; if from
the eternal and immutable God, <i>it</i> will
be undisturbable. As to both his temporal
and eternal necessities, the believer&rsquo;s
Helper is omnipresent and all-merciful.
What, then, can he fear (Ps. xxvii.&nbsp;1)?
2.&nbsp;In its <i>measure.</i> It rises like a river,
and swells and rolls onward until it
bears sin and sorrow away into the
land of forgetfulness. 3.&nbsp;In its <i>adaptation
to our needs.</i> These do but afford
the occasions for its triumphs.
It comes in when all other joys go
out, and erects its brightest monuments
on the ruins of earthly hopes.
There is no trial which it cannot
enable us to <span class="wsnw">endure.<a id="o214_fna1" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#o214_fn1">[1]</a></span>
No wonder that Jesus calls it His peace (John xiv.&nbsp;27),
and bequeaths it to His disciples
as the best legacy which it is
in His power to bestow. That very
repose in God which so filled and
cheered His own bosom He delights
to share with all who love Him.</p>

<p><b>III. If this perfect peace is to be
ours, we must link ourselves on to
God by a simple, earnest, childlike
faith.</b> As sinners we must begin by
the exercise of a personal faith in His
Son as our Saviour. 1.&nbsp;This is <i>essential.</i>
Nothing else will answer the purpose.
Whatsoever was the strength
of the ark built by Noah, or its fitness
to float on the water, it could save
from the deluge those only who entered
it; and so Christ&rsquo;s death on the
cross to procure peace for us will avail
us nothing unless through Him we
seek reconciliation with God. 2.&nbsp;This
is <i>sufficient.</i> Let this be done in the
first instance, and be repeated as often
as clouds overcast the mind and doubts
arise in the heart, and there can be nothing
to hinder the enjoyment of peace.
Nothing more is needed. Once let a
simple trust in the merits of the Saviour
take possession of the bosom,
and it will go further to produce
abiding tranquillity than all the tears
and vigils of the most perfect devotee.
The peace thus coming to us will
never end. Let the penitent sinner
but stay himself on the Lord and
trust in God of his salvation, and
though he &ldquo;walk in darkness, and see
no light,&rdquo; he is just as safe for both
worlds as the power and grace of God
can make him.</p>

<p><b>IV. We have to acknowledge that
many who hope for salvation through
Christ are not possessed of &ldquo;perfect
peace.&rdquo;</b> Many believers are &ldquo;in heaviness
through manifold temptations,&rdquo;
and their peace is more like an uncertain
brook than a perpetual river
moving calmly into the ocean. Why
is this? 1.&nbsp;Sometimes, though rarely,
because God has been pleased to withdraw
the blessed feeling of undisturbed
tranquillity, in order that He
may produce a deeper sense of dependence
on Him. In such cases, peace
will be reached again through humble
submission to the Divine will concerning
us, and trust in the unchangeableness
of the Divine love. We must not
give way to despondency. We must
be on the alert to hear God speaking
comfort to us through His Word.
2.&nbsp;Sometimes the believer&rsquo;s peace is interrupted
by a derangement of the
physical or mental system. Let us
remember that while we are in the
flesh we are liable to such trials, and
that our salvation does not depend
on our feelings, which are changeable
as the clouds, but on the Rock of
Ages. 3.&nbsp;Sometimes we permit our
attention to be turned away from God
and engrossed by our trials. It is
with us as with Peter (Matt. xiv.&nbsp;30).
But then, like him, let us cry to the
Lord, let us obey the exhortation of
our text, and we shall find that He
can give us both deliverance and peace.
4.&nbsp;Sometimes, alas! we forget that the
faith to which peace is promised is a
faith that shows itself in &ldquo;patient
continuance in well-doing&rdquo; (Rom. ii.&nbsp;7;
James ii.&nbsp;26). Let us not be surprised
if, then, our peace departs.
Let us return unto the Lord, and beseech
Him to heal our backslidings.
<span class="pagenum" id="p265">[p.&nbsp;265]</span>
Restored to the paths of righteousness,
we shall find that they, and
they alone, are &ldquo;paths of peace.&rdquo;</p>

<p><b>V. It is the duty, as it is the privilege,
of all believers to seek for &ldquo;perfect
peace.&rdquo;</b> With any lower measure
of this blessing, we should not be content.
1.&nbsp;Without it, we cannot possess
the comfort which God desires that all
His people should enjoy. 2.&nbsp;Without
it, we cannot help our fellow-men as
we ought. It is our duty to reveal to
them the power of the grace of God;
and in few ways can we so effectually
stimulate our fellow-men to seek Him
whom they need, as by manifesting
that tranquillity they so much desire,
and can find only in Him. 3.&nbsp;Without
it, we cannot glorify God as we ought.
What we <i>are</i> should move onlookers
to praise Him, as a lovely landscape
uplifts the thoughts of beholders to
the Creator of all; but this can be only
when the purposes of God in regard
to us are fulfilled, and we are rejoicing
in the possession of purity and &ldquo;perfect
peace.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>David Magie, D.D.: American
National Preacher,</i> vol. xxv. pp.
221&ndash;231.</p>

<p class="gap" id="o214A"><b>I. All true spiritual peace originates
in reconciliation with God.</b> The grand
object of the Gospel is to bring about
this peace (Luke ii.&nbsp;14). Jesus Christ
is designated &ldquo;the Prince of peace;&rdquo;
the Father, &ldquo;the God of peace.&rdquo; God
is really reconciled, <i>i.e.,</i> is peaceably
disposed towards us, &ldquo;waiting to be
gracious;&rdquo; but men are not reconciled,
not willing to renounce their rebellion
and yield themselves to Him. They
can have no true peace until they cast
away their sins and cast themselves
on the Divine mercy, as it is offered to
us in and through Jesus Christ. But
doing this, it and all other spiritual
blessings shall be theirs (Isa. lv.&nbsp;7;
Rom. v.&nbsp;1).</p>

<p><b>II. We attain to true spiritual peace
precisely in proportion as we attain to
perfect harmony with the Divine will.</b>
When we first become at peace with
one with whom we have previously
been at variance, it does not follow
that we can at once fall in with all
that is required of his household,
however justly. So the peace of the
regenerated man is not at first perfect,
because his submission to the Divine
will is only partial. Afterwards,
when he can truly say of all God&rsquo;s
proceedings, &ldquo;Thy will be done,&rdquo; and
his mind is fully &ldquo;stayed on God,&rdquo;
even when perils threaten and sharp
sacrifices are demanded, then his peace
&ldquo;flows like a river,&rdquo; and grows into
&ldquo;the peace of God which passeth all
understanding.&rdquo;</p>

<p><b>III. All true spiritual peace is supernatural
in its origin.</b> To grant this
deep and abiding peace is the prerogative
of the Divine Saviour. Friends
may leave us houses, lands, gold, but
only Christ can give us peace (John
xiv.&nbsp;27). &ldquo;My peace!&rdquo; What is
Christ&rsquo;s peace? Not the peace of reconciliation,
for with God He never
was at variance (Heb. iv.&nbsp;15; 1&nbsp;Pet.
ii.&nbsp;22). &ldquo;My peace&rdquo; could only mean
that mental peace which flows from
perfect harmony with the Divine will.
Such peace can come to us only through
the educational power of Christ. The
more we obey the Master, the more
implicit will be our submission to God,
and the deeper our peace. Only then
shall we know &ldquo;perfect peace.&rdquo; Such
peace, like every Christian grace and
holy virtue, being beyond the reach of
nature, is supernatural (James i.&nbsp;17).
The child of God, calm amid a tempest
of trouble, often excites the wonder of
the world. Such quietness of soul is
not the result of temperament or of
training. It is God&rsquo;s work: &ldquo;<i>Thou</i>
wilt keep,&rdquo; &amp;c.</p>

<p><b>IV. All true spiritual peace is practical
in its results.</b> Though in its
Divine creation it is &ldquo;past finding
out,&rdquo; it is not a mystical rapture, a
thing in the clouds; it is a reality, a
living principle arousing itself for the
battle, and standing on the watchtower
amid the struggles and trials of
daily life (Phil. iv.&nbsp;7; R.&nbsp;V.) As a
garrison seizes and retains a stronghold,
so &ldquo;the peace of God&rdquo; takes
military possession of the soul, and
beats off all outside assailants. It has
an active as well as a passive side, like
<span class="pagenum" id="p266">[p.&nbsp;266]</span>
a staff which we can draw forth for a
fight as well as lean on for rest. 1.&nbsp;It
protects the <i>mind.</i> Sceptical thoughts,
atheistic objects, may invade the
mind and perplex the reason, but then
we fall back on this peace. We <i>know</i>
that we are never so calm and strong
as when we obey the will of God, and
keep conscience on our side. Rectitude
bringing peace, is an evidence of
the divinity of our religion stronger
than any sceptical objection that can
be brought against it. 2.&nbsp;It protects
the <i>heart.</i> Affection allures it; joy
and sorrow, hope and fear assail it;
but the Christian can withstand these
assaults, because he opposes higher
things to lower; Divine pleasures to
human, riches to riches, honours to
honours. He can realise the meaning
of the Master&rsquo;s words (Matt. xix.&nbsp;29).
Resting on such promises as these, he is
&ldquo;kept in perfect peace.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>G.&nbsp;R. Miall.</i></p>

<p class="gap" id="o214B">I. Peace is at once a blessing, and
a mother of blessings. How many
spring from her! How the poets have
sung of her! Peace is needed by
every man; every man is conscious
of disturbing influences without and
within. Peace is earnestly sought by
most men. What sanguinary wars
have been waged to obtain peace!</p>

<p>II. The idea of &ldquo;perfect peace,&rdquo;
presented in the text, seems to most
men at the most a beautiful dream;
in proportion to their experience of
life is their disbelief that it can be
theirs. But it is declared here that
God bestows it on every man whose
mind is stayed on Him.</p>

<p>What interpretation are we to put
upon this declaration? The experience
of God&rsquo;s people must be our guide in
answering this question. This makes
it abundantly clear that the peace
which God secures for His people does
not consist in freedom from assault.
This is sometimes vouchsafed them;
their foes are scattered, and songs of
triumph are given them, such as this
chapter. But their experience, taken as
a whole, may be said to be a continuous
verification of our Saviour&rsquo;s declaration:
&ldquo;In the world ye have tribulation.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Instead of caring to secure for His
people freedom from assault, He seems
rather often to prefer to expose them
to it (Matt. iii.&nbsp;16; iv.&nbsp;1). He prefers
rather to teach them to fight and to
conquer; to develop and discipline
their virtues by struggles in which
they are tried up to the very last point
of endurance. For this end, He turns
a deaf ear to their prayer, &ldquo;Lead us
not into temptation;&rdquo; and lets loose
upon the foes bent upon their destruction.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding, they may have
&ldquo;perfect peace.&rdquo; &ldquo;In the world ye
have tribulation: in Me ye have peace.&rdquo;
Not merely that the peace is to succeed
the tribulation; the two may co-exist.
It is quite possible for peace to dwell
in the heart of the chief ruler of a
nation waging a terrible <span class="wsnw">war;<a id="o214_fna2" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#o214_fn2">[2]</a></span>
or in the heart of the captain of a vessel
storm-driven; or in the heart of a
merchant in the midst of a commercial
panic, because he knows that the
struggle will for him end in victory.
So in the midst of all the conflicts of
life, a Christian may have &ldquo;perfect
peace.&rdquo;</p>

<p>III. A Christian; he, and no other!
Not every profound peace is &ldquo;perfect
peace.&rdquo; The contemporaries of Noah
and of Lot; Belshazzar and his court
were in &ldquo;perfect peace,&rdquo; as far as their
feelings were concerned, in the very
hour that destruction came upon them.
But however much the feelings may
be soothed, there is no &ldquo;perfect peace&rdquo;
that has not a sure basis of <i>fact.</i> For
the peace of the wicked there can be
no such basis; God and all the forces
of the universe are arrayed against
the wicked, and their ultimate destruction
is sure (Isa. xlviii.&nbsp;22; Rom. ii.&nbsp;8, 9).
Repentance and reconciliation
with God through Christ are the essential
preliminary conditions of &ldquo;perfect
peace.&rdquo;</p>

<p>IV. But is &ldquo;perfect peace&rdquo; the possession
of all who have complied with
these conditions? No. Why? Because
they have not yet learned to stay
their minds on God. They have faith,
but it is yet in the germ, and they
have not yet been trained in the exercise
<span class="pagenum" id="p267">[p.&nbsp;267]</span>
(Matt. xiv.&nbsp;31; xvi.&nbsp;8). Not upon
God exclusively are their hopes set
(Ps. xlii.&nbsp;5); it is but seldom that they
do look up to Him, and hence their
faith is imperfect and intermittent. It
remains in the power of their foes to
distress them; anxieties as to their
temporal necessities, and forebodings
as to their external welfare, harass and
weaken them. (For other reasons, see
preceding outlines.)</p>

<p>But there are those who have passed
through and beyond these elementary
stages of Christian experience, and,
steadily pursuing the paths of righteousness,
they have &ldquo;perfect peace.&rdquo;
Their circumstances may be adverse
and threatening, but they possess a
tranquillity of soul that is undisturbable
(2&nbsp;Cor. iv.&nbsp;8&ndash;10); nay, is even
triumphant (Rom. v.&nbsp;3; Acts xvi.&nbsp;25;
Hab. iii.&nbsp;17&ndash;19).</p>

<p>V. In this &ldquo;perfect peace&rdquo; these
rare souls rest, because they are kept
in it, by God Himself: &ldquo;<i>Thou</i> wilt
keep,&rdquo; &amp;c.</p>

<p>1. <i>How?</i> (1.)&nbsp;By the means of the deliverances
which from time to time
He works for them. Memory becomes
a treasury-house of Divine faithfulness
and mercy, and out of it their
souls are fed and sustained when a
season of famine and danger has befallen
them. Then they know that
He who has delivered will deliver,
and they wait upon Him with calm,
joyful expectation. (2.)&nbsp;To these souls
the records of God&rsquo;s deliverances of
His people in ancient days become
prophetic of deliverances He will still
work for His people right on to the
end of time. By His Spirit He works
in them an immovable, soul-inspiring
confidence in His own unchangeableness.
To them He is &ldquo;the living
God,&rdquo; acting to-day precisely as He
did in the days of old. (3.)&nbsp;But,
above all, He produces in their souls,
as the chief safeguard of their tranquillity,
a childlike confidence in His
personal love for them. There is nothing
they are so sure of as that God
loves them, and being sure of this, all
the rest follows as a matter of course.
They never forget what proof God
has given of His love for them, and
hence they reason precisely as St.
Paul did (Rom. viii.&nbsp;31&ndash;39). This
priceless revelation He makes to many
who are &ldquo;babes&rdquo; in this world&rsquo;s wisdom
(Matt. xi.&nbsp;25), and to others also
who know all that science has to teach
them of the vastness of the universe
and of their own relative insignificance.</p>

<p>2. <i>Why?</i> (1.)&nbsp;Because it is a state
of soul in which He delights. &ldquo;The
God of peace&rdquo; desires that in this, as
in all respects, His people&mdash;His <i>children</i>&mdash;should
be like Him. (2.)&nbsp;Because
they trust in Him. Devoting
themselves to His service, and putting
themselves into His care, His honour
is pledged to the defence and maintenance
of their welfare. Will he
forfeit it? <i>Men</i> are far gone in depravity
when they willingly disappoint
those who trust in them: guides
of the blind, lawyers and their clients,
doctors and their patients, widows
and their business <span class="wsnw">advisors.<a id="o214_fna3" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#o214_fn3">[3]</a></span>
What sacrifices we make to fulfil the expectations
we have encouraged our children
to form! Will it be otherwise
with our Father in heaven? Never!</p>

<p>VI. What then? 1.&nbsp;&ldquo;Trust ye in
the Lord for ever, for in the Lord Jehovah
is everlasting strength.&rdquo; There
is more than &ldquo;strength;&rdquo; but there
<i>is</i> the &ldquo;strength to carry out His
wise and loving purposes towards His
people.&rdquo; He can do more than pity.
2.&nbsp;Let us cultivate the habit of trusting
<span class="smcap">in the Lord,</span> and of doing this in
all the vicissitudes of our lot, &ldquo;for
ever.&rdquo; 3.&nbsp;And that this habit may
become to us invariable and its exercise
easy, let us accept with all simplicity
the revelation which He has been
pleased to make of Himself as our
Father in heaven. Precisely in proportion
as we do this we shall stay
our mind on Him, and we shall enter
into that &ldquo;perfect peace&rdquo; which He
desires should be the inheritance of
all His children.</p>

Can we turn aside and see what light
this peace of God can diffuse through the
chamber of disease; how it can tranquilise
the bosom of the poor widow surrounded with
<span class="pagenum" id="p268">[p.&nbsp;268]</span>
her helpless babes; what serenity it can shed
around the tottering steps of some aged saint;
and how it can irradiate the gloom even of the
grave itself, and not feel that it is rightly
called &ldquo;perfect?&rdquo; True, it might often be
more folly possessed on earth, and it will be
more fully possessed in heaven. But if we
remember what it has actually done in ten
thousand instances, when the dearest friends
have died, and property has taken wings and
flown away, and one pall of sadness has seemed
to overspread the entire world, we shall feel
that it is impossible to give it too high a
name or attach to it too high a value.&mdash;<i>Magie.</i></p></div>

Sir William Napier describes, in his
&ldquo;History of the Peninsular War,&rdquo; that at the
battle of Busaco in Portugal how affecting it
was to see a beautiful Portuguese orphan girl
coming down the mountain, driving an ass
loaded with all her property through the
midst of the armies. She passed over the
field of battle with a childish simplicity,
scarcely understanding which were French
and which were English, and no one on either
side was so hard-hearted as to touch her. Sir
William Napier once in his walks met with a
little girl of five years old, sobbing over a pitcher
she had broken. She, in her innocence,
asked him to mend it. He told her
that he could not mend it, but that he would
meet her trouble by giving her sixpence to
buy a new one, if she would meet him there
at the same hour the next evening, as he had
no money in his purse that day. When he
returned home he found that there was an invitation
waiting for him, which he particularly
wished to accept. But he could not then
have met the little girl at the time stated, and
he gave up the invitation, saying, &ldquo;I could
not disappoint her; she trusted in me so implicitly.&rdquo;
That was the true Christian English
gentleman and soldier.&mdash;<i>Dean Stanley.</i></p></div>

<h3 class="tdc" id="o215"><span class="smcap">The Righteousness of God and His People.</span></h3>

<p class="bq">xxvi.&nbsp;7. <i>The way of the just, &amp;c.</i></p>

<p>Isaiah foretold the captivity of Judah
to Babylon, also its termination.
This chapter is a song ready for the
occasion. It related the story, and it
unfolds the principles that underlie
the events.</p>

<p>Our text is thoroughly practical.
It reminds us&mdash;</p>

<p><b>I. That righteousness is the personal
characteristic of God and of His
redeemed people.</b> 1.&nbsp;<i>God is righteous.</i>
&ldquo;Thou most upright.&rdquo; He is perfectly
righteous. It is essential to
the Divine nature; the contrary cannot
be supposed; as heat is natural
to fire. God Himself, His laws, His
providential government, even His
redeeming mercy, all are characterised
by perfect rectitude. So prominent
is this idea that we are taught to
exercise simple faith in God, and
assume that we are imperfectly informed
if we are unable to reconcile
anything in our experience with His
perfect righteousness. 2.&nbsp;<i>His people
also are righteous</i>&mdash;here called &ldquo;the
just.&rdquo; It is suggestive when God&rsquo;s
people are thus called by a name similar
to His own. They share in the
same righteousness, although in different
degrees. More is intended than
that they are in a justified state.
That is implied. They are justified
by the grace of God through faith in
the Lord Jesus Christ. But the text
refers to the righteousness which assimilates
them to the Divine nature.
The grace of God produces a new
nature. Saul of Tarsus became a new
man on his conversion. A savage
adopts the habits and forms the tastes
of civilised Christian life. It is a
new nature. 1&nbsp;John iv.&nbsp;4: &ldquo;Ye are
of God.&rdquo; As children partake the nature
of their parents, His nature is
in them, though not yet perfected.
Their sympathies are with Him. In
so far as they are unrighteous, they
are inconsistent with their true selves.
The life of God in the regenerated soul
is a principle ever tending toward
the perfect righteousness of the
Divine nature from which it comes.</p>

<p><b>II. When righteousness characterises
a person, it will dictate his
conduct.</b> 1.&nbsp;<i>The conduct of the righteous
man.</i> &ldquo;The way of the just is uprightness;&rdquo;
his course of life. He is
erect in his moral manhood, as contrasted
with one who is bent and
<span class="pagenum" id="p269">[p.&nbsp;269]</span>
crooked. Men&rsquo;s ideas of uprightness
are apt to become partial and one-sided.
Some seem to imagine that
all demands of righteousness are
met by the acceptance of Christ and
the experience of spiritual feeling,
while they overlook the demands of
human relationships. Others confine
their view to men. They imagine all
demands are met, when they are fair
and honourable in their dealings with
men, while God is left out of consideration.
The Divine idea of righteousness
is not thus partial. It
takes in the whole of our moral
relations our relations both to God
and an. And the good man strives
to bring his whole life into conformity
to it. [Work this out in detail:
&ldquo;The way of the just is uprightness&rdquo;
(1),&nbsp;in regard to God; (2),&nbsp;in regard
to man.]</p>

<p>2. <i>The conduct of the righteous God.</i>
&ldquo;Thou most upright dost weigh the
path of the just.&rdquo; At first sight like
confusion of metaphor. It means to
ponder it. The heathen symbol of
Divine righteousness is that of justice
holding the scales (Dan. v.&nbsp;27). The conduct
of the righteous is weighed.
God observes it; His honour is concerned
in it. He will eventually
pronounce upon it (2&nbsp;Cor. v.&nbsp;10).</p>

<p>Examine, then:&mdash;1.&nbsp;Are you among
the just? Have you experienced a
change of heart? 2.&nbsp;Are you pursuing
the path of the just? This applies
to your actual dealing with God
and with man. Consider how far imperfection
may be consistent with
reality. Do not try how far you may
go safely. There comes a point at
which a man must be condemned, at
which he must condemn himself. At
that point he will either repent or
harden himself. Let us cultivate the
highest measure of practical uprightness.&mdash;<i>J. Rawlinson.</i></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 class="tdc" id="o216"><span class="smcap">The Just Man&rsquo;s Security.</span></h3>

<p class="bq">xxvi.&nbsp;7. <i>Thou most upright, dost weigh the path of the just.</i></p>

<p>We can scarcely find anywhere a
more touching description of the God
of our salvation than that furnished
by Job (Job xxxv.&nbsp;10). God has always
given His people songs in the night,
and in the night-time of affliction He
has furnished them with songs of consolation
and confidence. Our text is
a part of one of those songs. The
Chaldean power threatened God&rsquo;s
people. They were instructed to
cherish a firm faith in God. Not a
breath of despair was to reach the
camp of the enemy; rather they were
taught a scornful defiance of that
proud king who had defied the armies
of the living God (Isa. xxxvii.&nbsp;22).</p>

<p>&ldquo;In that day shall this song be
sung.&rdquo; The connection may teach us
that it is wisdom to treasure up a
source of consolation against the day
of adversity. It is in spring that we
are to prepare for winter; in the
morning of life to prepare for old
age. The oil must be ready for the
midnight hour. No good soldier will
run for his armour &ldquo;when the enemy
comes in like a flood.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The text suggests <i>the Christian&rsquo;s reasons
for security and repose under the
various events of life.</i> These are&mdash;</p>

<p><b>I. The perfect wisdom and rectitude
which marks God&rsquo;s universal government.</b>
&ldquo;Thou most upright, dost
weigh,&rdquo; &amp;c. This world is not a
neglected province of the Divine Dominions.
That impression of the
Divine supremacy which inspires the
songs of seraphs quickens the joy of
frail humanity. While thrones, principalities,
and powers exclaim as with
the voice of many waters, &ldquo;Alleluia,
for the Lord God Omnipotent reigneth,&rdquo;
the inhabitants of the earth roll
back the response, &ldquo;The Lord reigneth:
let the earth rejoice.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Christian knows no such Deity as
Chance or Fate. This is God&rsquo;s world,
nor has He left it like an ocean weed to
float at random on the dark and shoreless
ocean of uncertainty. What was
worthy His creation must be worth His
<span class="pagenum" id="p270">[p.&nbsp;270]</span>
control. God&rsquo;s method of government
partakes of His own perfections, and
is therefore infinitely wise and good.
We rejoice that God ruleth over <i>all,</i>
and keeps the dominion of the world
in His own hands. The remotest consequences
of things are all seen by
Him; whatever evil occurs He permits;
whatever good arises He originates;
whatever series of causes come
to a final issue, the train was laid by
His wisdom, conducted by His power,
controlled by His goodness. The
topic, therefore, furnishes a ground of
security and repose to the Christian.
Amidst the shakings of the nations
and the storms of life, it is delightful
to know that the sceptre of universal
power is in the hand of Infinite Love.
He reigneth, be the earth ever so unquiet.</p>

<p><b>II. The minute attention which God
pays to the individual interests of His
people.</b> This comes out whichever interpretation
you put upon the word
here translated &ldquo;weigh.&rdquo; It may
mean, to weigh as in scales or a
balance (Ps. lviii.&nbsp;2); but it may
also mean, and does usually, to make
straight, or smooth, or level (Ps. lxxviii.&nbsp;50, &ldquo;He leveled a path for his anger,&rdquo; [NAS],
&amp;c.) (<i>Barnes</i>). &ldquo;He &lsquo;weighs&rsquo; or
&lsquo;ponders&rsquo; (<i>s.&nbsp;w.&nbsp;a.</i> in Prov. iv.&nbsp;26, v.&nbsp;21)
the path, with a view to keeping
it straight and level&rdquo; (<i>Kay</i>). 1.&nbsp;The
idea of &ldquo;weighing&rdquo; implies careful
impression. The balance is held with
a careful hand, and a keen eye is on
both the scales. This is a source of
comfort to the just, and to them alone.
2.&nbsp;The same minute, condescending
observance is implied in the other interpretation.
God will make a plain,
level way for His people to walk in.
All obstacles to their progress shall
be removed. They never have any
need to turn aside from the well-constructed
road of God&rsquo;s commandments
into &ldquo;crooked ways&rdquo; of man&rsquo;s devising
(Ps. xvii.&nbsp;3&ndash;5). They shall reach
their destination in the better world.&mdash;<i>Samuel Thodey.</i></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 class="tdc" id="o217"><span class="smcap">The Way of God&rsquo;s Judgments.</span></h3>

<p class="bq">xxvi.&nbsp;8. <i>Yea, in the way of Thy judgments, O Lord, have we waited for Thee.</i></p>

<p><b>I. Observe what God&rsquo;s judgments are.</b>
They are simply the expression of
His thoughts. His final judgment is
the declaration of His thoughts of a
man&rsquo;s character; His judgments here
are also His declaration of what He
thinks of our conduct and ways. One
special thing for which psalmists and
prophets adore Him is that men can
see that His judgments are true and
righteous (Ps. xix.&nbsp;9; cxix.&nbsp;75, &amp;c.)
Their tendency and aim is to teach
men what righteousness is (ver. 9).</p>

<p><b>II. The way of God&rsquo;s judgments is
the way of His laws.</b> The calamities
which men call &ldquo;judgments&rdquo; are generally
the results of infraction by them
of the laws by which He governs the
universe.</p>

<p>The civil war in America was a
judgment of God because it was a
natural result of their toleration and
defence of slavery; the war, with all
its terrors, was a heavy penalty, and
was clearly connected with their sin.
So the cattle-plague of England was
doubtless a natural result of some violation,
through carelessness or greed,
of God&rsquo;s laws concerning the breeding
and tending of cattle, and was thus
one of God&rsquo;s judgments.</p>

<p><b>III. The way of God&rsquo;s judgments
prescribes our way of prayer and expectation.</b>
We are to pray and expect,
not that, while we continue as
we were, God will remove the judgment;
but that He will help us to understand
it, and that He will dispose
us to abandon the conduct that has
brought it upon us. In thus waiting
upon God&mdash;with penitence for our
transgression, with prayer for light,
and with sincere resolve to amend&mdash;we
may expect God to bless us; but
this we may expect only while we
wait upon Him thus.&mdash;<i>Alexander Mackennal,
B.S.: Sermon on the Cattle-plague.</i></p>

<p class="gap" id="o217A">Those who wait for God in the way
<span class="pagenum" id="p271">[p.&nbsp;271]</span>
of His judgments are, 1.&nbsp;Those who
in prosperous and peaceful times endeavour
to serve Him. 2.&nbsp;Those who
desire to learn from them the lessons
they were designed to teach. 3.&nbsp;Those
who honour God by submission and
trust in the trying hour. 4.&nbsp;These,
even in the midst of judgment, may
confidently expect the favour of God.
A purpose of benevolence runs through
even the stern and &ldquo;strange work&rdquo; of
justice; and God, even when He chastises,
will not utterly smite down the
trusting heart.&mdash;<i>William Manning.</i></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 class="tdc" id="o218"><span class="smcap">Trust and Trials.</span></h3>

<p class="bq">xxvi.&nbsp;8, 9. <i>Yea, in the way of Thy judgments&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. will I seek Thee early.</i></p>

<p>In this verse the prophet expresses
the confiding trust of God&rsquo;s people
amid times of judgment. It is as
though they had said, &ldquo;When the
pathway assigned for Thy people was
rough with judgments,&mdash;sore inflictions
of national calamity,&mdash;even
then, Lord, did we wait still on Thee
in patient, trustful hope, and our desire
was toward the remembrance of
Thy name.&rdquo; Note the view this passage
affords of the character and experience
of God&rsquo;s people.</p>

<p><b>I. They wait upon him.</b> Wait in
the most unpromising circumstances.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yea, in the way of Thy judgments
have we waited for Thee.&rdquo; When all
is dark and threatening; when the
promised mercy is long delayed and
all seems settling into gloom and desolation;
when the dungeon has no
lamp and the night no star, even then
does the Church wait for God (chap. viii.&nbsp;17).
It is a genuine mark of
grace to trust a withdrawing God
and never forego confidence in Him,
but look for Him as in the darkest
night the shivering sentinel looks for
the morning star; as the husbandman
amid the severest winter believes
in the returning spring. Such was
the faith of Habakkuk (Hab. iii.&nbsp;17&ndash;19).
So, like Aaron&rsquo;s rod, the Christian&rsquo;s
hope will bloom in the midst
of barrenness. &ldquo;Yea, in the way of
Thy judgments have I waited for
Thee.&rdquo;</p>

<p><b>II. Their desires centre in Him.</b>
&ldquo;The desire of our soul is to the
remembrance of Thy name.&rdquo; God&rsquo;s
<i>name</i> is a compendious expression
for the fulness of His perfections.
God&rsquo;s people are concerned for the
honour of God&rsquo;s name whatever becomes
of their own. Religion consists
much in holy desire. &ldquo;Thy servants
who desire to fear Thy name.&rdquo; They
desire to live in the fear of God, in His
love and in His service. Desire is love
on the wing; delight is love at rest.
David combines both (Ps. xxxvii.&nbsp;4).
Making God our heart&rsquo;s delight, He
will not fail to give us our heart&rsquo;s
desire. This desire, if genuine, will
never be satisfied without God. As
well offer lumps of gold or strains of
music to one dying of thirst, as offer
the world&rsquo;s best gifts to that soul
which truly thirsts for God and His
righteousness (Ps. lxxiii.&nbsp;25). 1.&nbsp;<i>Where
genuine, this desire is the fruit of implanted
grace.</i> It is an evidence of a
renewed nature. The beating of the
pulse proves life. That which aspires
to God has come from heaven.
If the iron, contrary to its nature,
moves upward, it is a sign that some
magnetic force attracts it; and if the
soul aspires to God, that is a sign that
the grace of God has visited that soul.
2.&nbsp;<i>Genuine desires after God are influential.</i>
Real desires govern our conduct
(Prov. xxi.&nbsp;25). It is useless to pretend
that we thirst for grace, if by
devout prayer and holy resolve we do
not let down the bucket into the well.</p>

<p><b>III. They seek Him diligently night
and day.</b> &ldquo;With my soul have I desired
Thee in the night, yea, with my
spirit within me will I seek Thee early.&rdquo;
Our Lord gives it as the distinctive
mark of God&rsquo;s elect that they cry
night and day to Him. This habit
of prayer prompting to duty, tests
the sincerity of our desires, &amp;c.&mdash;<i>Samuel Thodey.</i></p>

<h3 class="tdc" id="o219"><span class="smcap">Night Longings for God.</span></h3>

<p class="bq">xxvi.&nbsp;9. <i>With my soul I desired thee in the night.</i></p>

<p>Night appears to be a time peculiarly
favourable to devotion. Its
solemn stillness helps to free the
mind from that perpetual din which
the cares of the world will bring
around it; and the stars looking
down from heaven upon us shine as
if they would attract us up to God.
But I leave that thought altogether;
I shall speak,&mdash;</p>

<p>I. <span class="smcap">To Confirmed Christians.</span>
1.&nbsp;The Christian man has not always
a bright shining sun; he has seasons
of darkness and night. The light
is sometimes eclipsed. At certain
periods clouds and darkness cover the
sun. The best of God&rsquo;s saints have
their nights. Sometimes it is a night
over the whole Church at once. Sometimes
the darkness over the soul arises
from temporal distresses, sometimes
from spiritual discouragements.
2.&nbsp;A Christian man&rsquo;s religion will keep
its colour in the night. Men will
follow Christ when every one cries
Hosanna! Demas and Mr. Hold-the-world,
and a great many others,
are very pious people in easy times.
They will always go with Christ by
daylight, and will keep Him company
so long as fashion gives religion the
doubtful benefit of its patronage;
but they will not go with Him in the
night. But the best test of a Christian
is the night. If he only remained
steadfast by daylight, when every
coward is bold, where would he be?
There would be no beauty in his
courage, no glory in his bravery.
There is full many a Christian whose
piety did not burn much when he was
in prosperity; but it will be known
in adversity. Grind the diamond a
little, and you shall see it glisten.
3.&nbsp;All that the Christian wants in the
night is his God. I cannot understand
how it is, unless it is to be accounted
for by the corruption of our
spirit, that when everything goes well
with us we are setting our affection
first on one object and then on another,
and that desire which is as insatiable
as death and as deep as hell
never rests satisfied. But if you place
a Christian in trouble, you will find
that he does not want gold then, nor
carnal honour; he wants his God.
4.&nbsp;There are times when all the saint
can do is to desire. The more evidences
a man has of his piety the
better. Many witnesses will carry
our case better at the bar than a few.
But there are seasons when a Christian
cannot get any. He will have
lost assurance. But there is one witness
that very seldom is gagged, even
in the night, and that is, &ldquo;I have desired
Thee&mdash;I have desired Thee in
the night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>II. <span class="smcap">To Newly Awakened Souls.</span>
I will now endeavour to answer three
questions. 1.&nbsp;How am I to know
that my desires are proofs of a work
of grace in my soul? (1.)&nbsp;By their
<i>constancy.</i> Many a man when he hears
a stirring sermon has a strong desire
to be saved, but he goes home and
forgets it. A certain measure of constancy
is essential to its real value as
evidence of a Divine work. (2.)&nbsp;By
their <i>efficacy.</i> If they lead you into
real &ldquo;works meet for repentance,&rdquo;
then they come from God. Seeking
will not do; there must be striving.
Not good intentions only, but practical
desires that lead you to give up
your sins. (3.)&nbsp;By their <i>urgency.</i> You
want to be saved some of you, but it
must be this day next week. But
when the Holy Ghost speak, He says
<i>&ldquo;To-day.&rdquo;</i> Now or never.
2.&nbsp;If I have desired God, why have
I not obtained my desires before now?
(1.)&nbsp;You have hardly a right to ask
the question. Perhaps God has not
granted your desire because He designs
to show you more of your
wickedness, more of the blackness of
sin, that your longings may be quickened,
that He may display more
fully the riches of His grace at the
last. (2.)&nbsp;Perhaps it has come already.
<span class="pagenum" id="p273">[p.&nbsp;273]</span>
Some of you are pardoned and
do not know it. Do not expect miracles
and visions. (3.)&nbsp;Will God grant
my desire at last? Verily. His refusal
would dishonour His word. You would
be the first that ever perished desiring,
praying, trusting in Jesus.&mdash;<i>C.&nbsp;H. Spurgeon,
New Park Street Pulpit,</i> 1859, p. 237.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 class="tdc" id="o220"><span class="smcap">The Necessity and Profitableness of Chastisement.</span></h3>

<p class="bq">xxvi.&nbsp;9. <i>When Thy judgments are in the earth, the inhabitants of the earth will
learn righteousness.</i></p>

<p>I. <i>It is a lamentable proof of the depravity
of our nature, that in general,
apart from God&rsquo;s judgments, the wicked
will not learn righteousness.</i> 1.&nbsp;The
history of the world shows that men
will not give heed to the lessons they
<i>ought</i> to learn from the beauty of
creation, the established laws of nature,
and the ordinary blessings of Providence
(Rom. i.&nbsp;20&ndash;23). Extraordinary
blessings excite only transient emotions
of praise and thanksgiving; and too
often serve only as occasions for showing
greater alienation of heart from
God, and for filling up the measure of
iniquity (H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I., 3997&ndash;4014). 2.&nbsp;All
this may be abundantly illustrated
from the history of our own country.
With us times of national prosperity
have been times of national profanity.
3.&nbsp;On every hand we find individual
proofs of the same sad fact.</p>

<p>II. <i>When such special interferences of
Providence take place as in Scripture
language are called &ldquo;judgments,&rdquo; the
inhabitants of the earth sometimes learn
righteousness.</i> In this respect, signal
chastisements are ordinarily more effective
than the most bountiful displays of
kindness and compassion. 1.&nbsp;Scripture
abounds with statements of the
need and profitableness of chastisement
(Ps. cxix.&nbsp;67, 71; 2&nbsp;Chron. xxxiii.&nbsp;12,
&amp;c.) It is intimated that afflictions
form an essential part of the discipline
of the righteous (Ps. xxxiv.&nbsp;19; Rev.
iii.&nbsp;19, &amp;c.) Some cross is needful, as
long as we live, to keep us in our right
place, dependent on our Maker; and
hence those who have few outward
afflictions to teach them the necessary
lessons of humility, generally experience
a large allotment of inward
trials on that very account; and sometimes
both the outward and the inward
afflictions are combined for this purpose
(2&nbsp;Cor. xii.&nbsp;7, 10). 2.&nbsp;Even without
the Bible, the fact asserted in our
text was so universal and prominent,
that it by no means escaped the wiser
part of the heathen moralists. A Greek
historian has observed, &ldquo;that fortune
never bestows liberally an unmixed
happiness on mankind. With all her
gifts, there is conjoined some disastrous
circumstance, in order to chastise men
into a reverence for the gods, whom,
in a continual course of prosperity,
they are apt to neglect and forget.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Conclusion.</span>&mdash;1.&nbsp;<i>Few things are more
perilous than long-continued prosperity.</i>&mdash;Ordinarily
its effects on the religious
opinions and moral habits of nations
and individuals are most lamentable
(Deut. xxxi.&nbsp;20, 29). Let those, then,
who are prosperous be especially on
their guard (Deut. viii.&nbsp;10, 11).
2.&nbsp;<i>For &ldquo;judgments&rdquo; we should be thankful.</i>
They are not displays of vindictiveness,
but gracious and compassionate dispensations,
intended to warn, that God
may not be compelled to destroy.
3.&nbsp;<i>To the lessons of God&rsquo;s &ldquo;judgments&rdquo;
we should give heed.</i> Prominent among
them is this, that &ldquo;except the Lord
keep the city, the watchman waketh
but in vain.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Isaac Milner, D.D.:
Sermons,</i> vol. i. pp. 1&ndash;54.</p>

<p class="gap" id="o220A">I. <span class="smcap">Consider the Author of those
judgments and calamities with
which they are visited; the ends
for which they are sent; and
their fitness to instruct us in
righteousness.</span>&mdash;1.&nbsp;Judgments <i>come
from God.</i> His providence rules over
all, and all second causes, animate and
inanimate, are directed and overruled
by Him. This is the decision of
<i>reason,</i> and the declaration of <i>revelation</i>
<span class="pagenum" id="p274">[p.&nbsp;274]</span>
(Amos iii.&nbsp;6; Isa. xlv.&nbsp;6, 7). Imitate,
then, the ancient believers who, whatever
were the inferior causes of their
affliction, without justifying the instruments,
and leaving to God the punishment
of the unrighteous, ever looked
up to Him who ruleth over all (Gen.
xlv.&nbsp;5, 7; Job i.&nbsp;21; H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I., 139).
2.&nbsp;<i>But why does God visit us with judgments?</i>
Not that He delights in the
miseries of His creatures (Lam. iii.&nbsp;33);
but that they may be humbled, convinced
of their iniquity, and taught
righteousness. We often compel Him
thus to deal with us. We permit His
favours to hide the hand that confers
them; and, like Jonah, when the ocean
of life is smooth, and the gales of prosperity
pleasantly blow, we flee from
Him, and slumber in our sin. In the
greatness of His compassion, He employs
the rough means necessary to
arouse us (Ps. lxxviii.&nbsp;34, 35).
3.&nbsp;<i>There is a fitness in judgments to cause
men to awake to righteousness.</i> (1.)&nbsp;They
deeply affect us, and lead us to repentance,
because they are rarer than
mercies. Our attention is most arrested
by that which is novel. We gaze more
earnestly on the sun, when for a few
moments it is in eclipse, than we have
done for months while it was steadily
pursuing its course through the heavens.
We are more roused by a storm for a
day, than by serene weeks. It is thus
with mercies and judgments.
(2.)&nbsp;They powerfully address that passion
which has most influence on the greater
part of mankind&mdash;the passion of fear.
They present God in such a character,
that even the most stout-hearted sinners
tremble to oppose Him.
(3.)&nbsp;Because they teach on that most compendious
and efficacious mode&mdash;by example.
On beholding them we feel
that the threatenings of God are not
a dead letter which need fill us with
no dismay. Yet they have not invariably
this effect. There are some who
can resist judgments as well as mercies
(2&nbsp;Chron. xxviii.&nbsp;22; Isa. xxii.&nbsp;12, 13).</p>

<p>II. <span class="smcap">Why the judgments of God do
not always teach men righteousness.</span>
Judgments that light upon others
are frequently rendered useless. 1.&nbsp;By
disbelief of His declarations. 2.&nbsp;By
false views of His character (H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I.,
2180&ndash;2184, 2282). 3.&nbsp;By unscriptural
views of our own state and condition.
4.&nbsp;By a base inattention to
the operations of Providence. 5.&nbsp;By
a stupid insensibility to our danger.
We tranquilly behold the lightning
flashing at a distance, and suppose
that it will not hurt us, as though
we were of a different nature from
those who are consumed by it (Zeph.
iii.&nbsp;6, 7). 6.&nbsp;Because, instead of being
humbled and led to think of our sins,
we vent our grief only in vain regrets
and useless lamentations. We forget
who is the Author of these judgments,
and so, instead of humbly saying with
Job, &ldquo;Shew me, wherefore Thou contendest
with me,&rdquo; we waste our strength
in profitless complaints of men and
things.&mdash;<i>Henry Kollock, D.D., Sermons,</i>
pp. 505&ndash;512.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 class="tdc" id="o221"><span class="smcap">The Use and Abuse of the Judgments of God.</span></h3>

<p class="bq">xxvi.&nbsp;9, 10. <i>For when Thy judgments, &amp;c.</i></p>

<p>I. <i>The judgments of God are frequently
in the earth</i>&mdash;such as earthquakes, hurricanes,
pestilence, commercial disasters.
These are not, as the infidel
asserts, merely the results of the working
of natural causes: these public
calamities are the punishment of public
sins. <i>Nations</i> are thus punished,
because they have no immortality,
and therefore, if they are to be judged
at all, must be judged here and now.
Without these chastisements, which
often astonish the hearts of the most
insensible, and bring the most incredulous
to their right mind, the
world would be only a theatre of
atheism and crime. That these calamites
are strictly &ldquo;the judgments of
God,&rdquo; is the testimony of <i>Scripture</i>
(Amos iii.&nbsp;6; Jer. xxxii.&nbsp;23, &amp;c.), of
the universal <i>conscience,</i> which appeals
loudly in terms of <span class="wsnw">calamity,<a id="o221_fna1" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#o221_fn1">[1]</a></span> and of
<span class="pagenum" id="p275">[p.&nbsp;275]</span>
<i>reason.</i> Acknowledge a First Cause
which directs all things, and we are
obliged to confess that public calamities
are the judgments of God.</p>

<p>II. <i>God&rsquo;s design in sending His judgments
upon the earth is that the inhabitants
thereof should learn righteousness</i>&mdash;righteousness
towards Him, towards
their neighbours, and towards themselves.
This is His design, and to
comply with it is the indispensable
duty of those who He <span class="wsnw">afflicts.<a id="o221_fna2" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#o221_fn2">[2]</a></span>
The natural tendency of these chastisements
is to remove the obstacles
that ordinarily oppose themselves to
our conversion: indolence, thoughtlessness,
abuse of God&rsquo;s patience, the
hope of long <span class="wsnw">life.<a id="o221_fna3" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#o221_fn3">[3]</a></span></p>

<p>III. <i>God&rsquo;s design in sending judgments
upon the earth is often frustrated by the
fact that some sinners are so obdurate that
neither judgments nor mercies will move
them</i> (v. 10). The &ldquo;favour&rdquo; here
spoken of is a temporal favour, a
deliverance from physical misery, a
suspension of the judgments which
were falling upon the wicked. Such
favours, instead of calling forth gratitude,
are frequently turned into
reasons for sinning (Eccl. viii.&nbsp;11;
Ex. viii.&nbsp;15). To harden ourselves
against the &ldquo;judgments&rdquo; of God is a
great sin, but to harden ourselves
against His &ldquo;favours&rdquo; is a still greater
sin. Those who commit it leave the
Almighty no alternative but to utterly
destroy them.&mdash;<i>Daniel de Superville:
Sermons,</i> pp. 332&ndash;361.</p>

We see that people of every description
endeavour to appease Heaven, in time of public
calamities, by prayers, incense, sacrifices, and
solemn humiliations. And though many of
them have been deceived in the object of their
worship, and have erred in many of the practises
which they adopted as proper to appease
the Divinity, their actions set forth the feelings
of man&rsquo;s conscience, and prove that it is
a general sentiment, that in public calamities
we ought to learn righteousness.&mdash;<i>Superville.</i></p></div>

<div class="footnote" id="o221_fn2"><p><a href="#o221_fna2"><span class="label">[2]</span></a>
Judgment that falls upon another should
be as a catechism to us by way of instruction;
when judgments are abroad in the world, shall
not the people learn righteousness? Shall the
lion roar and the beasts of the field not tremble?
Shall God&rsquo;s hand lie heavily upon us, and we
stand by, as idle spectators, nothing at all
minding what is done? Shall our very next
neighbour&rsquo;s house be on fire, and we look on
as men unconcerned in the danger? It cannot
be, it must not be. There is, without all
doubt, the same combustible stuff&mdash;the same,
if not greater sins&mdash;lodged in our hearts, and
the same punishment hovering over our heads;
it is, therefore, high time to look about us.&mdash;<i>Donne,</i> 1573&ndash;1631.</p></div>

Herodotus informs us, that in a certain
temple of Egypt there was a statue of Sennacherib
with an inscription, the sense of which
was, &ldquo;Learn to fear the Deity, in looking at
me.&rdquo; The judgments of God upon rebellious
sinners are monuments which God erects in
the world, and which express, in characters
which all men should read, &ldquo;Learn to fear
the Deity, in looking at us.&rdquo; A celebrated
poet among the ancient Romans, in describing
the divers punishments of hell, presents
us with a fine sentence, &ldquo;Learn righteousness
by us, and do not despise the gods.&rdquo; It appears
by this, that the secrets of man&rsquo;s conscience,
and his natural sentiments, lead him
to profit by the examples which God exhibits
of His justice, whether in this world or the
next, and to respect a Supreme Being who
knows how to avenge Himself, both now and
hereafter.&mdash;<i>Superville.</i></p></div>

<h3 class="tdc" id="o222"><span class="smcap">National Peace the Gift of God.</span></h3>

<p class="tdc">(<i>A Thanksgiving Sermon.</i>)</p>

<p class="bq">xxvi.&nbsp;12. <i>Lord, Thou wilt ordain peace for us: for Thou hast wrought all our
work in us.</i></p>

<p>The joyfulness of the occasion.
Peace a greater blessing than mere
victory; for he that celebrates victory
celebrates an event which has been
produced by an incalculable measure
of human suffering. Let us consider&mdash;</p>

<p><b>I. What there is in the restoration
of peace, generally considered, to excite
our gratitude.</b> 1.&nbsp;<i>The effusion of
human blood is stayed,</i> and all the suffering
inescapable from war. 2.&nbsp;<i>The injurious
effects of war on human character</i> afford
another reason for thanksgiving on the
return of peace. War renders men callous
to human misery. The sacredness
of human life is forgotten. Wars
lead to intestine dissensions, and
embitter and perpetuate national animosities.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="p276">[p.&nbsp;276]</span>
<b>II. What there is in the particular
circumstances of this country to warrant
us in considering the blessing as
of special and particular value.</b> 1.&nbsp;<i>The
triumph of which this peace is the result is
the triumph of a righteous cause.</i> Peace
is often the result of the superiority
acquired by the aggressor. The cause
of right does not always at once prevail.
Unoffending natives are conquered,
or obliged to submissions contrary
to their rights and interests, and
then peace follows; peace dictated,
not argued. There is peace, but not
the spirit of peace. 2.&nbsp;<i>We have preserved
our national honour.</i> Our victory
has not been purchased by any alliance
of which we have cause to be ashamed.
3.&nbsp;<i>Peace does not find us, as it finds
many nations, with our houses desolated
and our cities destroyed by fire.</i> 4.&nbsp;<i>It
was seasonable.</i> We had put forth our
utmost strength. Had we not succeeded
at the moment we should have
fallen to rise no more as a nation of
the first order. 5.&nbsp;<i>It may be considered
an indication of the Divine approbation.</i>
On this subject we would not be presumptuous,
but it may at least be
affirmed that the happy change in our
affairs, which has ultimately led to
peace, followed, and, in some instances,
immediately followed, certain acts of
national reformation (<i>e.g.,</i> the emancipation
of the slaves) and acknowledgement
of God which, from the condescending
assurance of His Word, we
know must have been acceptable to
Him. 6.&nbsp;<i>It will increase our means of
promoting the kingdom of Christ in the
world, and thus establish our national
prosperity by continuing to us the blessing
of God.</i></p>

<p><b>III. The reasons of our thankful
acknowledgement of God on this occasion.</b>
He is the giver of the blessing
of peace. Text. This is a most important
principle, and if our hearts be
not firmly grounded in it, our thanksgiving
is a mockery; for why do we
thank Him if we ascribe the work to
second causes? He that excludes God
from the world of providence might as
well exclude Him from the world of
nature. He who can attribute the
events which are daily taking place in
society, and especially such events as
are connected with the celebration of
this day, to mere human agency, is
not less an atheist than the man who
ascribes the birth and being of the fair
system of the universe to chance or
the dance of atoms.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Conclusion.</span>&mdash;The proper expression
of our thankfulness for this great
blessing will be to do our utmost in
the diffusion of the Gospel, that the
final reign of the Prince of Peace may
commence, and &ldquo;quietness and assurance
for ever&rdquo; becomes the lot of man.&mdash;<i>Richard Watson:
Works,</i> vol. ii. pp. 20&ndash;40.</p>

our works in us.</i></p>

<p>Rather, <i>&ldquo;for us.&rdquo;</i> The Church acknowledges
that all her deliverances
and successes have been accomplished
for her; and on what God has done
for her in the past, she rightly bases
her expectation as to what God will
do for her in the future. He who was
able to deliver His people from their
bondage in Babylon, would secure
peace for them when He had restored
them to their own land. But, then,
of all the works that God accomplishes

are precisely those which He
accomplishes <i>in</i> them. So we may
profitably meditate on our text as it
stands:</p>

<p>I. <span class="smcap">The Christian&rsquo;s condition.</span></p>

<p>1. <i>A Divine work has been accomplished
for him. &ldquo;Thou,&rdquo;</i> &amp;c. Throughout,
the New Testament teaches us that
the Christian is a man, not who has
delivered himself, but who has been
delivered; not a hero who broke the
chains by which he was bound, but a
poor slave of sin who was set free and
<span class="pagenum" id="p277">[p.&nbsp;277]</span>
uplifted to true manhood (Phil. ii.&nbsp;13;
Eph. ii.&nbsp;10); everything is ascribed
to the Spirit&mdash;the life, the good works,
the comforts of the Christian (John
iii.&nbsp;5; Gal. v.&nbsp;16, 22; Acts ix.&nbsp;31).
2.&nbsp;<i>As the operation is Divine, so is it
internal in its effects.</i> We should never
overlook what God has done for us in
His kind and tender providence (Ps.
xxiii.&nbsp;6). But the greatest of all God&rsquo;s
works for us is redemption by the
blood of the cross. This was accomplished
long ago (John xix.&nbsp;30). Nothing
can now be added to it, but you
are mistaken if you suppose that His
work <i>for</i> you is to supersede His work
<i>in</i> you. If your sins are not subdued
as well as pardoned, you will never be
able to serve and enjoy God. Unless
you have a meetness for heaven, as
well as a title for it, you will never be
at home there. The salvation that is
promised and accomplished is internal
(John iv.&nbsp;14; Ezek. xi.&nbsp;19, 20; Ps. li.&nbsp;10).
3.&nbsp;<i>The operation is manifold in its
influence.</i> &ldquo;<i>All</i> our works.&rdquo; How
much needs to be done in man! Conscience
is to be awakened, purified,
pacified; the understanding is to be
enlightened; the judgment is to be
informed; the will is to be subdued;
the affections to be spiritualised; the
world is to be dethroned in the heart,
and holy principles implanted there.
There needs the continuing act of a
performing God from the hour of the
first conviction of sin to the resurrection
of the body unto eternal life (Phil.
i.&nbsp;6). 4.&nbsp;<i>His Divine work is acknowledged.</i>
&ldquo;Thou <i>hast</i> wrought,&rdquo; &amp;c. Much remains
to be done in us, but much has
been accomplished in every believer,
and it should be acknowledged. Humility
well becomes us, but gratitude
becomes us equally (Ps. lxvi.&nbsp;16).</p>

<p>II. <span class="smcap">His future expectation.</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Lord, Thou wilt ordain peace for
us.&rdquo; 1.&nbsp;There is an <i>appointment</i> or
<i>ordination.</i> To ordain is an act of
authority and power. You may wish
and promise a thing, but the monarch
ordains, and what he ordains is supported
by all the resources of the
realm, and will be accomplished. Much
more shall God&rsquo;s counsel stand and His
pleasure be done. 2.&nbsp;What is the
<i>blessing</i> He will ordain? &ldquo;Peace!&rdquo;
Peace <i>temporal</i> (Prov. xvi.&nbsp;7). Peace

<p>III. <span class="smcap">The dependence of the expectation
on the condition.</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Thou wilt&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. for Thou hast.&rdquo;
The expectations of God&rsquo;s people are
based&mdash;1.&nbsp;On the experience of God&rsquo;s
people in all generations (Ps. xxii.&nbsp;4).
2.&nbsp;On their own experience of His
faithfulness and mercy (Ps. cxvi.&nbsp;1,

See outlines on verse 3.&mdash;This peace
of the Christian often fluctuates. It has various
degrees. Some have comparatively little of
it, arising from constitutional malady, but it
commonly increases in death. It is therefore
compared to a river which meanders and
fertilises as it goes, but becomes wider and
deeper as it approximates to the sea; so the
peace of God&rsquo;s people generally increases as
they get nearer eternity.&mdash;<i>Jay.</i></p></div>

When a friend has always been kind,
we think it base and unworthy not to suppose
that he is ready to succour and help.
But here we have the advantage: Men may
be weak and unable to help, but God is almighty;
men may change their mind, but
with Him is &ldquo;no shadow of turning.&rdquo; Remember
what God has done, view it as a
pledge, a beginning, an earnest foretaste of
what He will do. Has He not shown you the
evil of sin, the beauty of holiness, and the
preciousness of a Saviour? If He had a mind
to destroy you, would He have shown you
such things as these? Nay, He will ordain
everything for your welfare.&mdash;<i>Jay.</i></p>

<h3 class="tdc" id="o224"><span class="smcap">Man&rsquo;s Holiness, God&rsquo;s Workmanship.</span></h3>

<p class="bq">xxvi.&nbsp;12. <i>Thou also hast wrought all our works in us.</i></p>

<p>It is not all men who could speak
these words to God; the wicked and
the worldly-minded could not use such
language without blasphemy. It is
the godly, and they only, who can
dare to use the language of our text,
<span class="pagenum" id="p278">[p.&nbsp;278]</span>
and even they must do so with a certain
limitation. Nothing that is evil
in any of God&rsquo;s people is in any way
His work. It is only their <i>good</i> works
of which it can be truly said, &ldquo;God
wrought them;&rdquo; and of these it may
be said, God wrought not some only,
but <i>all</i> of them.</p>

<p>I. <span class="smcap">The doctrine which our text
contains.</span> Man is by nature a creature
so depraved that he is &ldquo;unto
every good work reprobate.&rdquo; God
looks into his heart, and seeing evil
motives even in his best performances
pronounces &ldquo;all his righteousnesses
&lsquo;filthy <span class="wsnw">rags.&rsquo;&thinsp;&rdquo;</span> Where things are not
done to please God, He is <i>displeased.</i>
No matter what show the unregenerate
make before their fellow-sinners, God
turns away His face from them, and
counts them even &ldquo;dead in trespasses
and sins,&rdquo; whilst <i>men,</i> perhaps, are
holding them in admiration (Article
xiii.; Luke xvi.&nbsp;15; Rom. viii.&nbsp;7, 8).
When, therefore, a man <i>does</i> begin
to please God, it is because God
hath &ldquo;wrought him for this self-same
thing&rdquo; by the mighty working of His
power (Eph. ii.&nbsp;4, 5; Phil. ii.&nbsp;13). In
these passages the earliest beginning
of any good work in us is ascribed
wholly to the Lord (Article x.) The
Holy Spirit is the author of all good
in man from first to last. &ldquo;From
Him all holy desires, all good counsels,
and all just works do proceed.&rdquo; <i>Repentance
is His Work.</i> &ldquo;Godly sorrow&rdquo;
is no natural emotion (Acts v.&nbsp;31;
xi.&nbsp;18; 2&nbsp;Tim. ii.&nbsp;25). So also
is <i>faith</i> (1&nbsp;Cor. xii.&nbsp;3). So, again, is
all <i>holiness</i> of heart and life (Eph. ii.&nbsp;10;
Prov. xvi.&nbsp;1; Gal. v.&nbsp;22, 23).
All excellences in man are &ldquo;fruits of
the <i>Spirit.</i>&rdquo; Such is the doctrine of
our text. Consider,&mdash;</p>

<p>II. <span class="smcap">The feelings which God&rsquo;s
people ought to entertain when
they reflect upon it.</span> Is it true
that God hath wrought all our works
in us? What a ground there is
here, then,&mdash;1.&nbsp;For <b>humility.</b> Surely
&ldquo;boasting is excluded.&rdquo; Pride is an
absurdity (1&nbsp;Cor. iv.&nbsp;7; xv.&nbsp;10.)
2.&nbsp;For <b>thankfulness.</b> Solomon was full
of wonder and amazement that God
should condescend to come and dwell
within his costly temple. Should not
the Lord&rsquo;s people be still more gratefully
amazed that He should make a
temple of their hearts? 3.&nbsp;For <b>encouragement</b>
(Phil. i.&nbsp;6). Let the
believer look at the very construction
of our text, let him read it in connection
with the words which go before,
and he will see what a comfortable
argument is drawn from it: &ldquo;Lord,
Thou <i>wilt</i> ordain peace for us, <i>for</i>
Thou also hast wrought all our works
in us.&rdquo; The presence of His grace
within our bosoms is a token of the
favour which He means to show us.
He who put oil into our lamp and
set it burning, and then said, &ldquo;Let your
light shine before men, that they may
see your good works, and glorify your
Father which is in heaven,&rdquo; will never
omit to feed the celestial flame.&mdash;<i>A.

<h3 class="tdc" id="o225"><span class="smcap">Spiritual Usurpers Renounced.</span></h3>

<p class="bq">xxvi.&nbsp;13, 14. <i>O Lord our God, other lords beside Thee have had dominion over us, &amp;c.</i></p>

<p>We have in this language&mdash;</p>

<p>I. <span class="smcap">A penitential confession.</span> &ldquo;Other
lords,&rdquo; &amp;c. Exegetically the point to
be determined is whether the &ldquo;other
lords&rdquo; who &ldquo;have ruled over us,&rdquo; are
the king and people of Babylon or idol
gods; the former with coercion, the
latter with their own wicked consent?
Perhaps both ideas are included and
a sad sequence implied. They had
wandered of their own wicked will
into the service of pagan gods, and
now against their will were forced to
serve pagan kings. Paganism had led
to vice; vice had destroyed all true
manliness. Heroism in Jewish history
had lived only so long as fidelity to
Jehovah had lasted. Piety having
decayed, heroism was dead; they
could not stand before their invaders.
<span class="pagenum" id="p279">[p.&nbsp;279]</span>
Paganism had enslaved them. This they
now feel, and hate paganism, and shun
it more thoroughly than ever before.</p>

<p>II. <span class="smcap">A holy resolve,</span> involving,
1.&nbsp;<i>A recognition of Divine claims.</i> It is right
that we should consecrate our services
to Thee. By Thee created and sustained,
it is robbery to carry our services
elsewhere. Thou art our Father,
and to honour others instead of Thee
is unfilial ingratitude. Our King Thou
art, and not to serve Thee is sedition.
2.&nbsp;<i>A consciousness of dependence on
Divine help.</i> &ldquo;But by Thee only,&rdquo; &amp;c.,
<i>i.e.,</i> &ldquo;Only by Thy Divine help can we
hope to be faithful to Thee.&rdquo; Here is
a renunciation, not only of heathenism,
but also of all self-sufficiency. By sad
experience they have learnt that without
God they can do nothing.</p>

<p>III. <span class="smcap">A shout of victory</span> (vers. 14).
The struggle against sin may be severe
and long. Bad habits not easily
overcome. But Divine help gives victory
to human endeavours. He who
uttered the almost despairing cry,
&ldquo;O wretched man that I am,&rdquo; &amp;c., can
now give the victorious shout, &rdquo;I
thank God through our Lord Jesus
Christ.&rdquo; There are those who once
served mammon, and bowed to ambition;
who followed the Moloch of revenge
and hate; slaves to drunkenness
and nameless vices, who now through
Divine grace can say of these bad habits,
&ldquo;They are dead&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Thou hast visited
and destroyed them,&rdquo; &amp;c.&mdash;<i>W. Parkes.</i></p>

<p class="gap" id="o225A">Man is a responsible being. To say
he is responsible to himself is to say
nothing more than that he claims to
act according to his own inclination.
Responsibility has regard to another.
Lordship from without is exercised
by every human soul. Good and
evil&mdash;God and Satan&mdash;contend for the
dominion. Evil usurps the dominion
until an inward revolution occurs.
Thus the Jewish people had cast off
the authority of Jehovah, and placed
themselves under the dominion of
other gods. The captivity in Babylon
converted them from this folly.
They then determined that thenceforward
they would only &ldquo;make mention
of,&rdquo; celebrate and honour, give
the dominion to the Lord their God.
Here is a penitential confession and a
good resolution.</p>

<p>I. <span class="smcap">A penitential confession.</span>
&ldquo;Other lords beside Thee have had
dominion over us.&rdquo; The dominion
of evil in human souls is: 1.&nbsp;<i>Multiform.</i>
It assumes many shapes. The gods
the Jewish people served were numerous
as the nations under whose influence
they fell. So the form of evil
most congenial to a man&rsquo;s own nature
is sure to assail him (H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I., 4679&ndash;4683).
Not only so; while each has
probably his special besetment, each
has also multitudinous besetments
(H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I., 4550, 4551). The penitent
sees that his sins pass all power of
numeration or recollection; they have
become lords and masters (Rom. vi.&nbsp;16;
H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I., 4482&ndash;4484). 2.&nbsp;<i>Wrongful.</i>
&ldquo;Other lords beside Thee.&rdquo; The
language implies that God ought to
have had the dominion. Then it must
be wrong to give it to others. He is
the rightful sovereign on every ground.
Nor can he divide His throne with
any rival. As it is impossible to serve
two masters whose interests are opposed
to each other, or to adhere to
two claimants of the same crown, so
is it to make mention of the name of
God and at the same time to submit
to the dominion of other lords. But
we have attempted this. &ldquo;Will a
man rob God?&rdquo; Yes. Men who
would not wrong each other will defraud
God daily without compunction
and without shame. To allow
the dominion of other lords is a wrong
done to God. 3.&nbsp;<i>Voluntary.</i> It has
been entirely with our own consent.
Those who make this confession mean
that they have been blamable for the
wrongful dominion of other lords.
Freedom is essential to responsibility.
We have consented to sin&mdash;loved it.
Nor does it avail to say we are unable
to break from its power. If unable,
what has brought our moral nature
in to such a state of imbecility? Are
not its chains wound round our nature
by our own consent? Is not the
wretched victim of intemperance responsible
<span class="pagenum" id="p280">[p.&nbsp;280]</span>
for his inability to resist the
cup, when that inability is the result
of the voluntary indulgence of years?
The fetters of the sinner have been
forged by himself. The criminality
reaches farther back than the present
sin; to the sins freely chosen long
ago, which have led up to the present
power of sin over the will. If the
will is in bondage to sin, it was, in
the first instance, voluntarily surrendered.
<i>Now</i> the penitent sinner sees
all this. He comes with lowly submission
and penitential confession.</p>

<p>II. <span class="smcap">A good resolution.</span> &ldquo;By
Thee only will we make mention of
Thy name.&rdquo; The confession of the
ransomed Jews meant more than
empty words. They had seen their
error; they intended a complete
change, a radical reformation. Idolatry
was for ever renounced.</p>

<p>This is a type of the conversion of
a sinner. The confession means not
only that he seeks forgiveness, but
also&mdash;1.&nbsp;<i>Intends reformation</i>&mdash;abandonment
of all sin, no reservation of any
sin, the course of life completely altered.
2.&nbsp;<i>Supposes regeneration.</i> Man
can only see the outward change;
but what does it represent? Awakening
to the danger, sight of the evil of
sin. The disposition is different; the
heart is changed. Hence the will determines
the other way. 3.&nbsp;<i>Proceeds from
God.</i> There is a work of the Holy Spirit
in conversion. We need His help to
fulfil the resolution. &ldquo;By Thee only.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Have you experienced this change?
It is a personal one. Whether you
have or not, He is the Lord&mdash;your
Lord; therefore right that He demands
your service. O yield His
claim!&mdash;<i>J. Rawlinson.</i></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 class="tdc" id="o226"><span class="smcap">Prayer in Trouble.</span></h3>

<p class="bq">xxvi.&nbsp;16. <i>&ldquo;Lord, in trouble,&rdquo; &amp;c.</i></p>

<p>Every man knows what trouble is;
what it is to lie under the chastening
hand of God. In the day of trouble,
we feel our dependence on external
help. Some in adversity seek friends
who they neglect in prosperity.
Happy is he who, when trouble comes,
finds himself surrounded by true
friends. Acquire the art of keeping
your friends. But there are troubles
to which human sympathy and help
are inadequate. Times when men&rsquo;s
thoughts drift towards God. Trouble
reminds us of the unseen, the spiritual,
the external. It quickens the spiritual
sense by casting the fierce light of
eternity on the things of time. Men
visit God in trouble by pouring out to
Him their prayers.</p>

<p><b>I. Some pray in trouble, who are
prayerless at other times.</b> Multitudes
live entirely without prayer. Taught
by mothers in infancy. For a considerable
part of ripening youth they
maintained the habit. But began to
neglect, were afraid of ridicule, or fell
into sinful indulgence; it would appal
them to think how long it is since they
poured out one prayer to God. Surprising
that with God so near, so many
should habitually turn away and never
seek His face. But some heavy trouble
comes. They pause, recollect themselves,
remember the long years of
misspent time, pray, promise and
vow (H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I., 69).</p>

<p>Does this always continue when the
trouble has departed? Is not this often
the history? The cloud breaks, the
sun bursts out again, the man forgets
that the sun was ever hid. Ship in
storm. Cries, prayers, vows. Ship is
saved. Prayers cease; revelry is resumed.
How often on the bed of sickness
are prayers and promises uttered
which are forgotten with returning
health. Pharaoh alarmed by the successive
plagues. Besought Moses to
pray. Hardened his heart again. The
children of Israel repeatedly fell into
idolatry. Visited with judgments.
Cried to the Lord. When punishment
was withdrawn returned to the sin.
Conviction is not conversion; awakening
not repentance. If the heart remains
unchanged, a man will only pray
<span class="pagenum" id="p281">[p.&nbsp;281]</span>
as long as he is alarmed (H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I.,
3877&ndash;3879).</p>

<p><b>II. Some begin to pray in trouble,
and continue to pray afterwards.</b> Many
have had to thank God for trouble.
Borne along the stream of prosperity
towards destruction. Some obstruction.
It was unwelcome. It compelled
examination. It revealed the
yawning falls a little way beyond.
Just in time to return. Every human
soul requires one such grand interruption
in its career. Grace of God employs
various means for its effectuation.
Trouble is one (Hosea v.&nbsp;15). The
soul&rsquo;s deep sin, danger, need, has been
revealed. The cry has gone up to
heaven. It was the cry of true repentance
and humble faith in the
Crucified One. Comes from the trouble
a new man&mdash;a praying man (Manasseh,
2&nbsp;Chron. xxxiii.&nbsp;10&ndash;13. The prodigal
son, Luke xv.&nbsp;14&ndash;21).</p>

<p><b>III. Some pray habitually, but especially
in trouble.</b> Prayer is the special
characteristic of a Christian. It is his
&ldquo;vital breath.&rdquo; He cannot fail to
establish stated seasons of prayer, both
public and private. He endeavours
to maintain the spirit of prayer. By
its aid the blood of the spiritual life
is kept in circulation. An important
sense in which he prays &ldquo;without
ceasing&rdquo; (H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I., 3866&ndash;3879; P.&nbsp;D.,
2839). And every remarkable event
is made the occasion of special prayer.
Certainly trouble is one of these. Do
you not go to God in your sorrows, as a
child goes to his father or his mother?
Bishop Reynolds says: &ldquo;A Godly
heart is like those flowers which shut
when the sun sets, and open again
when the sun returns and shines upon
them. Hannah prayed silently so long
as she was in bitterness of spirit; but
as soon as God answered her prayer
and filled her heart with joy, presently
her mouth was enlarged into a song of
thanksgiving.&rdquo; In trouble you pray,
1.&nbsp;for deliverance, in submission to
the Divine will. 2.&nbsp;More especially
for a sanctified use of trouble; complete
submission, faith, purification
(Phil. iv.&nbsp;6, 7).&mdash;<i>J. Rawlinson.</i></p>

<h3 class="tdc" id="o227"><span class="smcap">National Revival.</span></h3>

<p class="bq">xxvi.&nbsp;19. <i>Thy dead men shall live.</i></p>

<p><b>I. This is the language of</b>
<span class="wsnw"><b>exultation.</b><a id="o227_fna1" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#o227_fn1">[1]</a></span>
In this part of the chapter
the tone changes from sorrow, failure,
and abortion to life, prosperity, and
joy. &ldquo;Thy dead, O Zion, shall live
again.&rdquo; Thy people have been virtually,
civilly, nationally dead, but
they shall have a resurrection. Because
these dead are God&rsquo;s people, their
resurrection from national death is
certain. Then, thrilled with confidence
in this truth, the prophet gives
utterance to the voice of God within
him, &ldquo;Awake and sing, ye that lie
buried in dust, awake; come forth
from your (figurative) graves, and
break out in song as ye come up to
the light of day!&rdquo;</p>

<p><b>II. This expectation involves a contrast.</b>
The resurrection of national
life of God&rsquo;s people stands in contrast
with the denial of resurrection to the
wicked rulers of Babylon (ver. 14).
That Chaldean nation went down to
its political grave with no hope, no
possibility of being raised to national
life again. On the contrary, God&rsquo;s
people, from being in a state of national
death in Babylon, were eventually
called into national life.</p>

<p><b>III. This declaration suggests a
truth which nations ought to learn.</b>
No nation that seeks God and His
righteousness can be permanently kept
down. &ldquo;Righteousness exalteth a
nation;&rdquo; exalteth it from depression
into power. It may be brought low,
but if the elements of rectitude lie
within it, if public justice be a part
of its political creed, and respect for
the rights of others its unvarying
practice, then, though apparently
buried in the grave of defeat and degradation,
its resurrection shall come.
<span class="pagenum" id="p282">[p.&nbsp;282]</span>
God rules not only amid the armies
of heaven, but amongst the inhabitants
of the earth, and to every nation
maintaining justice, mercy, and truth,
though brought ever so low, the voice
of history proclaims, &ldquo;Thy dead men
shall live!&rdquo; The bodies of English
martyrs to the Tudor period perished.
Under the Stuart dynasty the bones
of those English patriots who defied
&ldquo;crowned and mitred tyranny&rdquo; were
dug up and dishonoured. That part
of them corruptible and worthless
died, but the better part of them
has experienced a resurrection. Their
principles live to-day. &ldquo;Thy dead
men shall live.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Henry Cowles, D.D.</i></p>

<div class="footnotes"><h4 class="tdc">FOOTNOTES:</h4>
<div class="footnote" id="o227_fn1"><p><a href="#o227_fna1"><span class="label">[1]</span></a>
This passage proves beyond a question
that the idea of a resurrection from the dead
was familiar to the prophet and to his first
readers, for whose immediate use he wrote.
Sensible writers never borrow figures from
things unknown, but always from things
better known than the facts they would illustrate.
As no writer <i>could</i> draw a figure from
what was unknown to himself, so, if he sought
to teach, he <i>would</i> not draw one from what
was unknown to his readers. As Isaiah could
not talk about a resurrection if he had never
known the idea and the words to express it,
so he would not expect to be understood unless
his readers were also familiar with it.&mdash;<i>Cowles.</i></p></div>

<p>The history of humanity as a whole,
and of nations and communities as a
part, is like that of individual man,
diversified and varying, made up of
hope and fear, of joy and sorrow.
There is a &ldquo;but&rdquo; in every condition,
a crook in every lot. The people of
God, however, have alleviations which
the world knows not of. They have
promises of present comfort and help,
hopes of future recompense, and they
are invited to make God their Refuge

with the captive Jews in Babylon.
Wars and commotions would rage as
a tempest around Babylon, and bring
its overthrow. But while the storm
raged, the people of God were to be
calm and tranquil; were to enter into
their places of retirement, and avoid

Jews, who stood in a peculiar relation to
God. It has now a wider range. It may
include&mdash;1.&nbsp;<i>Those who are His by profession.</i>
This includes a large portion
of the people of this land. Many
of these, however, are out of Christ,
and they are specially invited to repair
to Him as their complete and
only refuge from the storms of conscience
and the righteous displeasure
of a Holy God. 2.&nbsp;<i>Those who are His
by personal consecration.</i> Not only received
into the visible Church by an
outward profession, but have become
living members of that mystical body
of which Christ is the Head. In times
of danger and distress, when the judgments
of God are in the earth, they are
invited to repair to Christ. He is a
complete refuge from every storm.</p>

<p>II. <span class="smcap">The duty enjoined.</span> 1.&nbsp;<i>The form
of the injunction.</i> No terrible threatening,
but mild and compassionate invitation.
Though our Redeemer and
Master has a right to command, yet
He more frequently employs the language
of invitation. 2.&nbsp;<i>The place of
retreat.</i> We may think of many sacred
localities to which we may repair in this
time of national or individual sorrow.
There is the open <i>sanctuary.</i> This to
many is a place of refuge and comfort.
There is the <i>home.</i> Families may meet
and together commune with God. There
is the <i>private closet.</i> There we may
humble ourselves, mourn our own faults
and those of others, and seek God&rsquo;s
favour. But after we have thoughts of
all these places we must go much
further, into a more mysterious and
safer sanctuary. These are only the
<i>way</i> to the City of Refuge; only the
<i>plank</i> by which we may ascend to
the Ark; only the <i>door-way</i> into the
<span class="pagenum" id="p283">[p.&nbsp;283]</span>
Temple. Ours must be the language of
the Apostle (John vi.&nbsp;68). 3.&nbsp;<i>The purpose
of retirement.</i> For defence. Israel
must remain within the blood-sprinkled
doors while the destroying angel wields
his sword outside. Rahab and her
family abide within their dwelling
while Jericho is destroyed. Amid
the tokens of danger and the coming
storm, we are to hide ourselves in the
perfections of God, in the merits of
Christ. We must enter into the ark,
and like Noah expect the Lord to
shut us in. When the Hebrews had
sprinkled the blood of the Paschal
lamb, the command was, &ldquo;None of
you shall go out of his house till the
morning.&rdquo; The manslayer could not
go within the City of Refuge. Here
in Christ, God manifest in the flesh,
is safety from every danger, a complete
Refuge in every time of need.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Conclusion.</span>&mdash;The whole of this
year has been marked more or less by
personal, relative, or national calamity.
It opened in storm, and a fine ship, the
<i>London,</i> perished. Pestilence among
the cattle followed. War broke out and
mercantile prosperity waned. Now a
painful visitation is among us. God
is now calling you to Himself.&mdash;<i>George

<p class="bq">xxvi.&nbsp;20. <i>Enter into thy chambers, &amp;c.</i></p>

<p>The religion of Christ, as a religion
of consolation, is eminently suited to
the condition of men in a sinful, suffering,
and dying world. The same
Saviour who died to save, lives to
bless, saying, <i>&ldquo;Lo, I am with you
always,&rdquo;</i> &amp;c. (Matt. xxviii.&nbsp;20). The same Holy Spirit
sanctifies and comforts. This Scripture
suggests, that in the worst of storms
God&rsquo;s people have a secure hiding-place.</p>

<p>I. <span class="smcap">A consolatory truth implied.</span>
God&rsquo;s people have chambers of security
and defence in time of danger. Every
perfection of the Divine character, every
office of Christ, every Divine promise is
a chamber of defence (Prov. xviii.&nbsp;10).</p>

<p>II. <span class="smcap">A welcome duty enjoined.</span>
&ldquo;Enter,&rdquo; &amp;c. 1.&nbsp;<i>Who gives the invitation?</i>
The Lord Jehovah, with whom
is Everlasting Strength. 2.&nbsp;<i>To whom
this invitation is given,</i> &ldquo;My people.&rdquo;
Not Babylon, not Egypt, but &ldquo;my
people.&rdquo; 3.&nbsp;<i>What it is to which He calls
them.</i> To enter their closets, hold
communion with Him, trust themselves
to His keeping.</p>

<p>III. <span class="smcap">The reasons for this retreat.</span>
1.&nbsp;<i>Because the calamity anticipated
is very great.</i> God comes out of
His place to judge the nations, &amp;c.
2.&nbsp;<i>The season of danger is short.</i> &ldquo;For
a little moment.&rdquo; Self-sacrifice and
self-restraint for Christ&rsquo;s sake will not
last long. 3.&nbsp;<i>Because the blessings promised
are very valuable.</i> Present purity
and peace, future glory, &amp;c.&mdash;<i>Samuel

<h3 class="tdc" id="o230"><span class="smcap">Religious Retirement.</span></h3>

<p class="bq">xxvi.&nbsp;20. <i>Come, my people, enter thou into thy chambers, and shut thy doors
about thee.</i></p>

<p>An exhortation to religious retirement.
Man was intended for society,
but also for contemplation. When
devoted to pious purposes, retirement
is highly useful to man and most acceptable
to God (H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I., 3466&ndash;3525).
It is commended to us both by precept
and example (Gen. xxiv.&nbsp;63; Matt.
xiv.&nbsp;23, &amp;c.) But the retreat which
the Scriptures commend is temporary,
not total; not that of a monk to his
cell, in which he passes his days in
barren and unprofitable speculation,
but that of men living in the world,
who go out of it for a time in order
that they may return to it better fitted
for the duties which God has assigned
them there. That you may be stimulated
to this duty, consider its advantages.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="p284">[p.&nbsp;284]</span>
<b>I. Religious retirement takes off the
impression that the neighbourhood
of evil has a tendency to make
upon the mind.</b> We need often to
escape from it in order that we may
see its true character, and renew our
strength to resist it.</p>

<p><b>II. Religious retirement is favourable
for fixing pious purposes in the
mind, and strengthening our habits
of virtue.</b> Dazzled no longer by the
false glitter of the world, we open
our eyes to the beauties of the better
country; stunned no more with the
noise of folly, we can listen in silence
to the still small voice. At leisure we
can reflect by what temptations we
were formerly foiled, that we may
guard against them in time to come;
for seeing the evil day, we can prepare
ourselves for its conflicts.</p>

<p><b>III. In religious retirement we attain
to self-knowledge.</b> Here wisdom
begins. We can never ascend
to the knowledge of Him whom to
know is life eternal, without knowing
ourselves; and we can never know ourselves
without stripping off whatever is artificial
about us, without throwing off
the veil which we wear before men,
and devoting our sacred hours to
serious consideration.</p>

<p><b>IV. Retirement and meditation will
open up a source of new and better
entertainment than you meet with in
the world</b> (Ps. civ.&nbsp;34).&mdash;<i>John Logan:
Sermons,</i> vol. ii. pp. 156&ndash;164.</p>

<p class="bq">xxvii.&nbsp;4, 5. <i>Fury is not in me, &amp;c.</i></p>

<p>The figurative language in ver. 1
sets forth some powerful and terrible
enemies of Israel&mdash;cruel, crafty, and
bloodthirsty oppressors. But, terrible
as they were to Israel, they were no
more than &ldquo;briers and thorns&rdquo; in the
way of Israel&rsquo;s God. He would
&ldquo;march against them and go through
them,&rdquo; just as soldiers on their march
tread down and crush so frail a barrier
as these would be against them. His
own people the while should be the
object of His special and necessary
care (vers. 2, 3). And if they should
so offend as to draw down His judgments
upon them, still He would not
<span class="pagenum" id="p285">[p.&nbsp;285]</span>
deal with them as adversaries. He
would be ready to make peace with
them again on their humbling themselves
before Him. The solemn disclaimer
of our text should be borne in
mind by us when we study&mdash;</p>

<p>I. <span class="smcap">God&rsquo;s threatenings against
the wicked.</span> Many of these are very
terrible, and a certain class of religionists
would have us believe that
these alarming texts of Holy Scripture
are metaphors that mean nothing, and
that we dishonour &ldquo;the God
and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ&rdquo; if
we associate His name with anything
that savours of wrath, vengeance, and
severity. But this is taking a meagre
and one-sided view of the Divine
Character. In God there is not only
love, but also holiness, which &ldquo;cannot
look upon iniquity;&rdquo; justice, which
&ldquo;will by no means clear the guilty;&rdquo;
and truth, which forewarns and will
not fail to punish the transgressors of
law and order. Let us not mistake
the character of such punishment. A
furious man acts on the passionate
impulse of the moment. He strikes
blindly and without consideration;
does many things which, when the
excitement is over, he will be sorry for
and try to undo. But nothing like
this is there with God. His threatenings
are not uttered in blind and inconsiderate
wrath, but in awful calmness
of judgment, and in vindication of
His essential and eternal holiness;
and thus, too, they will be executed.
This it is that will make the judgment-day
so awful, and that then will reduce
the condemned to despair. The son
who sees his father&rsquo;s anger so stirred
against him, that vain attempt were it
to reason with him, vain to offer a word
of explanation or excuse, does well to
keep out of his father&rsquo;s way, and hope
for a better time to stand before him
and ask to be forgiven. But no
such hope is there, when the offender
sees that his aggrieved parent&mdash;not
furiously, but &ldquo;out of very faithfulness&rdquo;&mdash;is
about to administer a threatened
punishment; ay, and that his heart
is heavy, and his eye dim with tears,
even while he punishes! And this,
allowing for the inevitable weakness
of any illustration of such a matter,
may serve to convey the idea which
I would impress upon you. &ldquo;The
Father of mercies and God of all
comfort&rdquo; will certainly execute His
threatenings against impenitent transgressors.
Not in passionate haste, and
on sudden impulse of which He might
afterwards repent, will the Lord make
&ldquo;a way for His anger&rdquo; against sin.</p>

<p>II. <span class="smcap">The doctrine of the atonement.</span>
Not a few earnest men becloud
and all but explain away this fundamental
doctrine, because (they tell us)
they cannot endure the thought of sin
being punished in the person of the
Sinless One. They do not like to hear
of the Father&rsquo;s &ldquo;wrath&rdquo; being averted
and (as it is said) &ldquo;appeased&rdquo; by the
death of His Son; of God looking out
(as it were) for a victim, and fastening
upon the One found guiltless as a
substitute for the guilty mass! But
this mistaken representation arises
from attributing to God a passion
which in men would be indignation
and wrath. But what does our text
say? &ldquo;<i>Fury</i> is not in <i>Me.</i>&rdquo; We may not
think of our heavenly Father as an
angry Being, furiously raging against
those whom the devil has proved too
strong for, and not to be appeased till
He found a victim on which to wreak
His vengeance! But no unwillingness
on our part to hear it can alter that
which is written (2&nbsp;Cor. v.&nbsp;21; 1&nbsp;Pet.
iv.&nbsp;18; Isa. liii.&nbsp;5, 6). If we study
this great subject aright, we shall find
in the Atonement the result of the
co-working of the calmest (and therefore
most inflexible) justice and the
tenderest love.&mdash;<i>T.&nbsp;W. Peile, D.D.:
Sermons,</i> pp. 101&ndash;112.</p>

<p class="gap" id="o232A">The text expresses the preference
of God for forgiveness rather than
for punishment, and the conditions of
that forgiveness; but, at the same
time, the utter overthrow of all who
continue in opposition to His will.
It suggests&mdash;</p>

<p><b>I. A blessed absence in the nature
of God.</b> &ldquo;Fury is not in me.&rdquo; Fury
seems to be <i>uncontrolled</i> and <i>uncontrollable</i>
<span class="pagenum" id="p286">[p.&nbsp;286]</span>
anger, such as that with which
the storm seems to beat upon the
dismasted, helpless vessel; such as
that which inspires the hungry lion
that has been for some hours disappointed
of its prey. When a man
is so under the influence of anger that
no consideration from within or intercession
from without can pacify
him, he is in a state of <i>fury.</i> But no
such state is possible to our God.
His anger is always under control, He
is always the Lord God, abundant in
goodness and truth; and we have
also plentiful evidence that, in the
height of His displeasure, He is accessible
to intercession on behalf of His
creatures. See how the Son of God
ends His woes against &ldquo;Scribes,
Pharisees, hypocrites,&rdquo; with &ldquo;O Jerusalem,
how often would I have gathered,&rdquo;
&amp;c. Recall the effect of
Abram&rsquo;s pleading for Sodom, and
that of Moses for unbelieving Israel
(Num. xiv.) The declaration of the
text has been abundantly verified in
all ages. Nevertheless,</p>

<p><b>II. This blessed absence in the
nature of God is compatible with contention
with the unrepenting.</b> &ldquo;Who
would set the briers,&rdquo; &amp;c. Imagine a
father and a son at variance, the father
being in the right, and son in the
wrong. There are two ways of reconciliation;
either the son must comply
with the conditions of the father, or
the father must lower his standard to
the level of the son. But what a
wrong would the father do himself,
his family, and society, if he were to
adopt this course! He ought not,
will not. If the son resolves to fight
it out, reconciliation is impossible.
This is the relative position of God
and the ungodly man. God says, &ldquo;I
am Jehovah, I change not.&rdquo; It is a
blessed impossibility. But the unrepentant
man ought, can, must! If
no, the fire of goodness must be set
against the briers of wickedness, a
contest as hopeless, and of which
the issue is as certain, as that of the
devouring flame with briers and
thorns.</p>

<p><i>Conclusion.</i>&mdash;The absence of fury in
God leads Him to prefer pardon to
punishment, and to provide means for
the former. &ldquo;Let him take hold of
my strength,&rdquo; &amp;c. Men, churches,
and nations are lovers of peace in
proportion as they are righteous (Ps.
lxxii.&nbsp;3). The preference of God for
peace depends upon the very attribute
of which the ungodly would rob Him,
His righteousness. What is God&rsquo;s
strength? How take hold of it?
When a man falls overboard at sea,
the appointed means of rescue is the
life-belt which is thrown to him.
Seizing that, he lays hold of the
strength of the vessel to save him.
When the man-slayer, fleeing from the
avenger of blood, entered the city
of refuge, he took hold of God&rsquo;s
appointed means of shelter. God&rsquo;s
strength is His pardoning prerogative,
exercises to us through Christ,
the &ldquo;arm&rdquo; or &ldquo;strength&rdquo; of the
Lord. See how Moses takes hold of
it (Num. xiv.&nbsp;19). And the prodigal
(Luke xv.&nbsp;21; Rom. v.&nbsp;1).&mdash;<i>Horace
Bushnell, D.D.</i></p>

<span class="wsnw"><i>&amp;c.</i><a id="o233_fna1" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#o233_fn1">[1]</a></span></p>

<p>I. <span class="smcap">In what God&rsquo;s strength consists.</span>
First, as we think of Almightiness,
that irresistible power which
created the world, &amp;c. We are apt
to forget those other and higher
sources of strength which belong to
God (1&nbsp;Kings xix.&nbsp;12). Wisdom is
strength (Eccles. ix.&nbsp;15, 16). Truthfulness
is strength. Justice is power.
Mercy to the weak is often the manifestation
of the highest strength.
England has often put forth her power;
her soldiers have crushed the most
appalling rebellions; her guns have
sunk the mightiest navies; but history
will perhaps record it as the highest
display of her power when, under a
sense of justice, she withdrew her
forces when she might have crushed
her foes (as in the late Transvaal war,
<span class="pagenum" id="p287">[p.&nbsp;287]</span>
1881). Now, this element of mercy,
as manifest in the work of Christ, is
God&rsquo;s strength (Rom. i.&nbsp;16; 1&nbsp;Cor. i.&nbsp;24).
God&rsquo;s fatherly love is the essence of His
power (H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I., 3206). Christ is the
expression of that love. Christ is
God&rsquo;s strength. &ldquo;And let him take
hold of My strength.&rdquo;</p>

<p>II. <span class="smcap">How may man take hold of
God&rsquo;s strength?</span> 1.&nbsp;By <i>submission</i>
(Rom. vi.&nbsp;13; Ps. li.&nbsp;10). As nothing
is so reasonable, so nothing is so wise
as submission to God. 2.&nbsp;By <i>prayer.</i>
Prayer is the hand of the child stretching
itself under that father&rsquo;s protecting
power. Prayer takes hold of God&rsquo;s
strength. 3.&nbsp;By <i>obedience</i> (1&nbsp;Pet. i.&nbsp;14).
When Saul of Tarsus, after asking,
&ldquo;Lord what wilt Thou have me
to do?&rdquo; went straightway and did
God&rsquo;s will, then there came to him a
moral power mightier than he had
ever wielded before. 4.&nbsp;By <i>implicit
trust in God&rsquo;s</i>
<span class="wsnw"><i>mercy</i>.<a id="o233_fna2" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#o233_fn2">[2]</a></span></p>

<p>III. <span class="smcap">The result of thus taking
hold of God&rsquo;s strength.</span> The result
is that Divine strength is infused into
our minds. We become &ldquo;strong in
the Lord, and in the power of His
might.&rdquo; Trust is the medium through
which God&rsquo;s power is transmitted to
man&rsquo;s weakness (Heb. vi.&nbsp;19). We
can only really know those whom we
love and trust (Dan. xi.&nbsp;32). The
most invincible and lasting institution
in the world is the Church of Christ,
because composed of those who are
&ldquo;partakers of the Divine nature,&rdquo; and
whom God has made strong.&mdash;<i>William
Parkes, F.R.G.S.</i></p>

<p>It did not often happen to ancient
nations to rise into new vigour after
being conquered and removed. Ancient
Assyria and Babylon fell, and
their influence faded. But it was
otherwise with Israel. They had
flourished; abused their trust; were
punished by being conquered and removed.
But they did not perish.
From the Babylonian grave they rose.
Centuries longer they existed, until
their crowning sin. No further need
for their national existence. It ceased.
But their separate identify as a race
continued. The Jew is everywhere.
Everywhere he is a witness to the
truth of the Bible. And the <i>influence</i>
of the Jewish people continues. The
influence of the classic writers of
Greece and Rome continues. Their
study is essential to a liberal education.
But only the few enjoy that
advantage. The literature of the Jewish
race was confined almost entirely
to their sacred books. But how wide
its influence! Read by the scholar
and the peasant, &amp;c. Lifts men&rsquo;s
thoughts above the level of this world,
and presents a loftier ideal of human
character than any of the mere &ldquo;thinkers&rdquo;
of ancient or modern times.</p>

<p>Nor is it only the perpetuation and
influence of a literature. It is the perpetuation
of a type of moral life. One
who came of Jacob has exerted and is
exerting an influence never equalled.
Born in a manger, trained in poverty,
dying on a cross, He has been and is
<span class="pagenum" id="p288">[p.&nbsp;288]</span>
the fountain of spiritual life to millions.
In him they have become a new seed
of Jacob (Gal. iii.&nbsp;29).</p>

<p>The text foretells the stability,
the growth, and the diffusion of the
Church.</p>

<p>I. <span class="smcap">Its stability.</span> <i>&ldquo;Take rest.&rdquo;</i>
This is necessary to <i>growth.</i> And <i>life</i>
is necessary to <i>it.</i> You may plant a
stone, or a piece of dried wood, but it
can never take root. Why? It wants
the mysterious principle called life.
Reasons for this. And the roots are
the firmest part of the plant. Hence
the metaphor&mdash;a man is rooted in his
position. Fine forest-tree with roots,
like arms, many feet on every side.
Impossible to dislodge that tree. This
is one of the emblems of the stability
of the Christian&rsquo;s spiritual position
(Col. ii.&nbsp;7). Thus the stability of the
Church, the aggregate of spiritual men,
is set forth in the text. It has struck
its roots so deep, and spread them so
far, that, as hitherto, so in the future, it
shall continue. Storms of opposition,
persecution, infidelity unable to uproot
it. &ldquo;The gates of hell shall not
prevail.&rdquo;</p>

<p>II. <span class="smcap">Its growth.</span> Rooting of a tree
only valuable in relation to its continued
life and growth. Look at it in the individual
member of the spiritual Israel.
In the living tree in spring the bud
breaks forth, then the beautiful blossom&mdash;promise
of the fruit. So in the
Christian life. Gradually it develops
by a certain though irregular progression.
Nor will this promise of fruitfulness
be falsified (Gal. v.&nbsp;22, 23;
Rom. vi.&nbsp;22; Ps. xcii.&nbsp;13, 14; H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I.,
2508&ndash;2516, 2538&ndash;2544). Multiply
this by the number of living members
in any Church, and how much of
spiritual goodness, and beauty will be
in that circle! Not only within it,
but in the homes, among the neighbours,
over the whole sphere of their
influence. Then multiply this by all
the Churches. What an amount of
moral beauty thus in the world!</p>

<p>III. <span class="smcap">Its diffusion.</span> <i>&ldquo;And fill the
face of the world with fruit.&rdquo;</i> This
vision was always present to the
prophet&rsquo;s eye. Suppose it realised, and
the whole world converted. Then the
world will be filled with goodness.
But it is all in the spiritual succession
from Jacob. How much comes of
little! So it has ever been; small
beginnings, gradual growth, great endings.</p>

<p>Do you say you cannot believe in
the world&rsquo;s conversion? Do you believe
the harvest comes from the seed?
That Jesus multiplied the loaves? Is
anything too hard for the Lord?&mdash;<i>J.

<h3 class="tdc" id="o235"><span class="smcap">The Day of the East Wind.</span></h3>

<p class="bq">xxvii.&nbsp;8. <i>In measure, when Thou sendest it forth, &amp;c.</i> (<i>Margin</i>).</p>

<p>We have often complained of the
bitterness and depressing effects of
the &ldquo;east wind.&rdquo; In Bible lands it
was scorching and destructive (Job
xxi.&nbsp;18; xxvii.&nbsp;12; Gen. xli.&nbsp;6).
Israel is represented in this chapter
as a vineyard, of which God was the
proprietor and guardian (ver. 3). The
removal of the people to Babylon
seemed to contradict this declaration.
They presented the appearance of a
vineyard uncared for, forsaken, neglected,
and spoiled. The east wind,
sweeping over it, marred its beauty
and checked its growth, and its desolation
seemed complete. The question
arises, Does God really mean
what He says when He engages to
keep His vineyard with continued
care? In reply to this question the
prophet speaks here. He justifies
the ways of God to man, explaining
the Divine procedure, and showing
the purpose of that afflictive dispensation
which He visited upon His beloved
vineyard. What a consoling
subject, is here presented,&mdash;the
trials of the godly (1),&nbsp;in their
<span class="pagenum" id="p289">[p.&nbsp;289]</span>
severity, and (2),&nbsp;in their mitigation.</p>

<p>I. <span class="smcap">The severity of Christian
Trial.</span> Our seasons of sharp distress
and loss are fitly set forth as <i>&ldquo;the day
of the east wind,&rdquo;</i> biting and piercing,
when the heart is joyless and depressed.
God, who sends it, means
us to feel its keenness. The severity
of our trials appears&mdash;1.&nbsp;<i>In the time
when they overtake us.</i> The east wind
prevails with us in the early spring.
So in our experience of life, when all
is full of fair promise, our hopes are
blasted. A young and tender faith is
often sorely tested. We would push
adversity into old age, with youth as
a course of uninterrupted joy; but at
the most unlikely periods the day of
the east wind sweeps over us. 2.&nbsp;<i>In
their violence.</i> The wind of adversity
seems to us cruel and devastating.
We speak of a reverse or bereavement
as &ldquo;a sad blow.&rdquo; 3.&nbsp;<i>In their
continuance.</i> We could tolerate an
occasional day of east wind, but when
it blows persistently for weeks, we begin
to grumble. Afflictions sometimes
follow each other in rapid succession.
The night of weeping is long and dark,
and it seems as if the morning of joy
would never break (H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I., 52, 53).
4.&nbsp;Because of <i>the aspect in which God
appears to us when we are under them.</i>
He seems to be contending, &ldquo;debating&rdquo;
with us, to be opposed to us.
This gives the keenest poignancy to
our griefs. How unworthy, often, is
the view we form of God&rsquo;s character
in the day of the east wind, charging
Him with partiality and injustice.
Of all ingredients that embitter the
cup of suffering, this is the most
bitter, but it is an ingredient which
the sufferer puts in with his own
hand. As in the time of east winds weak
and cheerless people fall into dull,
moody fits, the sighing breezes chiming
in with the dull music of their
own spirits, so in the day of adversity
the soul sometimes loses its sense of
the Divine Love.</p>

<p>II. <span class="smcap">The mitigating, alleviating
circumstances.</span> 1.&nbsp;The day of the
east wind is <i>well timed.</i> It blows at
the right season, in the early spring.
It may nip a few opening buds, but if
it did not come out then, it would retard
vegetation to a fatal extent afterwards.
The youth may complain of
his hard struggle, but it nurses a
manly character. 2.&nbsp;Trial is <i>limited
in its duration.</i> The east wind does
not blow all the year round. These
cold blasts usher in the spring.
3.&nbsp;<i>God moderates its severity.</i> &ldquo;In measure&rdquo;
(1&nbsp;Cor. x.&nbsp;13). Sorrow is
nicely adjusted to the heart on which
it falls (H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I., 187, 188). 4.&nbsp;The
following verse suggests a further alleviation,
viz.:&mdash;<i>The gracious purpose
accomplished by trial,</i> to purge iniquity,
and take away sin. God appoints our
sorrow for the uprooting of our sin.
The physician finds it necessary to
adopt sharp measures, but his operation
is wise and kind. A proneness
to idolatry was Israel&rsquo;s sin, and, to
check this, the nation is sent into
exile. Though He removed it with
&ldquo;His rough wind in the day of His
east wind,&rdquo; the fruit or effect was to
uproot a besetting sin (H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I., 85&ndash;89,
116, 211). 5.&nbsp;Another mitigating
circumstance is found in verse 7. <i>God
makes a distinction between His people
and the world.</i> Great as Israel&rsquo;s sufferings
were, the judgments which descended
on their enemies were far
more terrible, not corrective, but destructive
(1&nbsp;Cor. xi.&nbsp;32). The surly
blasts of the east wind may howl and
chafe and spend their rage on God&rsquo;s
vineyard, but they are only the last
remnants of the dreary winter. To
those who are in covenant with God
every wind that blows is charged with
blessing (H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I., 108).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Concluding Remarks.</span> 1.&nbsp;When
the east wind of trial begins to blow
upon us, let us hasten, not to blame
God, but to examine and blame ourselves.
Though trials are not always
punitive, or even corrective, they are
very frequently so; and in our case,
as in that of Israel, the reason why
the east wind is blowing probably is
because there is iniquity in us that
needs to be purged away (ver. 8; H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I.,
114). 2.&nbsp;When the east wind
<span class="pagenum" id="p290">[p.&nbsp;290]</span>
is blowing upon us, instead of murmuring
let us recall the mitigating
circumstances of which I have reminded
you, and let us thank God
that He loves us too much to leave us
under the power of iniquity (Heb. xii.&nbsp;5&ndash;10;
H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I., 162&ndash;165).&mdash;<i>William
Guthrie, M.A.</i></p>

<h3 class="tdc" id="o236"><span class="smcap">The Afflictions of God&rsquo;s People.</span></h3>

<p class="bq">xxvii.&nbsp;7&ndash;9. <i>Hath He smitten him as He smote his smiter, or was he slain as his
slayers were slain? In exact measure, when dismissing her, Thou didst contend
with her; He scared her away with His rough blast in the day of the east
wind. Therefore on these terms</i> [or, hereby] <i>shall the guilt of Jacob be
purged, and this shall be all the fruit of taking away his sin, when he maketh
all the altar-stones like lime-stones dashed in pieces, that Ash&eacute;ras and sun-images
rise up no more.&mdash;Cheyne.</i></p>

<p>This is a continuation of the song
of the vineyard (vers. 2&ndash;6). That song
was to be sung after deliverance from
disasters which had come upon God&rsquo;s
chosen people, as the chastisement of
their sins. The prophet here pauses to
reflect and to instruct them. His instructions
are of exceeding value to
us, for God acts on the same principles
in every age.</p>

<p>I. <span class="smcap">God&rsquo;s people are often severely
afflicted.</span></p>

<p>They fail in duty, or they even
transgress His commandments. Then
they certainly suffer. Utter is the
delusion that <i>they</i> may sin with impunity.
Unlike human parents, God
never spoils His children; He has no
foolish fondness for them that would
lead Him to be blind to or tolerant of
their faults. On the contrary, sin in
them is most grievous to Him (H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I.,
4563&ndash;4570), and the chastisement
thereof is certain and often severe
(Amos iii.&nbsp;2). Terrible was the punishment
which Isaiah foresaw would come
upon Israel&mdash;deportation to the land
of their conquerors. In that calamity
what varied and awful sufferings were
involved! So it is still! there is
severity as well as mercy in the God
we serve. Because he loves us, He
will not allow us to go on to ruin unchecked.
By terrible calamities, if
need be, He will arrest us in the path
to perdition.</p>

<p>II. <span class="smcap">In the severest afflictions
wherewith God visits His people
His mercy is manifest.</span></p>

<p>Manifest, 1.&nbsp;<b>In the fact that they
befall them here and now.</b> How
kind in Him, not to stand silently
by, and leave them to go on unchecked
to ruin! Remember, the sinner has
no claim upon the mercy of God in
any form. 2.&nbsp;<b>In the restraint with
which they are measured</b>
<span class="wsnw"><b>out.</b><a id="o236_fna1" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#o236_fn1">[1]</a></span>
There is no passion or vindictiveness
in God&rsquo;s dealings with them that provoke
Him to anger. Though His
chastisements may seem to burst
upon the backslider like a hurricane
of east wind, in reality mercy controls
and directs the storm. &ldquo;In
exact measure,&rdquo; <span class="wsnw">&amp;c.<a id="o236_fna2" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#o236_fn2">[2]</a></span>
Because it is
so exactly measured out by mercy,
(1)&nbsp;<i>it always falls short of the guilt of the
sinner.</i> Did justice measure it out, so
that it should be commensurate with
the guilt of the transgressor, it would
mean destruction. This is seen in
the case of the enemies of God. Persistent
ungodliness is visited at length,
not with chastisement, but with judgment,
<i>i.e.,</i> utter ruin (note the picture
of the doom of Babylon in verses 10,
11). So that when God&rsquo;s erring
people have been chastened most
severely, His prophets can put to
them Isaiah&rsquo;s question in verse 7. To
it they can only return the answer
given in Ps. ciii.&nbsp;10. (2)&nbsp;<i>It always
falls short of the transgressor&rsquo;s power of
endurance</i> (H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I., 180, 187). When
it is ended, he still lives&mdash;lives to bless
the hand that smote him (Ps. cxix.&nbsp;71,
75, 67). 3.&nbsp;<b>In the motive that inspires
them all.</b> By them God seeks,
not the destruction of His erring people,
but their deliverance. Israel was held
<span class="pagenum" id="p291">[p.&nbsp;291]</span>
in the degrading bondage of idolatry;
the terrible calamites of the captivity
were the strokes by which He brake
their fetters. When the discipline was
over, they hated idolatry in all its
forms; all the altar-stones in which
they had delighted were &ldquo;like lime-stones
dashed in pieces,&rdquo; and the
Ash&eacute;rahs and sun-images rose in their
midst no more. It is the same motive
that inspires Him in all His afflictive
dealings with His people to-day (H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I.,
56&ndash;59, 66&ndash;74). Therefore, if He is
visiting us with afflictions,&mdash;1.&nbsp;Let us
not be rebellious, but submissive
(H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I., 158). 2.&nbsp;Let us be moved
to penitential self-examination (H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I.,
145&ndash;147). 3.&nbsp;Let us give heartfelt
thanks to God because He is resolved
to make us like Himself (Heb. xii.&nbsp;10;
H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I., 162&ndash;165).</p>

<p class="bq">xxvii.&nbsp;9. <i>By this, therefore, shall the iniquity of Jacob be purged;
and this is all the fruit to take away his sin.</i></p>

<p>The history of God&rsquo;s ancient people
is a Divine teaching. He had brought
them into special relations to Himself,
and had conferred on them special
privileges. They were intended to be
witnesses for Him in the world. To a
large extent they failed. Instead of
persistent faithfulness to their mission,
they repeatedly fell into idolatrous
practices. Punishment came. They
repented. But when the impression
was gone, they renewed the sin. For
centuries this continued, until the
captivity. Then they finally renounced
idolatry. This was the
Divine design in permitting that disaster
to befall them. The prophet
foretold it with suggestive accuracy.
&ldquo;By this shall the iniquities of Jacob
be purged,&rdquo; &amp;c.</p>

<p>Their conduct, and the Divine dealing
with them, finds its parallel in the
history of the modern Church. The
parallel holds&mdash;</p>

<p>I. <span class="smcap">With regard to their sin.</span></p>

<p>The spiritual Jacob sins. Saintly
individuals, here and there, whose conduct
is an honour to the gospel; but
comparatively limited number. Many
who in youth felt strongly have seriously
declined from the warmth of
their first love. Instead of keeping
themselves from the world, they are
under its influence; like imperfect
swimmers, who get within the power
of a wave and find they have neither
strength nor skill to cope with it.
They listen to the sentiments of the
world on matters of religion and morality.
By little and little they conform.
Like Samson, when shorn of
his locks, they become weak as other
men. From contentment with imperfection
they become reconciled to positive
sin. Sometimes they even exceed
their teachers. Christian professors
who have declined into sinful ways
often become worse than those from
whom they have taken their lesson.</p>

<p>And does not God hate sin in them
as He hates it in others? A man&rsquo;s
standing in Christ is nothing, if he is
living in wilful sin. It deadens his
conscience, interrupts his communion
with God, exposes him to the peril of
final apostasy and perdition. Read
the former as well as the latter part of
1&nbsp;John i.&nbsp;7. (H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I., 4563&ndash;4570.)</p>

<p>II. <span class="smcap">With regard to the discipline
of sin.</span></p>

<p>The discipline God sent to the Jewish
people was&mdash;</p>

<p>1. <i>Severe.</i> It seemed hard to be
driven from their beautiful city to a
foreign land, possibly to be absorbed
in its population or held in slavery.
Nor had they the consolation of knowing
<span class="pagenum" id="p292">[p.&nbsp;292]</span>
that they had not brought it on
themselves. God knows how to regulate
the severity of suffering according
to all the facts that must be taken into
account, and all the ends that are to
be served. However severe our sufferings,
we are compelled to admit that
they are always less than we deserve.
But if His strokes are to be felt, they
must sometimes be severe.</p>

<p>2. <i>Punitive.</i> God punished Jacob
for his sin; but He did not cast him
off. His disapprobation of sin had
been shown in words; now it must be
shown by punishment (Hos. xii.&nbsp;2).
The sufferings of God&rsquo;s people are
sometimes trials of faith. But they
are often punishments. When a
parent inflicts punishment, does he
mean that he has disowned his child?
Does it not spring from and prove the
relation between them? God punishes
as a father: and because He is a
father. But this is different from
allowing the penal consequences of sin
to fall fully on them. That would be
disownment, perdition. He fulfils His
word (Ps. lxxxix.&nbsp;30&ndash;37. H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I.,
56&ndash;59, 66&ndash;70).</p>

<p>3. <i>Corrective.</i> &ldquo;Purged; and this
is all the fruit, to take away his sin.&rdquo;
No man&rsquo;s suffering can atone for his
sin. That comes another way. The
Divine One has atoned. Here repentance,
reformation is contemplated. As
when the husbandman prosecutes his
labours he aims to produce the fruit,
so God&rsquo;s design in His people&rsquo;s troubles
is to take away their sin. A rough
method; but necessary. The wild
storm damages but purifies. The
vine-dresser cuts off branches that the
tree may bear more fruit. The sharp
frosts of affliction kill the weeds of sin.
The medicine is distasteful, but it attacks
and dislodges the disease.</p>

<p>But have afflictions invariably this
effect? No. Sometimes received in
a rebellious spirit; God not recognised
in them; thoughtfulness not encouraged;
the heart is hardened; comfort
is sought from pernicious sources; the
soul is driven further from God and
deeper into sin.</p>

<p>But when trouble is sanctified&mdash;(1.)&nbsp;<i>It
suggests serious thoughtfulness.</i> How
has it come? From God? Why?
Sin. Our moral instincts point to
retribution. Perhaps some particular
sin. May be an immediate connection
of the punishment&mdash;with intemperance
for instance, or fraudulent business
transactions. There will be self-examination.
God, responsibility, eternity
will be realised. (2.)&nbsp;<i>It produces
self-humiliation.</i> Confession of sin.
Penitential cry for mercy at the cross.
Renewed self-dedication. (3.)&nbsp;<i>It reawakens
spiritual life.</i> It is a reason for
the reception of fresh impetus. New
earnestness in the culture of holiness;
new watchfulness against evil. Like
a child corrected.</p>

<p>Then if troubles surround you&mdash;(1.)&nbsp;Be
conscious of God&rsquo;s hand. Look beyond
the secondary causes. (2.)&nbsp;Justify
God in His dealing. (3.)&nbsp;Be
patient; wait His time. (4.)&nbsp;Study
His design in sending the trouble.
And unite with Him for the accomplishment
of that design (H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I., 143&ndash;154).&mdash;<i>J. Rawlinson.</i></p>

roll-call. That done, they went to

will come. The shadows will gather,
and we must go to the white tents of

<span class="wsnw"><i>&amp;c.</i><a id="o240_fna1" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#o240_fn1">[1]</a></span></p>

<p>Ephraim one of the most important
of the tribes. It occupied some of the
richest land, about the middle of Palestine.
When the ten tribes formed a
separate kingdom, Ephraim was the
principal tribe in it. Hence the new
<span class="pagenum" id="p294">[p.&nbsp;294]</span>
kingdom was sometimes called Ephraim.
Its capital Samaria, here called
&ldquo;the crown of pride.&rdquo; It was a position
of great natural strength. Its
situation exceedingly beautiful. The
sides of the hill on which it was built
sloped down to rich valleys, covered
with beautiful flowers and fruit-bearing
trees. &ldquo;Glorious beauty.&rdquo; &ldquo;Fat
valleys.&rdquo; No wonder the people were
proud of it. When this prophecy was
written, it was at the height of its
pride. But it was doomed. The glorious
beauty was a fading flower. The
crown of pride was to be trodden under
feet. Samaria was a delicious morsel
for the invader, plucked and eaten as
soon as seen. Shalmanezer, with the
Assyrian host, invaded, overcame, carried
the people away, never to return.
Unlike Judah in this respect. An unsolved
problem to this day, where are
the ten tribes? do they still exist, or
are they entirely extinct?</p>

<p>It was because of sin. The story of
Samaria&rsquo;s idolatry. To tamper with
idolatry was to renounce allegiance
to Jehovah. But that was not all.
Serious moral obliquities came in the
wake of idolatry. Among these was
intemperance. Had become a crying
sin. Was helping to drag the nation
down to ruin. &ldquo;Woe to the crown of
pride,&rdquo; &amp;c.</p>

<p>Here is a warning to England.
England&rsquo;s crying sin is Samaria&rsquo;s
crying sin. God forbid that England
should persist in it, so as to bring on
herself Samaria&rsquo;s doom! Mark&mdash;</p>

<p>I. <span class="smcap">Its Sinfulness.</span> It was treated
as sin in the case of Samaria. It is
still a sin, as well as a vice and a crime.
Keep to the text in pointing out its
sinfulness. Drunkards described as
&ldquo;them that are overcome with wine.&rdquo;
Not a trifling thing to be overcome.
The drunkard allows a thing he loves
to overcome him and rob him of that
for the safe keeping of which he is responsible
to God. He is under obligation
to keep himself for God, and he
betrays his trust. What is overcome?</p>

<p>1. <i>Reason.</i> A great trust. Bound to
use it to the best of our ability; therefore
to keep it in efficient working
order so far as it lies in our power.
If you lent a man a tool, or a machine,
you would require him to keep it from
injury. But strong drink contends with
and overcomes reason. You attach no
importance to opinions expressed or
reasonings attempted by a drunken
man. His reason has been overcome
by his own consent. He could not
have been overcome if he had refused
to play with the enemy.</p>

<p>2. <i>Conscience.</i> Is not conscience a
sacred trust? Sentry at the door of
character. Shall the sentry be drugged
when the enemy is near? Does not
intemperance stupefy the conscience?
Many a man who once would have
dreaded a sin more than a blow has
become regardless of sin, regardless
of God. Not only does intoxication
deaden the sense of its own criminality;
it lowers the moral tone as to
everything else. The moral nature
becomes enfeebled. Any other temptation
more likely to succeed. By
little and little comes over the soul a
tendency to make light of every kind
of sin. Communion with God is
broken off. Prayer is dull and comfortless
exercise when the excitement
of intemperance has become attractive.
The religious nature becomes dead or
maudlin under the influence of drunkenness.
Alas! that men should undermine
and disable their noblest faculty!
(H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I., 4498).</p>

<p>3. <i>Physical strength.</i> Are not our
bodies also entrusted to us to keep
safely for the uses the Maker intends?
If the suicide who takes his own life
by a single stroke rushes into the presence
of his Judge uncalled, must not
the man who by negligence, folly, or
vice, shortens his life answer for it in
the same way? But the drunkard does
this by being overcome with wine.</p>

<p>II. <span class="smcap">Its Penalty.</span> There was a worm
at the root of the glorious beauty, and
fruitfulness, and pride of Ephraim;
and therefore it was a fading flower.
The worm was their sinfulness. The
drunkard may say that he is prosperous
to-day; but the worm is at the root.</p>

<p>1. Look at the consequences to
himself. The <i>deteriorated character,</i>
<span class="pagenum" id="p295">[p.&nbsp;295]</span>
lowered tastes, lowered company of
many a well-educated and splendid
young man, and many a beautiful
promising boy. <i>The social degradation.</i>
&ldquo;Trodden down.&rdquo; Avoided
and despised by former associates.
<i>The ruined circumstances.</i> Gradually
downwards, and finally at the depth
of poverty. <i>The Lost Eternity.</i> &ldquo;No
inheritance.&rdquo; 2.&nbsp;Look at the consequences
to his family. Wife unhappy.
Children uneducated and untrained.
Home impoverished and desolate.
There is a skeleton in that house.
3.&nbsp;Look at the consequences to society.
Drunkards usually seek society. Their
example influences others.</p>

<p>How to cure? How to prevent?
1.&nbsp;<i>Legislation.</i> Can the legislature do
nothing more than it has done?
What of Sunday closing? What of
music saloons? What of limitation of
the hours? What of diminishing the
number of houses? What of abolition
of the traffic? 2.&nbsp;<i>Abstinence.</i>
Urge it on drunkards as their only
chance of recovery. On the young as
their best security. On Christians as
the most effective protest and influential
example. 3.&nbsp;<i>Religion.</i> Realise
the sinfulness of intemperance. Let
the grace of God reign over thoughts,
appetites, habits.&mdash;<i>J. Rawlinson.</i></p>

<p class="bq">xxviii.&nbsp;5, 6. <i>In that day shall the</i> <span class="smcap">Lord</span>
<i>of Hosts be for you a crown, &amp;c.</i></p>

<p>This sustaining assurance stands
in striking antithesis to the solemn
threatenings and humbling charges
which precede and follow it. It rises
like some stately palace amid the ruins
of man&rsquo;s humbled pride and broken
hopes. This voice comes from heaven
in the very hour of earth&rsquo;s desolation
and decay. The prominent figure on
the prophet&rsquo;s canvas is very unlike the
objects grouped around it. On the
one side you look into a lovely valley,
in the centre of which, on a commanding
height, stands Samaria, the capital
of the &ldquo;Ten Tribes,&rdquo; &ldquo;the crown of
pride,&rdquo; &ldquo;the glorious beauty.&rdquo; But
that proud crown is soon to be cast to
the ground; that &ldquo;glorious beauty&rdquo;
is but a garland of fading flowers;
that luxuriant valley, whose very
&ldquo;fatness&rdquo; was made the minister of
sensual indulgence, will soon be overswept
by the desolating march of the
Assyrian invader; that gaudy splendour,
the boast of Ephraim&rsquo;s drunkards,
is as short-lived as the wreaths
which the revellers bind around their
brows. The worm of intemperance is
gnawing at the root of &ldquo;the fading
flower,&rdquo; and overhead the storm is
gathering that will blight its beauty.
Turn now to the other side of the
central figure, where the kingdom of
Judah is introduced (ver. 7). Jerusalem
as well as Samaria has her
troops of reckless inebriates and her
scenes of disgusting intoxication;
though her punishment is not so near
as that of the northern kingdom, here,
too, are seen the marks of sure decline.
On both sides, then, the prophet&rsquo;s
picture is gloomy and portentous&mdash;the
earth a scene of drunken
revelry, and the black sky streaked
with the lightnings of Divine wrath.
But out of this sombre background of
sottish intemperance and overhanging
judgment, of falling crowns and fading
wreaths, rises the luminous figure of
our text. &ldquo;In that day&rdquo; of vanishing
glory &ldquo;shall the Lord of Hosts,&rdquo; &amp;c.
In the fulness of its wealth this promise
belongs to us; the Lord of Hosts
has become to us &ldquo;a crown of glory.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I. <span class="smcap">The believer&rsquo;s dignity.</span></p>

<p>Let
us not tone down the grandeur of the
promise. Christ is the crown with
which the believer is invested. He
is an heir of God, a partaker of the
Divine nature. Let us see what is
implied in this representation, bearing
in mind the crown to which it stands
in contrast. 1.&nbsp;It is a crown of
<i>honour without insecurity.</i> Man is like
a discrowned and exiled king (Lam.
v.&nbsp;16). But God has taken means to
<span class="pagenum" id="p296">[p.&nbsp;296]</span>
restore him his lost dignity (1&nbsp;Cor.
i.&nbsp;30). The crown of original righteousness
which sin has torn from our
brows and trampled in the dust has
been replaced by the righteousness of
Christ. How complete and glorious
is His work in our behalf, to what
dignity does He raise us! This crown
cannot be placed on our head without
inspiring us with a sense of honour,
a feeling of recovered power, of joy
and hope and security. There may
be a crowned head without a kingly
heart. A young prince may mount
the throne incapable of discharging
its duties, or, perhaps, trembling lest
his new dignity should make him a
mark for the bullet of the assassin;
but the Christian&rsquo;s honour cometh
from God, and, along with the restored
kingship, kingly qualities are imparted,
so that no man can take his crown.
2.&nbsp;This is a crown in which we may
<i>boast without pride.</i> Samaria was a
crown of pride to the Ephraimites,
and because they gloried in it, it was
soon to be overturned. But while
this crown of carnal confidence was
thus to be swept away, God becomes
to His people a more glorious crown
in which they might boast without
pride. When anything short of God
is made our confidence it fosters vainglory,
but with God as our crown all
self-sufficiency is excluded. 3.&nbsp;It is a
crown of <i>joy without degradation.</i> As
it does not foster pride, so neither
does it allow its wearer to descend to
low indulgence. Reference is probably
made to the wreath of flowers
worn by drunken revellers on festive
occasions. Under the plea of festive
mirth they wallowed in the mire of
sensuality. How soon their garlands
would fall in disorder <i>from</i> their heads,
or fall <i>with</i> their heads as they lay in
senseless intoxication. The believer&rsquo;s
&ldquo;diadem of beauty&rdquo; points to purity
and self-control (Ps. iv.&nbsp;7). 4.&nbsp;It is
an <i>unfading</i> crown. This point in the
contrast is equally obvious. And is
not &ldquo;the fading flower&rdquo; an emblem of
all our earthly joys?</p>

<p class="bqpoemr">&ldquo;All that sweet was made, but to be lost when sweetest.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This world&rsquo;s fairest chaplets will
soon wither on our brows; its honours,
possessions, and hopes are evanescent;
but the Lord will be our everlasting
crown, our God will be our eternal
glory (H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I., 4975&ndash;4989).</p>

<p>II. <span class="smcap">The believer&rsquo;s power.</span></p>

<p>In ver. 6 we have all the elements
of personal power, social well-being,
and national greatness (Acts i.&nbsp;8; Eph.
v.&nbsp;18). The indwelling Spirit confers
three benefits. 1.&nbsp;<i>A clear head.</i> &ldquo;A
spirit of judgment.&rdquo; Solomon asked
this blessing. It does not fall to many
of us to sit on the bench, but what is
good for the judge is a precious gift
for all. When the Spirit pours His
light upon the mind, the eyes of our
understanding are enlightened. A
clear intellect, a sound mind, an unwarped,
unprejudiced judgment, is
needed in all walks of life. How appropriate
is this part of the promise!
How could justice be rightly administered
in such a state of society as that
described by the prophet? If there is
one thing that saps the morals, and
muddles the understanding, it is intemperance.
Men in positions of responsibility
need all their wits about
them. 2.&nbsp;<i>A brave heart</i> is promised
&ldquo;to them who turn the tide of battle
to the gate.&rdquo; The soldier as well as
the judge is to participate in the gifts
of God&rsquo;s spirit. We have a spiritual
warfare to wage (Eph. iv.&nbsp;12), and we
are pledged to conquer the world for
Christ. Beware lest we render ourselves
unfit for military service by
luxurious habits, and sinful indulgence.
The drunkards of Ephraim
could do nothing to oppose the invaders
of their country. We need
the Spirit to fire our hearts with courage
and enterprise. Without His influence
we shall prove poltroons.
3.&nbsp;<i>A strong arm.</i> Self-denial is a source
of moral courage and of spiritual
strength. Far from us be the dissoluteness
which enfeebles our powers,
both of mind and body.</p>

<p>Such, then, are the contents of this
precious promise. Oh, that we were
all invested with this crown of holiness,
dignity, and beauty. How many
<span class="pagenum" id="p297">[p.&nbsp;297]</span>
are content with the gilded coronets
and fading chaplets of the world. You
remember the scene in the "Pilgrim&rsquo;s
Progress," part ii., which has been
made the subject of a painting by Sir
Noel Paton&mdash;the man raking straw
while one held a glittering crown over
his head. Make Christ your boast.
The crown of pride shall be hurled to
the ground, the garlanded revellers
shall sink in their own corruption,
the honours which men so eagerly
seek are as a fading flower, but the
crown shall sparkle for ever on the
believer&rsquo;s head (Dan. xii.&nbsp;3; Ps. xc.&nbsp;17).&mdash;<i>William Guthrie, M.A.</i></p>

<p class="gap" id="o241A">God has said He would discrown
Ephraim, remove his beauty, and strain
his pride. This was done when Samaria
was overthrown by the Assyrians.
&ldquo;In that day&rdquo; He would do to the
&ldquo;residue of His people&rdquo;&mdash;apparently
the kingdom of Judah&mdash;what is said
in our present text. It was done in
the reign of Hezekiah, when the true
worship was re-established, reformation
effected, and the nation defended
against its enemies.</p>

<p>The text may be regarded, however,
as a description of the splendour
of the regenerated world.</p>

<p>I. <span class="smcap">The persons interested.</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;The residue of His people: him
that sitteth in judgment: and them
that turn the battle to the gate.&rdquo; All
classes. Brave defenders; governors
and administrators of justice, and the
great mass of the people. Hence we
observe that the blessing of the Gospel
is needed by and suited to every class
and every man. If there be a man
anywhere who does not need it, it is
either because&mdash;(1),&nbsp;he has no soul to
save; or (2),&nbsp;he has not sinned; or
(3),&nbsp;he is sufficient in himself to remove sin
and its consequences from himself. But
none of these can be said of any man.</p>

<p>II. <span class="smcap">The blessing promised.</span></p>

<p>It consists in that which the Lord
will be to the regenerated world.
1.&nbsp;<i>Honour.</i> Men mistake the things that
constitute the true honour and dignity
of human nature. Sounding titles;
enormous wealth; personal beauty;
commanding intellect; undisputed
power. They are all insufficient and
insecure, like fading flowers. God is
the true crown of glory to man. When
the soul returns from its wanderings
to God and is re-united to Him through
Christ, the crown is placed upon his
head (Jer. ix.&nbsp;23, 24). 2.&nbsp;<i>Wisdom.</i>
Both in barbarous and civilised countries,
man without the Gospel is
ignorant of the character of God, and
of the way to approach Him (1&nbsp;Cor. i.&nbsp;21).
He gropes about in the darkness,
if he desire to find Him at all. But
Christ is made of God to us &ldquo;wisdom,&rdquo;
as well as &ldquo;righteousness, sanctification,
and redemption.&rdquo; In Him the
Divine character is closely seen in the
fulness, harmony, and glory of its
attributes. In Him also we learn how
man can be reconciled to God, and the
way to eternal life. 3.&nbsp;<i>Strength.</i> Not
physical, nor intellectual power, however
valuable in the regions proper to
them. But moral power; the power
of the human will; the most important
power of all. This alone possesses the
terrible capacity of resisting the Almighty.
The most powerful animals
act as they have been created to act.
All mechanical forces act according to
their laws. But man, possessed of
will, is possessed of a power that can
either defy or obey the authority of
Omnipotence. When the Gospel
comes to the human heart, it constrains
the will into a mighty force for
good. God and man combine to overthrow
the empire of evil in the heart
and in the world. &ldquo;The Lord of hosts
is for strength to them that turn the
battle to the gate.&rdquo;</p>

<p>III. <span class="smcap">The time indicated.</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;In that day.&rdquo; Christ came &ldquo;in
the fulness of time.&rdquo; There are reasons
and circumstances specially favourable
to the advancement of the kingdom of
Christ. There is a time in the purpose
of Jehovah when all nations shall
walk in the light. We may mark the
circumstances which are usually
indicative of the further spread of the
Gospel. 1.&nbsp;When there is a time
of special revival, reformation, and
earnestness in the Church. As in time
<span class="pagenum" id="p298">[p.&nbsp;298]</span>
of Hezekiah. 2.&nbsp;When God stirs up
His people to exert themselves for the
world&rsquo;s salvation, it is a sign that the
world&rsquo;s salvation is coming on apace.
&ldquo;When God enters the chamber, and
awakens His children, and bids them
rise, it is a sign that the morning has
come.&rdquo; 3.&nbsp;When the church longs,
waits, prays for the success of the
work, the time is likely to have come.
&ldquo;As soon as Zion travailed she brought
forth her children.&rdquo; Let the Church
of Christ really desire, believe in, pray
for the world&rsquo;s conversion, and God
will open the windows of heaven and
pour down the blessing. Have you
been sufficiently interested in the
world&rsquo;s salvation? As individuals?
Are we sufficiently interested in our
own?&mdash;<i>J. Rawlinson.</i></p>

<p class="tdc">(<i>Sunday School Anniversary Sermon.</i>)</p>

<p class="bq">xxviii.&nbsp;9, 10. <i>Whom shall He teach knowledge? &amp;c.</i></p>

<p>Whether we regard these verses as
the language of the drunkards of
Ephraim, deriding the Lord&rsquo;s messengers
for the plainness and urgency
of their unwelcome instructions, or as
the language of the prophet himself
affirming interrogatively the spiritual
ignorance and imbecility of the people,
with their prophets and priests, they
suggest the importance of earnestly
instructing the young in the knowledge
of our relations to God and eternity.
We may turn to them more hopefully
than to the old. Youth is the time
for learning. In the first ten years of
life are laid the foundations of the
social and religious character which
every man carries to the grave.
Therefore we should not leave them
to be laid haphazard, but should do
our utmost to bring it to pass that
they shall be such that on them can be
built the structure of a holy life. To
accomplish this we must instruct them
in the revealed will of God. 1.&nbsp;The
youth learns nothing good until he is
taught. Though wise to do evil, to
do good he has no knowledge. 2.&nbsp;The
young mind is susceptible of deep and
enduring impressions (H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I., 775,
776, 786). 3.&nbsp;Scriptural knowledge
is not only of surpassing value, but is
more easily imparted to the young
than most of that human knowledge
for which the opening powers are often
severely taxed. If difficulties arise
from immaturity and levity of mind,
they are more than balanced by freedom
from the prejudices of age, and
the perplexing cares of life; by their
docility and instinctive desire to penetrate
the unknown; by the eagerness
with which they seize upon the explanations
of facts in nature and providence,
or on similitudes and allegories;
and by their unsuspecting
confidence in the ability of their appointed
teachers. Their natural aversion
to God is but partially developed,
and waits the coming of riper years to
mature its strong resistance to the
Divine claims. 4.&nbsp;The weightiest
obligations rest on parents to give
their children religious instruction (H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I.,
803&ndash;806). When parents are
unable to do so personally, through
defect of ability, or the urgency of
paramount duties, it is their privilege
to do so through the kind offices of
others. 5.&nbsp;A failure in the discharge
of parental obligations to children
imposes on others who fear God the
duty of teaching the knowledge.
They are immortal; for them Christ
died. Of the fulness and glory of the
results of a faithful performance of
this duty no adequate conception can
be formed by us on this side of heaven.&mdash;<i>R.&nbsp;S. Storrs, D.D.,

<p>The application of this text is first
of all to the impressions produced by
the Word of God and the efficacy of
constant religious instruction. But it
is in this same way, by little and little,
that all great and lasting impressions
are made and the mightiest results
accomplished.</p>

<p><b>I. The processes of nature.</b>&mdash;Mighty
and sudden changes are not the rule,
but gradual and prepared ones. The
seasons, the months, day into night,
night into day&mdash;how gradual and imperceptible
the transitions. The germination
of seed, &amp;c. <b>II.&nbsp;The formation
of character.</b>&mdash;Little by little every
man&rsquo;s character is <i>formed</i> (H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I.,
709&ndash;711, 1836&ndash;1851) or <i>spoiled</i> (H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I.,
4521&ndash;4523, 4720&ndash;4725). All the
steps, successively, that lead either to
heaven or hell are small, one by one,
except in great crimes, and even then
there has been a gradual preparation
for them (H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I., 428, 429). So conversion,
that great change of the soul,
is prepared for imperceptibly (H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I.,
1462). From minute and commonplace
thoughts, words, actions, results
character for eternity! <b>III.&nbsp;Christian
service.</b>&mdash;Called not to acts of heroism,
but to a faithful discharge of
commonplace duties (H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I., 4149).
<b>IV.&nbsp;Christian work.</b>&mdash;It is by little
and little that, in such a world as
this, we must do the greater part of
the good that we ever accomplish (H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I.,
1725). <b>V.&nbsp;The training of children.</b>&mdash;Heavenly
habits are to be formed
in them by the influence upon them
of daily, familiar, minute, but ever-recurring
examples set before them
(H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I., 777&ndash;779, 790, 802). <b>VI.&nbsp;Preparation
for heaven.</b>&mdash;Try to gain a
little for God, a little for heaven, a
little more of grace <i>every</i> day. Do
this in <i>little</i> things and you will accomplish
<i>great</i> things. Here a little
and there a little will carry you on
from step to step, from grace to glory

1&nbsp;Pet. ii.&nbsp;4&ndash;8.</p>

<p><b>I. The grand object which God proposed
to Himself in all His dispensations
to man,</b> viz., the laying of a
foundation in which the hope of a
repenting sinner might rest, with regard
to God and Eternity. We trace
this object, 1.&nbsp;In the primal promise
(Gen. iii.&nbsp;15). 2.&nbsp;In the mysterious
rite of sacrifice Divinely appointed
from the beginning to prefigure &ldquo;the
Lamb of God who taketh away the
sins of the world.&rdquo; 3.&nbsp;In the whole
system of the Mosaic law, "The schoolmaster
<span class="pagenum" id="p300">[p.&nbsp;300]</span>
to bring us to Christ."
4.&nbsp;More and more distinctly announced
in the Psalms and Prophecies. The
foundation proclaimed by Jehovah in
the text is the chief end of all He has
done and revealed to mankind; the
central point in which all the lines of
His providence and His word meet
and terminate. Nature supplies the
scene, providence the scaffolding, revelation
the plan, and that mighty
spiritual edifice of which this is the
foundation.</p>

<p><b>II. This foundation was needed.</b>
None will dispute this point. So
sensible are men that they need a
foundation for hope towards God, that
every one is disposed to lay his own.
Every one feels that without some
restitution made to a holy God sin
cannot be pardoned nor the sinner
saved. The question is, How shall
a proper foundation be laid? where
shall an adequate restitution be found?
The most important question in
the universe to be answered and at
the same time the most difficult! (1&nbsp;Sam.
ii.&nbsp;25). Only three kinds of
restitution on the part of man are imaginable&mdash;penitence,
good works, voluntary
sufferings; but none of these,
nor all put together, can be deemed
satisfactory in the case before us.
1.&nbsp;<i>Penitence</i> is no foundation of the soul
before God; the most sorrowful remembrance
of sin cannot repair it (H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I.,
4225&ndash;4228). 2.&nbsp;Neither are
<i>good works,</i> to which the same insufficiency
attaches; they are always required,
and therefore can never possess
a superfluity or redundancy of
merit (H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I., 375, 1950). And this
applies to the best works; but what
are ours in the sight of God? 3.&nbsp;The
only remaining kind of restitution is
by <i>voluntary sufferings:</i> this, by its very
definition, is absurd and vain, for if
any sufferings are required they become
part of our duty; but to invent
penances of our own is no part of our
duty, and must be contradictory rather
than satisfactory to the Divine law.
Penitence, good works, voluntary sufferings,
may be methods of procuring
for us the priestly absolution of a poor
sinful man like ourselves; but they
will not secure for us the Divine acceptance.</p>

<p>III. Observe, it is in the midst of
the false foundations, the &ldquo;baseless
fabrics&rdquo; of sinners, that God in our
text introduces His own, <b>the only
true and solid foundation.</b> All who
build their hope on any other will be
compelled at last to say, &ldquo;We have
made lies our refuge, and under falsehood
we have hid ourselves.&rdquo; See
1&nbsp;Cor. iii.&nbsp;10. The wonderful way in
which this stone was laid; how a
person of the Godhead assumed our
human nature, He who was in the
form of God took the form of a servant,
He became &ldquo;Jehovah our righteousness.&rdquo;
See 2&nbsp;Cor. v.&nbsp;19. He who
laid the foundation of the heavens and
the earth alone could lay this foundation
in Zion!</p>

<p><b>VI. The excellent qualities of this
foundation.</b> It is represented&mdash;1.&nbsp;As
<i>&ldquo;a tried stone:&rdquo;</i> a foundation which has
resisted the strongest attempts to
shake it,&mdash;that has stood the trial of
unnumbered enemies and friends. It
has been proved in the fiery trial of
Divine justice, and the sins of the
whole world have tried its strength
to sustain an overwhelming weight.
The storms of persecution have raged
against it in vain, still it stands uninjured
(Heb. xiii.&nbsp;8)! In every respect
&ldquo;a tried stone;&rdquo; tried by God,
by Satan, by man; tried in life, in
death, in eternity; tried by all the
saints in all their trials; and never
tried in vain! 2.&nbsp;As <i>&ldquo;a corner-stone.&rdquo;</i>
The corner-stone unites both sides of
an edifice; and St. Paul represents
Christ as Him in whom the whole
building, fitly compacted, rises a
spiritual habitation of God (Eph. ii.&nbsp;19&ndash;22).
3.&nbsp;As <i>&ldquo;precious;&rdquo;</i> precious
in respect to the Saviour&rsquo;s Person as
the only begotten Son of God; in
respect to His sacrifice; a foundation
composed not of corruptible things
(1&nbsp;Peter i.&nbsp;18, 19). 4.&nbsp;As <i>&ldquo;a sure
foundation:&rdquo;</i> not an imaginary one
like every other, but one real and
substantial! In the Hebrew the
word is reduplicated for the greater
<span class="pagenum" id="p301">[p.&nbsp;301]</span>
emphasis, &ldquo;A foundation, a foundation!&rdquo;
Not a transitory but an
eternal one. We are dying men; we
sojourn in a world of vanity and
death; what we want is a &ldquo;sure
foundation.&rdquo; Behold in Christ this
grand desideratum!</p>

<p><b>V. The happiness of him who rests
on this foundation.</b> &ldquo;He that believeth
shall not make haste;&rdquo; he shall not
be thrown into disquietude and agitation
of spirit. Never has the strength
of this foundation been so well appreciated
as when it was most tried, most
needed. When our flesh and our heart
fail, then is the time to find in God
the rock of our heart, in Christ the
foundation of our soul!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Conclusion.</span>&mdash;But then we must
possess the character defined in the
text; &ldquo;he that believeth,&rdquo; is he that
amidst the wreck of nature shall be
saved on this foundation. We must
see to it that we have that faith which
is known by its fruits, which keeps
the commandments, purifies the heart,
works by love, overcomes the world,
resists the devil, rejoices in Christ.&mdash;<i>Robert Hall:
Fifty Sermons,</i> pp 68&ndash;86.</p>

<p class="gap" id="o244C"><b>I. God&rsquo;s foundation for the stability of
His Church.</b> 1.&nbsp;<i>This foundation was
planned in the eternal counsels of Jehovah</i>
(1&nbsp;Pet. i.&nbsp;20; Luke xi.&nbsp;50; Rev.

laid in the incarnation and sufferings of
Jesus Christ</i> (2&nbsp;Cor. v.&nbsp;21; Gal. iii.&nbsp;13;

3.&nbsp;A <i>tried stone.</i> The Father tried it,

generally placed for three purposes
for (<i>a.</i>)&nbsp;union; for (<i>b.</i>)&nbsp;beauty; for

<p class="gap" id="o244D">Whatever subordinate reference
there may be in these words to the
Jews, the principle reference is to the
Messiah. For this view we have apostolic
authority. St. Paul says: &ldquo;As
it is written.&rdquo; Where? In our
text. &ldquo;Whosoever believeth in Him
shall not be ashamed.&rdquo; And St.
Peter quotes from Isaiah the same
text.</p>

<p><b>I. The Emblem of the Lord
Jesus.</b> &ldquo;A stone.&rdquo; Whether we
consider Him &ldquo;a stone&rdquo; for solidity,
or for strength, or for duration, He is
all these; for whatever changes may
take place among men, with Him
&ldquo;there is no variableness nor shadow
of turning.&rdquo; Peter calls Him&mdash;1.&nbsp;A
&ldquo;living stone,&rdquo; meaning that He has
life in Himself, that He procures and
dispenses it to others. So Paul (Col.
iii.&nbsp;4). 2.&nbsp;He is a <i>tried stone.</i> Everything
in regard to Him was tried in
the days of His flesh: His wisdom,
His meekness, His love. 3.&nbsp;He is a
<i>precious stone.</i> Precious to God the
Father, to angels, to Christians (1&nbsp;Pet.
ii.&nbsp;7). 4.&nbsp;A precious <i>corner-stone.</i>
The corner-stone stands to unite. He
unites in His person deity and manhood.
We see in Him united the Old
and New Testament dispensations.
He unites Jews and Gentiles (Eph. ii.&nbsp;14).</p>

<p><b>II. His destination.</b> &ldquo;Behold I lay

was a Jew, of the family of David.

<p class="gap" id="o244E"><b>I. The prominent idea of the text.</b>
Christ a foundation-stone. 1.&nbsp;The
<i>Builder</i> is Jehovah Himself. He drew
the plan of the spiritual building, determined
the materials of which it
should be constructed, the stone on
which it should rest, and then with
His own hand laid that foundation.
2.&nbsp;The <i>Site</i> of the building was &ldquo;Zion.&rdquo;
This is generally explained as referring
to the Church. But is not the Church
the building? Is there not an incongruity
in saying, I lay in the Church
a foundation-stone on which the Church
is to be built? Is there any reason
why the passage might not be understood
literally as referring to Jerusalem?
Is there not a very appropriate
sense in which it was true that the
foundation on which the Church rests
was laid in Jerusalem? Was it not
there that the Son of God offered up
Himself as a sacrifice, and made atonement
for man? Was it not there that
the Holy Spirit descended and gave
effect to the finished work of redemption?
Was it not there the gospel
was first preached by the apostles?
And was not all this in accordance
with the pre-arrangements of God&rsquo;s
plan? As Zechariah&rsquo;s fountain was
to be opened to the house of David
and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and
as Ezekiel&rsquo;s waters were to flow forth
from the temple, so Isaiah&rsquo;s foundation-stone
was laid in Jerusalem. 3.&nbsp;The
<i>building</i> to be reared on this stone was
to be composed of Christian men of all
ages and all nations. They are being
collected now; they will all as lively
stones by gathered in, fitly framed
together, and built upon the foundation
of the apostles and prophets,
Jesus Christ Himself being the chief
corner-stone.</p>

<p><b>II. The qualities attributed to this
foundation-stone.</b> 1.&nbsp;A <i>tried</i> stone.
2.&nbsp;A <i>precious</i> corner-stone. How shall
we estimate its worth? By its intrinsic
value? Precious beyond all price.
By its scarceness? No other stone
like it in the universe. By the importance
of the service it renders in
the building? Precious to the Builder,
to the holy angels, to the redeemed
before the throne, to believers on
earth. 3.&nbsp;A <i>sure</i> foundation. Firm,
solid, safe.</p>

<p><b>III. The import of the promise</b>
<span class="wsnw"><b>annexed.</b><a id="o244_fna2" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#o244_fn2">[2]</a></span>
1.&nbsp;Shall not make haste,
or be in haste. 2.&nbsp;Shall not be put
to shame (Rom. ix.&nbsp;33, x.&nbsp;11, &amp;c.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Conclusion.</span>&mdash;If not on the foundation,
get on it. If on it, keep on it.
Be not content to build on it yourself,
but try to induce others to do so.&mdash;<i>John Corbin.</i></p>

<p class="gap" id="o244F"><b>I. Sinful, dying man needs a foundation
on which he may securely rest his
immortal hopes.</b> Every man who
studies his own nature and destiny as
immortal and accountable instinctively
feels that he needs something to give
him support under the trials of life,
and peace and hope as he is about to
enter upon the invisible world. This
feeling may exert no decisive influence
over his conduct; it may be counteracted
by other influences; but it is in
him; and he cannot get rid of it.</p>

<p><b>II. Such a foundation is laid for him
in Zion.</b> This foundation is our Lord
Jesus Christ (1&nbsp;Pet. ii.&nbsp;4&ndash;6). It is
described 1.&nbsp;as <i>a stone,</i> indicating the
solidity and durableness of that on
which we are invited to rest our immortal
<span class="pagenum" id="p303">[p.&nbsp;303]</span>
interests. In rearing a building
of any importance, we deem it essential
that the foundation be laid in the
most enduring materials. How much
more should we look for this when we
build for eternity! 2.&nbsp;As <i>a tried stone.</i>
It has been tested in every possible
way, and in the severest manner, and
therefore justly claims our full and
unhesitating
<span class="wsnw">confidence.<a id="o244_fna3" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#o244_fn3">[3]</a></span>
Other grounds of hope have been resorted to
by men&mdash;philosophy, infidelity, self-righteousness&mdash;but
they have always
failed in the day of trial. But a countless
multitude, as they have risen from
earth to heaven, have testified to the
perfect safety of trusting in Christ.
Hence it is called 3.&nbsp;<i>a precious stone.</i>
How precious none can know but such
as have made trial of it in their times
of need&mdash;the sinner, burdened with a
sense of guilt, and sinking in despair;
the believer, rejoicing in hope, and
looking forward to heaven as his eternal
home; the dying Christian, as he
closes his eyes on this world, in joyful
hope of another and a better; the
redeemed in glory, as they cast their
crowns at His feet. Ask them what
they think of Christ. 4.&nbsp;As <i>a corner-stone.</i>
The principal weight of an
edifice rests on the corners; and hence,
in building, the largest and firmest
blocks are selected and placed there
as best adapted to unite and support
the whole structure. This is the idea
intended to be expressed when Christ
is spoken of as a corner-stone. It is
He who, by His truth, His grace, and
His spirit, converts and sustains the
whole living temple (Eph. ii.&nbsp;20&ndash;22).
5.&nbsp;As summing up the whole&mdash;<i>a sure
foundation.</i> Hence it is said, &ldquo;He that
believeth shall not make
<span class="wsnw">haste.&rdquo;<a id="o244_fna4" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#o244_fn4">[4]</a></span>
The specific idea is that of a man on
whose house the tempest beats, and
who apprehends that the foundation
is insecure, or feels it to be giving way
beneath him, and therefore makes
haste to flee from his dwelling to seek
a more safe position. The foundation
laid in Zion is so firm and secure that
if a man trusts himself on it, he shall
have no cause of alarm, however the
storms may beat, and the waves dash
and foam around him. Amid the
wreck of matter and the crash of dissolving
worlds, he shall not be confounded,
but shall come forth at last
unharmed and victorious over all, and
find in his Judge a friend, and in the
kingdom of His Father and God an
everlasting home.</p>

<p><b>III. It is the duty and privilege of
all to build their hopes on this foundation
without delay.</b></p>

<i>&ldquo;He that buildeth shall not make haste.&rdquo;</i>
The apostles Paul and Peter, in citing this
passage, quote from the Septuagint, and accordingly
they render it <i>&ldquo;he that believeth
shall not be ashamed&rdquo;</i> (Rom. ix.&nbsp;33), or &ldquo;confounded&rdquo;
(1&nbsp;Pet. ii.&nbsp;6). The Hebrew word
properly signified &ldquo;to make haste,&rdquo; and hence,
according to one lexicographer, &ldquo;to hurry
hither and thither as persons in confusion.&rdquo;
The apparent discrepancy between the text
as given by Isaiah in the Old Testament and
as quoted by the apostles in the New vanishes
at once when we consider the nature of the
future employed. Conceive the situation of a
man who has &ldquo;built his house upon the sand.&rdquo;
The rains descend, the floods beat upon that
house, the foundations begin to give way,
the house totters to its fall, and the frightened
inmate, terrified and bewildered, &ldquo;makes
haste&rdquo; to escape to a place of safety. Another
has built his house upon the rock. Upon
this also the rains descend and the floods
beat, but its firm foundations remain unmoved
because it is founded upon a rock, and
its happy inmate, so far from being obliged
to &ldquo;make haste&rdquo; to escape, in conscious
security may smile at the storm. &ldquo;He that
believeth shall not make haste&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;shall not
be confounded&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;shall not be ashamed&rdquo; of
his hope.&mdash;<i>John Dowling, D.D.</i></p></div>

translations by Alexander and Delitzsch. Kay

text reading does not suit the connection; it
seems to have arisen out of a confusion of the
letters mem and kheth. Sept., Tay., Pesh.,
feeling that something was wrong, render
freely &ldquo;Shall not be put to shame?&rdquo; But as

<p class="bq">xxviii.&nbsp;16. <i>A tried stone.</i></p>

<p>This phrase may be more literally
rendered &ldquo;a stone for proof,&rdquo; and so
rendered admits of two interpretations.
The commonly received opinion,
that it means a stone which has been
tried and found sufficient is probably
correct, and is more in harmony with
the context; but Calvin understands
by it a stone which was to be the test
or standard of comparison for others.
However this may be, we have inspired
authority for saying that the stone is
no other than our Lord Jesus Christ
(1&nbsp;Pet. ii.&nbsp;6); and we may profitably
consider Him in these two aspects, as
our Trust and our Test.</p>

<p>I. <span class="smcap">He is our Trust,</span> because He
has been tried. &ldquo;Tried in the days
of His humanity by all the vehemence
of temptations, and the weight of afflictions,
yet, like gold from the furnace,
rendered more shining and illustrious
by the fiery scrutiny.&ldquo;&mdash;(<i>Hervey.</i>)
[For further amplifications, see the
other outlines on this text.&mdash;R.A.B.]</p>

<p>II. <span class="smcap">He is our Test.</span> In Him we
have the true touchstone of character.
All men naturally divide themselves
into good or bad, saved or lost, by
their acceptance or rejection of Him.
By this touch-stone strange discoveries
have been made in every age. The
Pharisees and Scribes had a high
character for piety until this trying
stone was applied to them, and then
it appeared what they were&mdash;the most
inveterate enemies of God on earth.
The reception which men gave to
Jesus Christ is the great criterion of
their character, as Simeon predicted
(Luke ii.&nbsp;34). This is the supreme
test by which God is trying <i>you,</i> and
by which your eternal destiny will be
determined.&mdash;<i>Samuel Davies, A.M.,

<p class="bq">xxviii.&nbsp;16. <i>A tried stone.</i></p>

<p>This is perhaps an allusion to the
custom of builders who are about to
lay the foundation for some massive
structure. Before they raise the edifice
they test the character of the substratum
on which they think of building.
Is not our blessed Lord in every
way a tried, a tested, an approved
Saviour! I.&nbsp;<i>Did not the Father try
Him</i> and find Him faithful in every
way?&mdash;in His willingness, His obedience,
His love? II.&nbsp;<i>Did not Satan try
Him</i> and find Him upright? Tried
by temptations addressed to His natural
appetite, to pride, and to ambition.
III.&nbsp;<i>Was He not tried by wicked
and unbelieving men?</i> By Pharisees,
Sadducees, and Herodians in His
own day, and by sceptics in ours.
IV.&nbsp;<i>By the afflicted, the poor, the
destitute</i> in His own day and in ours?
and in each case only to bring out
more clearly the marvellousness
of His resources. V.&nbsp;<i>By the contrite
and broken-hearted?</i> VI.&nbsp;<i>By believers
in every generation?</i> And what
has been their unanimous testimony?
Is it not that they found Him more
than equal to all their wants and
able to do for them all that they
could ask or think? Could so many
millions of witnesses, in other respects
trustworthy, be mistaken on this
point? VII.&nbsp;<span class="smcap">Have you tried him?</span>&mdash;<i>R. Bingham, M.A.:

<h3 class="tdc" id="o247"><span class="smcap">False Refuges.</span></h3>

<p class="bq">xxviii.&nbsp;17. <i>And the hail shall sweep away the refuge of lies.</i></p>

<p>Numerous are the stratagems of
Satan to ruin souls. In some he
effects this by hurrying them on in
the broad way of open transgression;
in others, by rendering them the victims
of some peculiar constitutional
sin&mdash;pride, avarice, &amp;c.; in others, by
inciting a spirit of disbelief of the
truth (Ps. xiv.&nbsp;1); in others, by inducing
inattention to the things of the
soul. But our text leads us to contemplate
<i>the false refuges to which he
causes others to betake themselves.</i></p>

<p><b>I. Sinners often feel the necessity
of a refuge.</b> This arises sometimes
from&mdash;1.&nbsp;<i>An internal sense of guilt.</i>
Unless in cases of utter obduracy,
transgression and remorse are ever
wedded together. Even pagans have
these pangs of guilty torture. Under
these, men sigh for peace, long for
rest, and earnestly desire a refuge.
2.&nbsp;<i>The calamitous events of life.</i> Sudden
adversity, domestic bereavement, visiting
the open grave of some friend,
bodily indisposition, mental disquietude,
&amp;c. 3.&nbsp;<i>The supposed nearness
of death.</i> Men who mock at religion
in health, quail at the approach of
death. Voltaire trembled in a storm,
anxious then to have deliverance, to
obtain a refuge. 4.&nbsp;<i>Under the alarming
influence of the preached word.</i> When
the truth has flashed across the mind
and startled the conscience. Thus
Felix, and thus thousands. How
lamentable that these impressions and
convictions are often so fleeting; but
still more so, when the convicted sinner
flees to sources of false security.</p>

<p><b>II. Sinners frequently betake themselves
to refuges of lies.</b> Of these
notice&mdash;1.&nbsp;<i>Partial reformation of life.</i>
Giving up the grosser sins of which
they have been guilty, intemperance,
profanity, fraud, &amp;c. When the whole
body is diseased, the amputation of
one member is fruitless. 2.&nbsp;<i>A general
regard to Christian morality,</i> to the outward
acts of obedience, and the decencies
of society. 3.&nbsp;<i>An outward
profession of religion.</i> Punctual regard
to public worship, a proper regard to
ordinances, a name among the people
of God. 4.&nbsp;<i>A prominent and public
sectarian spirit.</i> Rigid adherence to
party, sect, and creed; violent anathematising
all others; great ardour in
the public events of the Church to
which they belong. &ldquo;Come, see my
zeal,&rdquo; &amp;c. 5.&nbsp;<i>Distinguished generosity.</i>
Liberality to the poor, works of beneficence,
co-operation with the compassionate
and benevolent. All these
things are good in their legitimate
sphere and extent, but they are all
often only refuges of lies; they
may engage a man&rsquo;s anxious attention,
while the root of the matter
has yet no place in his heart (1&nbsp;Cor.
xiii.&nbsp;1&ndash;3; Matt. vii.&nbsp;22, 23). 6.&nbsp;A
still more commonly frequent refuge
of lies: <i>a general reliance on the mercy
of God.</i> A kind of self-confident persuasion
that God is good, that He will
not punish, an indefinite resting on
His clemency, forgetting His righteousness,
purity, truth, &amp;c.</p>

<p><b>III. Such refuges of lies will be
ultimately swept away.</b> They will be
so&mdash;1.&nbsp;<i>In a dying hour.</i> Then the
mental vision often becomes peculiarly
acute, the moral sense keen and distinct,
and the honesty of the spirit
throws off the tinsel mask, which is
now manifestly worse than useless.
How poor and worthless is self-righteousness,
in all its possible extent,
to a spirit just stepping into the presence
of the holy God. A queen of
England, although professing to be
&ldquo;Defender of the Faith,&rdquo; and having
bishops at her control, felt this, and
died in circumstances of unutterable
alarm. 2.&nbsp;<i>In the morning of the resurrection.</i>
Then all classes and distinctions
will be reduced to two. None
but the righteous will have a part in
the first resurrection. Others will rise
with shame, confusion, and horror to
everlasting contempt. 3.&nbsp;<i>In the decisions</i>
<span class="pagenum" id="p306">[p.&nbsp;306]</span>
<i>of the judgment.</i> God will judge
all men in righteousness. The wicked
and the righteous will be separated
(Matt. xxv.&nbsp;32, 33); no pretence, disguise,
plea, stratagem, importunity, or
effort, will avail. All refuges of lies
will be swept away.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Application.</span>&mdash;1.&nbsp;Warn against
these destructive schemes and wiles
of Satan. 2.&nbsp;Exhibit the one only
refuge, Jesus Christ, who delivers
from the wrath to come. 3.&nbsp;Urge
instant faith in Him. &ldquo;Count all
things but loss,&rdquo; &amp;c. All who believe
in Him are secure for both worlds. To
this Refuge let <i>all</i> repair, earnestly,
and now.&mdash;<i>Jabez Burns, D.D.: Pulpit
Cyclop&aelig;dia,</i> iii. 153&ndash;156.</p>

<h3 class="tdc" id="o248"><span class="smcap">The Short Bed and the Narrow Covering.</span></h3>

<p class="bq">xxviii.&nbsp;20. <i>For the bed is shorter, &amp;c.</i></p>

<p>Of all the striking images made use
of in this chapter, none was so likely
to catch the ear, and impress itself on
the memory, and become a seed of
useful reflection, as that embodied in
this proverbial saying. Epigrams have
done much to guide popular movements.
Lord Bacon speaks of them
as &ldquo;the edge-tools which cut and
penetrate the knots of business and
affairs.&rdquo; The adage before us is homely,
but forcible and expressive. To a fastidious
taste and a false refinement it
may appear undignified; but where one
has to deal with reckless folly and obstinacy,
he selects what best serves
his purpose of exposing it. Lifted out
of the occasions which gave the birth,
these pithy and sententious sayings admit
of manifold applications. They
refute error, and make truth visible.</p>

<p>I. Apply this aphorism to the <i>shifts
of diplomacy.</i> This is the use which
the prophet makes of it. No words
could better expose the folly of the
Egyptian alliance. The &ldquo;scornful&rdquo;
politicians of Jerusalem &ldquo;had not only
secured themselves by a treaty with
that personification of death and hell,
the Assyrian, but they had outwitted
him; for what chance could a mere
barbarian soldier have against the
deep-laid policy of an old, long-civilised
state? They were in communication
with Egypt and Ethiopia, and at the
proper time would bring the armies of
Tirhakah to free them from the power of
Sennacherib.&rdquo; This was the plausible
but imprudent and deceitful scheme
which the prophet denounced; and all
such measures will in due time land
their short-sighted and dishonest authors
in the short bed with the narrow
covering.</p>

<p>II. Apply it to the <i>dishonesties of
trade</i> and the <i>reckless extravagance of
living.</i> The rash speculator and the
careless spendthrift will soon find out
its truth. If they do not live within
their means, and regulate dress and
diet according to their income, they
will soon find themselves in the short
bed, vainly seeking warmth and comfort
under a scanty covering. How
much society has suffered from reckless
speculation! Many a promising
youth has foolishly squandered his
means, and has grown so enormously
in his luxurious habits, that he has no
room to stretch himself on the short
bed of his income. Visions of sequestration
disturb his repose; pinching
poverty hinders his comfort.</p>

<p>III. The same imprudent miscalculation
is seen in <i>the plans of worldly-minded
men.</i> Their purpose is to make
a fortune, and then retire to enjoy it.
They imagine that thus they shall
have constructed an ample bed with
abundant covering, in which they may
comfortably spend the evening of life&rsquo;s
day. But they have made their bed
without measuring its occupant at his
full height. Providing for the body,
but neglecting the soul, they are cribbed
and confined within the narrow boundaries
of time, and it will be well for
them if they discover their mistake
when the chill frosts of old age seize
upon their uncovered limbs.</p>

<p>IV. Apply it to the <i>expedients by
which men seek spiritual rest.</i> There
<span class="pagenum" id="p307">[p.&nbsp;307]</span>
are many short beds on which they
seek repose, and narrow coverings in
which they try to wrap themselves.
What apologies do they find for their
sin!&mdash;how earnestly they work out a
righteousness of their own in which to
find shelter, forgetting that &ldquo;all have
sinned and come short,&rdquo; and &ldquo;the one
thing&rdquo; they lack is a fatal defect!
They will soon shiver with cold under
this insufficient covering. Nothing
but the saving work of Christ can
answer man&rsquo;s need as a sinful creature.
Here is both room and warmth (Matt.
xi.&nbsp;28). As the fond mother lays her
child to sleep, so will He provide for
our comfort (Isa. lxvi.&nbsp;13). The word
&ldquo;hap&rdquo; is dear to a Scotch ear, expressing
&ldquo;the care with which the bed-clothes
are laid upon the little forms,
and carefully tucked in about the
round sleeping cheeks.&rdquo; Seek rest in
Christ. He will support you in sickness
and sooth you in pain; and
when laid down on your last bed, rejoicing
in the fulness and all-sufficiency
of His grace, you will fall asleep in
Him. A common proverb runs, &ldquo;He
has made his bed, and now he must
lie on it,&rdquo; sometimes harshly used,
yet expressing a solemn truth (Gal.
vi.&nbsp;7; Isa. l.&nbsp;11).&mdash;<i>William Guthrie, M.A.</i></p>

<p class="gap" id="o248A">An end is proposed to be accomplished;
the first consideration will
be the suitability and sufficiency of
means. The kingdom of Judah was
trusting in inadequate defences against
the Assyrians, whose approach was
feared. False gods. Words of false prophets.
Alliance with Egypt. Warned
against all these. True defence in
faithful adherence to God as covenant
God. If they continued to look elsewhere
they would find themselves in
the position of a man in a bed too
short for him, or with a covering too
narrow to wrap himself. Instead of
comfort and rest, weariness, discomfort,
unrest. The bed does not answer
its end. It is inadequate.</p>

<p>This thought is capable of another
application. Men&rsquo;s religious beliefs
and practices may be inadequate. A
religion for man must be true in itself,
be evidenced as true, be adapted to
and sufficient for his religious necessities,
capacities, and susceptibilities.
Otherwise, it is inadequate.</p>

<p>Point out the inadequacy of some
religious ideas that are in vogue.</p>

<p><b>I. Scepticism is inadequate.</b> There
is not only the unbelief that denies
the truth of Christianity, but the
more subtle unbelief which refuses to
affirm while it does not exactly deny.
It says we know nothing, and may act
on the assumption that there is nothing&mdash;as
to God, Christ, a future
state. Now we might show that there
is sufficient evidence, but at present
only show that this theory is not adequate
to the demands of human nature.
It is a fair inference from the almost
universal experience of mankind that
the doctrines of God, conscience, responsibility,
prayer, a future state of
existence, are congenial to human nature.
Education does not account for
them, although it may give them
shape. Without them human nature
is short of something which it needs.
It is adapted to them. Without them
its deepest needs are inadequately supplied.</p>

<p>The religion of the Bible supplies
the need of man in all these respects.
It reveals the Divine Being and
character. It tells of a Father on
whom, in his helplessness, man may
call. It guides his conscience so that
it may fitly guide <i>him.</i> It acquaints
us with the nature of the life to come.</p>

<p><b>II. Self-righteousness is inadequate.</b>
There are necessities which did not
exist in man&rsquo;s original constitution,
self-created necessities. The state of
sinfulness is a second nature, superinduced
on the original nature. Overlooking
this, many imagine the Divine
favour can be won and the religious
life prosecuted by obedience to God
and kindness to man. They proceed on
the supposition that it is only necessary
to continue such a course from any
given commencement. If the sinful
part is recognised, it is assumed that
it will be condoned in consideration
of the new service. It is assumed
<span class="pagenum" id="p308">[p.&nbsp;308]</span>
that the long-standing debt of former
sin will be gradually paid by goodness
in excess of ordinary demands, or that
God, in some unknown way, will remit
it.</p>

<p>This bed is too short. This covering
too narrow. The religion for a
fallen creature must deal seriously
with the state of sin, guilt, condemnation.
The question meets you at
the outset. If every farthing of your
present income is absolutely required
to meet your barest necessities, how
can you out of it pay back debts?
Does not the law require a perfect
obedience? Do you at present render
more than it requires? Do you ever,
with your best endeavour, come up to
the law?</p>

<p>It is hopelessly inadequate. The
religion for man must provide a free
forgiveness; one also honourable to
God. It is not in our power. It is
in God. And He has made such a
provision. The Gospel of the Lord
Jesus Christ is that provision. His
obedience, death, righteousness. Freely
given without works to the believing
sinner. This is the only adequate
ground. This bed is long enough.
This covering wide enough.</p>

<p><b>III. Ceremonialism is inadequate.</b>
Human nature is impure. It needs
cleansing as well as pardon. Some
imagine this is accomplished by sacramental
grace, through baptism, which
is supposed to regenerate; and the
mysterious influence of the consecrated
bread and wine. All this is
inadequate. No outward rite can
effect an inward and spiritual change.
There must be a new nature. There
must be a love of holiness and a living
growth into holiness. There must be
a new birth. There must be the conviction
of sinfulness; the acceptance
of Christ; the surrender to the authority
of Christ. For this the Gospel
provision is adequate. There is the
word of God which proclaims the
mercy and offers the inducement.
There is the Holy Spirit which
changes the heart.</p>

<p>Be not satisfied with inadequate
religion. Remember the solemn importance
of possessing an adequate
religion.&mdash;<i>J. Rawlinson.</i></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 class="tdc" id="o249"><span class="smcap">Irreligious Mockery.</span></h3>

<p class="bq">xxviii.&nbsp;22. <i>Now, therefore, be ye not mockers, lest your bands be made strong.</i></p>

<p>The sense of the ludicrous is excited
by words, ideas, images, or objects in
which unexpected resemblances are
seen in things previously considered
incongruous, or in which incongruity
is perceived where complete resemblance
was supposed. The perception
of the ludicrous varies. Where it
exists in connection with the ability
to convey the ludicrous idea in
language, it is called wit. It is one
of God&rsquo;s gifts. There is no reason
why it should not be exercised. The
evil is in untimeliness and excess. It
is dispiriting and sad to be with
people who are always and only see the
dismal side of everything. It is
equally pitiable to observe people
who are ever in search of something
laughable. The latter is a present-day
danger. We have publications
whose aim is to present the ludicrous
side of everything. The popular taste
encourages such writing. Even grand
themes are not exempt for this kind
of treatment. Some mock deliberately
that they may injure; others thoughtlessly
for the amusement of the moment.
Of all wit it is the most
gratuitous the easiest, the most mischievous
and dangerous.</p>

<p>I. <span class="smcap">The objects by which it is
excited.</span></p>

<p>Religious persons; their peculiarities,
especially their foibles. Christian
ministers as to their style and manner.
In their impatience of the warnings
addressed to them by the prophet, the
people of Judah mocked his teaching
as characterised by the repetition that
is only suitable to children (9&ndash;13).
Some find food for mockery in the
<span class="pagenum" id="p309">[p.&nbsp;309]</span>
doctrines of the Gospel. Others in
the demand of holiness (Prov. xiv.&nbsp;9).
Others in the observances of worship.
Others find the language of Scripture
the most convenient point to their
jests.</p>

<p>II. <span class="smcap">The motives in which it
originates.</span></p>

<p>Many do it from mere inconsiderateness.
It is sometimes indulged in
from the wish to please. Mockery of
religious persons and things is so
palatable to many that there is great
temptation to it. More frequently it
originates in the rooted hostility of
the carnal mind against all earnest
religion. Mockery is the most annoying
form of attack; it is most keenly
felt; it is most difficult to answer. It
serves the purpose when argument
fails. One grinning Voltaire may do
more execution than many reasoning
Humes. Many a time since the days
of Nehemiah have Sanballat and his
Samaritans mocked the builders of
the wall of Jerusalem.</p>

<p>III. <span class="smcap">The dangers which it involves.</span></p>

<p>1. To those who hear it. They
become less susceptible of religious
impression. If the head of a family
habitually refer to religious persons
and subjects in a mocking and disrespectful
manner, his children will
probably grow up with a dislike of
religion.</p>

<p>2. To those who indulge in it.
They lose their own respect for religion,
if they had any, by associating
it with the ideas of a low and ludicrous
nature. They lose the elevating
mental influence of having their minds
in earnest contact with its grand
truths. They lose the spiritual improvement
which might have been
the result of such contact.</p>

<p>3. And the warning of the text
points to direct punishment. The
&ldquo;consumption determined.&rdquo; It points
to the bands of captivity which would
be more strong because of their unbelieving
mockery. The mocker is
preparing strong bands of distress for
his conscience, if the day should ever
come when he is awakened to a sense
of sin and an earnest desire for salvation.
How bitterly will he repent
the injury his levities did to his own
mind and the mind of others. Still
more saddening is the thought that
the mocker is likely so to harden his
heart into insensibility to serious impression,
that even on the bed of
death, and with the solemnities of
eternity before him, it will be impossible
to awaken serious concern.</p>

<p>Follow the mocking soul to the bar
of God where it must answer for its
mockeries, and for all the state of
mind which rendered it possible to
mock. <b>There will be no mockery in
hell!</b></p>

<p>Do not brave these bands. Young
men, do not sit in the seat of the
scorner. Do not be among the
mockers. Let the mocker hear the
solemn warning of the text, and repent
and seek mercy through the
cross, and relinquish his folly.&mdash;<i>J. Rawlinson.</i></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 class="tdc" id="o250"><span class="smcap">The Parable of the Husbandman.</span></h3>

<p class="bq">xxviii.&nbsp;24, 25. <i>Doth the ploughman plough all day to sow?</i>
<span class="wsnw"><i>&amp;c.</i><a id="o250_fna1" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#o250_fn1">[1]</a></span></p>

<p>Means adapted to the end must be
used if any end is to be accomplished.
The physician knows this. So does
the general. So does the manufacturer.
So does the farmer. He is not always
ploughing. Nor always sowing. Nor
always threshing. Nor does he treat
every kind of produce in the same way.
And God employs various methods in
dealing with men. He aims to turn
them from evil, and He adapts His
methods. The teaching of the text
may be applied to the Divine dealing
with men generally.</p>

<p><b>I. God intended to open a way of
salvation.</b> Man needs salvation because
he is a sinner. Can conceive a
state of things in which he would not
need it, as of one who needs no physician.
If he had continued holy and
obedient. But that is not his case.
He is a sinner, characterised by impurity,
<span class="pagenum" id="p310">[p.&nbsp;310]</span>
and exposed to perdition.&mdash;Now
God, in His pitying love, would
save us. How shall He proceed?
Shall He, by His arbitrary will, sweep
away the facts? Such a procedure
would be entirely inconsistent with
the existence of moral government and
the rectitude of the Divine character.
1.&nbsp;One part of the case to be dealt
with was the condemned state of man
under the Divine law. Forgiveness
could not righteously be given without
some satisfaction. Man could not
make it. God in Christ, in His whole
personality and work, has made the
satisfaction. The method adopted is
exactly adapted to the nature of the
case. 2.&nbsp;But the other part of the
case was also to be dealt with. Sinfulness
is deep-seated in man&rsquo;s nature.
He loves it. Until he is changed, he
is not even inclined to sue for mercy,
still less to escape from sin. The Lord
Jesus Christ was sent to turn us from
our iniquities. How does He do this?
(1.)&nbsp;<i>By moral motive.</i> The law was
inadequate. He introduces a new
motive. Not only the mercy, but the
fact that it has been procured at such
a cost, that the love was equal to such
a sacrifice. It appeals directly to the
heart, as well as to the judgment, for
a condemnation of sin. (2.)&nbsp;<i>By spiritual
influence.</i> The influence of the
Holy Spirit strives with those to whom
the gospel is preached, with a view
to the overcoming their indifference,
reluctance, and sin.&mdash;The method is
adapted, in both its sides, to the end
in view. It only requires the sinner&rsquo;s
consent. Hence&mdash;</p>

<p><b>II. God intended the way of salvation
to be made known to men.</b> If
consent to it and faith in it is requisite
to participation of its blessings, it
must be understood&mdash;1.&nbsp;The information
might have been imparted in a
separate revelation by the Holy Spirit
to every man. Would supersede all
evidence, and all exercise of human
faculty. Would not be adapted to
man as a reasonable being. 2.&nbsp;Angelic
ministry might have been employed.
Open to similar objection. Would
have made miracle the rule instead of
the exception. It would have changed
the order of nature. 3.&nbsp;The method
adopted is the simple arrangement
that those who are acquainted with it,
believe it, consent to it, make the
Gospel known. A method exactly
adopted to the nature of the case.
According to the constitution of human
nature, the Gospel thus approaches it
for the purpose of gaining the understanding,
the heart, and the will.
Bear in mind the power of sympathy
between human beings. He who has
received a truth desires to impart it.
He who has experienced the salvation
pities those who need it as he did.
He who speaks from his own experience
speaks with tenderness, and
earnestness, and influence. The sick
heed the recommendation of a physician
by those whom he has cured.
On this principle of adaptation the
Lord Jesus instituted the living
ministry of apostles, evangelists, pastors,
parents, all Christians. He inspired
some to put on permanent
record the truth as He revealed it, as
a standard of appeal. They are to
study it. They are to use the same
principle of adaptation. There is
youth, age, different measure of instruction,
different classes, spheres,
circumstances.</p>

<p><b>III. God intended to train those
whom He saved.</b> Believers are already
saved, because pardoned and sanctified.
But they require training into riper
holiness, greater usefulness, greater
fitness for the future heaven. Therefore
the Saviour instituted such means
as are adapted to secure these ends.
Church fellowship, public worship,
pastoral teaching, Christian habits of
watchfulness, thoughtfulness, prayer.
All these are adapted to the training
of the spiritual plant.</p>

<p>Are you in sympathy with God&rsquo;s
end? In yourselves? In the world?
Then adapt yourselves to its realisation.&mdash;<i>J. Rawlinson.</i></p>

<p class="gap" id="o250A">In these verses there are three
kinds of seed mentioned; fitches,
cummin, and corn. The fitches and
cummin were small seeds like the
<span class="pagenum" id="p311">[p.&nbsp;311]</span>
caraway or chickpea. When these
smaller herbs had to be threshed, this
was done by hand; but when the corn
had to be threshed, that was thrown
on the floor, and men would fasten
horses or oxen to a cart with iron-dented
wheels; that cart would be
drawn round the threshing-floor, and
so the work would be accomplished.
And so the idea expressed is different
kinds of threshing for different products.</p>

<p><b>I. We must all go through some
kind of threshing process.</b> The fact
that you are devoting your life to
honourable and noble purposes will
not win you any escape. Wilberforce,
the Christian Emancipator, was
in his day derisively called &ldquo;Doctor
Cantwell.&rdquo; Thomas Babington Macaulay,
the advocate of all that was good
long before he became the most conspicuous
historian of his day, was caricatured
in one of the <i>Quarterly Reviews</i>
as &ldquo;Bubble-tongued Macaulay.&rdquo; Norman
McLeod, the great friend of the
Scotch poor, was industriously maligned
in all quarters. As the small
wits of London took after John Wesley,
the father of Methodism. If such
men could not escape the maligning
of the world, neither can you expect
to get rid of the sharp, keen stroke of
the tribulum. All who will live godly
in Christ Jesus must suffer persecution.
<b>II.&nbsp;It is not compliment to us if we
escape great trial.</b> There are men
who suppose they are the Lord&rsquo;s
favourites, simply because their barns
are full, and their bank account is flush,
and there are no funerals in the house.
It may be because they are fitches and
cummin, while down at the end of the
lane, the poor widow may be the Lord&rsquo;s
corn. You are little pounded, because
you are little worth, and she bruised
and ground, because she is the best
part of the harvest. By carefulness
of the threshing, you may always
conclude the value of the grain. (H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I.,
186&ndash;196, 3692&ndash;3695). <b>III.&nbsp;God
proportions our trials to what we
can bear.</b> The rod for the cummin,
the staff for the fitches, the iron wheel
for the corn. (H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I., 179&ndash;188,
3674&ndash;3695). <b>IV.&nbsp;God continues trials
until we let go.</b> As soon as the farmer
sees that the straw has let go the grain,
he stops the threshing. We hold on
to this world with its pleasures, riches,
and emoluments, as though for ever.
God comes along with some threshing
trouble, and beats us loose. Oh, let
go! Depend upon it that God will
keep upon you the staff, or the rod,
or the iron wheel until you <i>do</i> let go.
<b>V.&nbsp;Christian sorrow is going to have a
sure terminus.</b> &ldquo;Bread corn is bruised,
because <i>He will not be ever threshing it.</i>&rdquo;
So much of us as is wheat will be separated
from so much of us as is chaff,
and there will be no more need of
pounding. &ldquo;He will not ever be
threshing it.&rdquo; Blessed be God for
that! (Rev. xxi.&nbsp;4).&mdash;<i>T.&nbsp;De&nbsp;Witt Talmage, D.D.</i></p>

<div class="footnotes"><h4 class="tdc">FOOTNOTES:</h4>
<div class="footnote" id="o250_fn1"><p><a href="#o250_fna1"><span class="label">[1]</span></a>
In this parable the mystery of the
Divine Providence is laid open, its secret disclosed.
<i>All ploughing is for sowing; all threshing
is intended for the preservation of the grain.</i>
When God chastens us, it is not that He means
to destroy us, but because He has set His heart
on saving us, because He has appointed us to
life and not to death. He works with discrimination.
He employs various methods,
sends sorrows of all sorts and sizes, that He
may adapt Himself to every man&rsquo;s needs, and
to all our varieties of place, time, and circumstances.
Just as the husbandman varies his
treatment of the soil, and allots to each kind
of seed a soil and place suitable to its kind;
just as, after the harvest has been gathered in,
he employs only such instruments as are best
adapted for separating the different kinds of
grain from the straw and the chaff. With
like wisdom and discretion God deals with us,
assigning to each of us our proper station and
lot, and, when we sin against Him, adapting
His judgments to our several needs. The sorrows,
losses, bereavements which befall us are
but as the sharp edge of the share, or the keen
teeth of the harrow, and are intended to prepare
us to receive the good seed, and to bring
forth much fruit. Or again, they are like the
stroke of the flail, or the keen pressure of the
sledge, or the ponderous oppression of the
waggon-wheel, or the swift rattle of the horses&rsquo;
hoofs; and are designed to separate the chaff
from the grain, the worthless from the worthy,
the evil from the good in us, that we may be
made meet for the garner of God. &ldquo;Cure sin
and you cure sorry,&rdquo; say the reason and conscience
of the world: <i>and the sorrow comes
that the sin may be cured,</i> adds the prophet;
the very miseries that spring from evil are
intended to eradicate the evil from which
they spring. The weeds call for the plough;
<span class="pagenum" id="p312">[p.&nbsp;312]</span>
and the plough comes at their call; but it
comes and cuts up the weeds and the ground
to which they have taken root, only that the
seeds of wholesome herbs and the herbs of grace
may be sown in the furrows. The chaff calls
for the flail, and the flail is sent, but sent only
to beat out the nourishing grain. Would that
this conception were as assured, and as familiar
to us as to the old Hebrew prophets!
For, sooner or later, we shall all have to endure
sorrows, which rend our hearts as the
ploughshare rends the ground, or which
bruise our hearts as the flail bruises the corn.&mdash;<i>S.

<p class="bq">xxviii.&nbsp;29. <i>This also cometh forth from the Lord of hosts, which is wonderful
in counsel, and excellent in working.</i></p>

<p>The sentiment of the text is that
<i>the art, and science, and skill of man are
the gifts of God.</i> The prophet instances
only agriculture, but the same principle
applies to all the arts and manufactures,
and in a higher degree still to
those sublimer sciences which elevate
the human mind, and make us acquainted
with the majestic and mysterious
powers of nature. The drift
of the writer of the text is this, <i>if
God thus instructs man in wisdom, how
wise must He be Himself!</i> If the mere
rays which come from Him convey to
us so much light that we are perfectly
astonished at what man can do, what
must be the infinite wisdom in counsel
and the excellence of working which
are to be discovered in God Himself!
There are two things which shall
occupy our attention. The first is,
<i>the vision of God which the text presents
to us;</i> and the second is, <i>the lesson which
such a vision is calculated to teach us.</i></p>

<p><b>I. The vision of God which is presented
to us in the text.</b> The great
principle of the text is that <i>God has a
plan, and that this plan is wonderful in
itself, and is found to be excellent when it
is carried out.</i> This is illustrated
1.&nbsp;<i>in nature.</i> All creation is full of traces
of design. &ldquo;He weighed the mountains
in scales, and the hills in a
balance.&rdquo; Nothing was made without
the most accurate calculation. The
stars seem cast about on the floor of
heaven as men might fling at random
gold-dust from their hands; yet there
is not a single star whose place might
be altered without mischief to the
whole arrangement. In the meanest
animal and minutest insect there are
the most admirable contrivances to
suit its habits and make its condition
happy. And apparent irregularity is
only undiscovered order. 2.&nbsp;<i>From
providence.</i> The great providential
operations of God are all the results
of His foredetermined purpose and
decree. All through human history
every lover of the Lord will see that
the awful wheels of providence have
worked with excellent regularity.
Empires have fallen, but the truth has
risen. Dynasties have perished, but
immortal principles have conquered.
3.&nbsp;<i>Your own personal experience of that
providence</i> goes to prove this with equal
clearness. How often have you seen
that God overrules all things for your
good! (H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I. 4015&ndash;4022). 4.&nbsp;The
wonderful planning of the excellent
Worker is seen in <i>the great economy of
Redemption.</i> How marvellous that
God, the Mighty Maker, should appear
in human flesh and become a
man, that so fallen, sinful, miserable
man might be lifted up and become
the son of God! When I see this
great sight these words of Isaiah&rsquo;s ring
with a bell-like music in my ears,
&ldquo;He is wonderful in counsel.&rdquo;
5.&nbsp;Then turning from Redemption itself,
look at <i>the Gospel.</i> That Gospel is
just the reverse of what human wisdom
would advise. It is not &ldquo;do and
live,&rdquo; but &ldquo;believe and live.&rdquo; 6.&nbsp;Then
I might speak of God&rsquo;s plan and God&rsquo;s
work <i>in inward experience.</i> The experience
of every Christian is in some
respects different from that of another,
but it is always the result of God&rsquo;s plan.
7.&nbsp;Another illustration will be found
<i>in the use of instrumentality.</i> It is a
wonderful design of God to use one
man in the conversion of another.
<span class="pagenum" id="p313">[p.&nbsp;313]</span>
The one is benefited while the other
is blessed. 8.&nbsp;The grandest, illustration
of all will be when, at last, <i>God&rsquo;s
counsels shall be perfectly fulfilled.</i> Man
shall burst forth into one mighty song,
&ldquo;Hallelujah! Hallelujah! the Lord
God Omnipotent reigneth!&rdquo; (Rev. xix.&nbsp;6).</p>

<p><b>II. Some of the lessons from it.</b>&mdash;1.&nbsp;To
the unconverted: seeing His
counsel is so wondrous, I would to
God <i>you would agree to it!</i> 2.&nbsp;To the
people of God: I want you <i>to agree to
this in your own particular case.</i>
3.&nbsp;Brother workers, let us have a well-formed
plan, and <i>let it be God&rsquo;s plan.</i>
4.&nbsp;When we know God&rsquo;s plan we
<i>must remember to carry it out.</i> 5.&nbsp;When
you are resolved to carry out God&rsquo;s
plan, <i>joyfully expect singular assistance.</i>&mdash;<i>C.&nbsp;H. Spurgeon.</i></p>

<h3 class="tdc" id="o252"><span class="smcap">Ariel.</span></h3>

<p class="bq">xxix.&nbsp;1. <i>Woe to Ariel, to Ariel, the city where David dwelt.</i></p>

<p>The word &ldquo;Ariel&rdquo; properly means
&ldquo;the Lion of God,&rdquo; and is elsewhere
used of the great brazen altar on which
the sacred fire blazed, and which
might be said to devour as a lion the
sacrifices presented on it to God. In
our text, however, &ldquo;Ariel&rdquo; is used as
a name for Jerusalem. The fact that
David had dwelt in it is mentioned,
not by way of historical reference, but
as aggravating the guiltiness of the
city, and as in some way proving that
it might expect to be visited with
more than common vengeance. In
what way is the fact that Jerusalem
could be described as &ldquo;the city where
David dwelt&rdquo; a justification of the
woes which the prophet was about to
denounce against it? The answer is
easy: <i>We are answerable to God for
every blessing received at His hands, so
that we cannot possess a single privilege
which will not, if neglected or abused, be
brought against us as a charge and
heighten our condemnation.</i> This is as
true of communities as of individuals:
and the fact that Jerusalem had
profited so little, morally and spiritually,
from David&rsquo;s residence in it was
a clear aggravation of its guilt.&mdash;1.&nbsp;<b>David
had dwelt in Jerusalem as a
king.</b> As such, his authority and his
example might have been expected to
have made a deep impression on the
religious life of the people. Consider
how powerful is the example of men
in exalted stations.&mdash;2.&nbsp;<b>David had
dwelt in Jerusalem as a poet.</b> Consider
how powerful is the influence of
song on national character, and how
truly David&rsquo;s psalms were national
songs. As every English child is taught
loyalty by the notes of &ldquo;God save the
Queen,&rdquo; every Jewish child was instructed
in piety by the well-known
strains of the sweet singer of Israel.
Surely if anything could have kept
religion alive in Jerusalem, it would
have been this writing it into the
poetry this weaving it into the music
of the nation. It was like taking possession
of the strings of a nation&rsquo;s
heart, and providing that their vibrations
should respond only to truth.&mdash;3.&nbsp;<b>The
memory of David had long
been a blessing to Jerusalem.</b> For
his sake evil had been averted from
it (2&nbsp;Kings xix.&nbsp;34). To pronounce
a woe upon the Jerusalem or the city
where David had dwelt was to tell the
Jews that the conservative influence
of that monarch&rsquo;s piety would no
longer be of any avail for them; that
even as children, though long spared
in recompense by the righteousness of
their fathers, may reach a point at
which they have filled the measure of
their guilt, and at which, therefore,
they can receive no further favour as
the offspring of those whom God hath
loved; so their iniquity had reached
such a height that forbearance, long
manifested for the sake of the most
pious of kings, was at length wearied
out, and there remained no further
place for intercession.</p>

<p>The principle involved in this passage
is applicable alike to <i>communities</i>
and <i>individuals.</i> 1.&nbsp;It is made the
charge against Jerusalem that it was
<span class="pagenum" id="p314">[p.&nbsp;314]</span>
the city where David had dwelt&mdash;the
plain inference from this being that it
was a great aggravation of the national
wickedness that so righteous a prince,
so zealous a supporter of true religion
as David, had sat for years upon the
throne of Judah. By parity of reasoning,
if there have been raised up in
our own country men mighty in the
exhibiting and establishing truth, and
if in the lapse of time we grow indifferent
to the truth, and perhaps even
half inclined to the errors which were
exposed and expelled, will it not be
made a matter of accusation against
us that ours is the land in which those
worthies dwelt? Suppose, for example,
we were to undervalue the Reformation,
suppose we were to think lightly
of the errors of Popery, then might our
text be regarded as denouncing special
woe on ourselves&mdash;woe to England&mdash;to
England, the country where Wickliffe,
and Cranmer, and Ridley dwelt!
For is it not to be questioned that
we shall have much to answer for it,
after God had raised up Reformers,
and they, with incalculable labour and
at incalculable cost, had cleansed our
Church from the abominations of Popery,
we should in any measure let go
the truth and make alliance or truce
with the tenets or practices of Rome.
This same principle is applicable
2.&nbsp;to many a parish in which some devoted
minister of Christ has laboured,
and 3.&nbsp;to many a household in which
the example and teaching of godly
parents have been set at naught.&mdash;<i>H.

<h3 class="tdc" id="o253"><span class="smcap">Dreaming.</span></h3>

<p class="bq">xxix.&nbsp;7, 8. <i>Shall be as a dream of a night vision, &amp;c.</i></p>

<p>The reference in these two verses
is to the threatened attack on Jerusalem
by the Assyrian invasion in the
reign of Hezekiah. They take us to
the time the invader had taken all the
other fortified places in the kingdom;
and now his general, Rabshakeh, was
encamped before the capital, with the
confident expectation of easily taking
it. It would seem as if, the requisite
preparations having been made, that
immense army had retired to rest,
with the intention of making the assault
on the next day. We can imagine
them in their dreams picturing
to themselves the scenes of the approaching
capture, the shouting, the
onset, the slaughter, the devastation,
the prisoners, the booty, the triumph,
the glory&mdash;scenes, however, <i>these</i> which
they were destined never to witness!
For, in the dead of night, the Destroying
Angel went forth, and in the
morning nothing remained of 185,000
of them but their lifeless corpses. So
ended their dreams!</p>

<p>Even as the army of Sennacherib
was dreaming of a conquest which
had no real existence, <i>so are there multitudes
of persons now dreaming that they
are accomplishing the great object of their
existence who are no more doing so than
if they lay wrapped in the slumbers of
the night.</i> I propose to speak of such
persons under three heads of
<span class="smcap">Pleasure, Work, Religion.</span></p>

<p>I. <span class="smcap">Pleasure.</span> I am not condemning
pleasure. Pleasure has its place in
every human life, just as truly as
work and religion. I am speaking of
a life <i>devoted</i> to pleasure. Nor do I
speak of the grosser pleasures&mdash;these
shock us at once, others delude us&mdash;but
of those whose great aim in life is
to please <i>themselves:</i> who, in respect
to any proposed course of action, never
think of asking, &ldquo;Is it my <i>duty?</i>&rdquo; But
what is there to show that such a life
is only a dream-like substitute for real
life? 1.&nbsp;<i>It leaves our best faculties unused.</i>
Can it be believed that God
made us &ldquo;a little lower than the angels&rdquo;
that we might spend our lives
in pursuits which hardly require the
faculties of a man? 2.&nbsp;A life of
pleasure is a <i>selfish life.</i> Where pleasure
is the habitual object of pursuit
there <i>must</i> be selfishness. Wherever
<span class="pagenum" id="p315">[p.&nbsp;315]</span>
pleasure is the great object of life, <i>the
interest of others will be held in low
esteem.</i> 3.&nbsp;A life of pleasure also exposes
to temptation. 4.&nbsp;It unfits men
for another world. We shall never
be ready for heaven if we never think
seriously about it; and pleasure pre-eminently
withdraws our thoughts
from that world (H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I., 5059).</p>

<p>II. Another form of the dream is
the impression that <span class="smcap">work,</span> <i>i.e., secular
occupation, is the great business of life.</i>
Work is not to be spoken of without
respect. 1.&nbsp;The <i>Bible praises work.</i>
&ldquo;Six days shalt thou labour.&rdquo;
2.&nbsp;<i>It keeps us from dependence on others.</i>
3.&nbsp;<i>It benefits those dependent upon us.</i>
4.&nbsp;It is good as enabling a man <i>to
help his neighbours.</i> 5.&nbsp;Good as giving
a man <i>influence</i> by means of the
wealth it produces. 6.&nbsp;Good <i>as keeping
us out of much evil.</i> Intemperance
is usually the vice of the idle. So of
other vices. But still it has its dangerous
side. It shuts out the other
world by the undue prominence it gives
to this. It diminishes our sympathy
with the suffering, and makes us unconcerned
about the kingdom of Christ.
Noble as work is when compared with
idleness, it is not the great business of
life. God did not endow us with intellect,
heart, and spirit, with relations
to Himself, to our fellows, and to
immortality, that we might spend our
lives in a practical denial of them all.
A life of mere work is a dream as truly
as a life of pleasure.</p>

<p>III. Another thing which men are
apt to consider the great business of
life is <span class="smcap">religion.</span> In many cases &ldquo;religion&rdquo;
is little more than amusement;
in others superstition; in others mere
sentiment. There is a &ldquo;religion&rdquo;
which is merely an affair of the intellect;
another where it is hereditary,
where a man follows a form of religion
because his fathers did so before him.
It is forgotten that religion is a life.
Religious knowledge, beliefs, feelings,
exercises are but the scaffolding and
not the building; means to an end,
not the end itself. The great end of
life is not to be <i>religious,</i> but to be
<i>good.</i> True religion has two sides:
it first puts us right with God and
then with our fellow-men. We love
God first, and only then do we love
man and work for his good.</p>

<p>The prophet tells us how the dreams
of these Assyrians vanished. Even
such will be the disappointment of
those who are dreaming away the
grand possibilities of the present life.&mdash;<i>B.&nbsp;P.

Pulpit,</i> vol. iii. pp. 187&ndash;191.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 class="tdc" id="o254"><span class="smcap">Awakened from the Dream.</span></h3>

<p class="bq">xxix.&nbsp;8. <i>It shall be even as when an hungry man dreameth, and behold he eateth;
but he awaketh, and his soul is empty.</i></p>

<p>This passage describes the disappointment
of the Assyrians, whose
imagination had feasted on the conquest
of Jerusalem. The simile is
striking. A man in extreme hunger
or thirst will dream that his craving
is satisfied. He awakes to feel the
privation more acutely. The text may
be applied to the case of a man disappointed
with the world, awakened
to a sense of its emptiness, concerned
for his soul. There is a sense of sin,
danger, need. On the day of Pentecost
the awakened cried, &ldquo;What shall
we do?&rdquo; Thus the Philippian Jailor.
We will address this state of mind&mdash;</p>

<p><b>I. In words of sympathy.</b> The
awakened solicitude is justified by&mdash;1.&nbsp;the
value of the soul; 2.&nbsp;the fact of sin;
3.&nbsp;the reality of danger; 4.&nbsp;the provision
of the gospel; 5.&nbsp;the call of
God; 6.&nbsp;the unsatisfactoriness of neglect;
7.&nbsp;the flight of time.</p>

<p><b>II. In words of caution.</b> 1.&nbsp;Beware
of relapsing into indifference
(H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I., 1479&ndash;1490). Many are
awakened and anxious, but it does
not endure. Herod heard John gladly
and did many things. Transient impressions
are like Ephraim&rsquo;s goodness
(Hos. vi.&nbsp;4). Some are excitable but
fickle. When the charm of novelty
<span class="pagenum" id="p316">[p.&nbsp;316]</span>
departs, their enthusiasm departs. Religion
experiences similar treatment.
Nor is it from yourself alone that you
are exposed to this peril. You will
meet with those who will endeavour
to repress your earnestness. They
will commend a moderate attention to
religion, but will counsel you to wait
until you are older, &amp;c. A quiet,
sober, decent attention to religious
duties is well enough, but they cannot
see the necessity for making religion
the primary concern. Beware of such
advisers. This is a matter in which
earnestness is demanded. Keep fresh
and vigorous in your mind the considerations
by which you were first
awakened. Salvation is either the
supremely important thing the gospel
declares, or it is nothing. Is the sick
man too anxious for health, too attentive
to the physician&rsquo;s directions?
When the starving man has dreamed
of food, does any one repress his eagerness
for the reality when, on awaking,
he finds it was only a dream? Beware
lest either unsympathising friends or
your own weakness administer the
opiate that will send you back into
the slumber of indifference from which
you have been awakened. 2.&nbsp;Beware
of assuming that you are converted
because you are awakened. Awakening
is not conversion. Conviction is
not conversion; it does not necessarily
end up in it. Pharaoh said, &ldquo;I have
sinned.&rdquo; It is a hopeful circumstance;
a step on the road; attention called
to the disease; disappearance of the
dream. The awakened on the day of
Pentecost were directed respecting conversion.
3.&nbsp;Beware of finding comfort
anywhere else than in the gospel.
Performance of religious duties; prayers;
peaceful feeling, you know not
why; impression that you are forgiven.
It is untempered mortar; it will not
bind the walls. Nothing less than
faith in Jesus.</p>

<p><b>III. In words of counsel.</b> Comply
at once with the call of the Gospel.
Christ&rsquo;s work is all-sufficient. Faith
and repentance is submission at both
points. The call is&mdash;1.&nbsp;Gracious.
2.&nbsp;Immediate. Do not delay; do not
wait for the Spirit nor anything else.
You are a man, not a machine. You
must obey the Gospel. The Spirit is
working with the Gospel.&mdash;<i>John Rawlinson.</i></p>

<h3 class="tdc" id="o255"><span class="smcap">The Futility of Fighting against Mount Zion.</span></h3>

<p class="tdc">(<i>Missionary Sermon.</i>)</p>

<p class="bq">xxix.&nbsp;8. <i>So shall the multitude of the nations be that fight against Mount Zion.</i></p>

<p>Nothing tends to inspirit exertion
in any great enterprise so much as the
certain prospect of success. Hope is
the spur of action, the very life of
enterprise. Hence to encourage the
fearful and animate the brave in the
culture of their own piety, and especially
in their efforts to extend the
kingdom of the Redeemer, there are
given in God&rsquo;s Word the amplest promises
of Divine help and assurances of
ultimate success. But for &ldquo;the sure
word of prophecy,&rdquo; the servants of
God would long since have trembled
for the ark of the Lord, and have despaired
of the salvation of the race.
But delays to us are not delays with
God. Long ago He has declared, &ldquo;Yet
have I set my King on my holy hill of
Zion.&rdquo; &ldquo;But we see not as yet all
things put under Him.&rdquo; The foot of
His Providence falls too soft for mortal
ear to mark. While He walks on the
great ocean of human affairs as Jesus
walked on the Galilean sea, His footsteps
leave no traces behind. But yet
He never stands still. &ldquo;My father
worketh hitherto.&rdquo; His progress is
certain. In reference to the spread of
His Gospel it may be said, &ldquo;In such
an hour as ye think not the Son of
man shall come.&rdquo; At His approach all
opposition is fruitless, all resistance
vain. Every obstacle shall vanish, as
a dream is forgotten when the dreamer
awaketh.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="p317">[p.&nbsp;317]</span>
This passage suggests&mdash;</p>

<p><b>I. The number and might of the
enemies of the Gospel.</b> It is always
unwise to underrate the forces of the
enemy. Injury has been done to the
cause of missions by this action. Good
men in the ardour of their zeal seemed
to speak as though heathendom was
to be won by one new crusade, and that
the walls of Satan&rsquo;s kingdom would fall
flat at a single blast of their rams&rsquo; horns.
But Scripture takes opposite ground,
and intimates that there must be a
continuous and persistent struggle.
Our great General does not conquer
in a single campaign; He goes forth
&ldquo;conquering and to conquer.&rdquo; These
numerous and powerful enemies of
Christ&rsquo;s kingdom arise from our own
corrupt nature; from the peculiar
circumstances of the heathen world;
from every class of society, and are
perpetually set in motion by the
powers of darkness. Though they are
&ldquo;the multitude of all the nations,&rdquo;
they have one prince, &ldquo;the prince of
the powers of darkness.&rdquo; To prevent
our forming exaggerated pictures of
success, let us remember: 1.&nbsp;<i>That the
original enmity of the human heart is
always and everywhere the same.</i> Every
sinful passion of the human heart
starts up an armed enemy against
Christ and His truth. If at home
after centuries of Christian work, the
obstacles to the gospel are so great,
how much more formidable must they
be in pagan lands! 2.&nbsp;<i>The power of
Satan is at all times the same.</i> And if
here he rules supreme in the children
of disobedience, what must his power
be in those heathen lands where he is
so strongly entrenched in superstition,
idolatry and prejudices, crimes and
passions of men confederated with
him since Adam fell! 3.&nbsp;<i>The world
at large, in its spirit and pursuits, is
decidedly hostile.</i> Even in our own
country, how few can be looked upon
as the genuine disciples of Christ, the
true soldiers of the Cross! How
mighty the forces sent out even here
against the Lord and against His
anointed! This part of the earth is
still in the hands of the wicked.</p>

<p><b>II. The utter futility and certain
overthrow of their projects.</b> 1.&nbsp;<i>Their
schemes are all fallacious and visionary.</i>
&ldquo;It shall be as when a hungry man
dreameth.&rdquo; What more delusive than
a dream! 2.&nbsp;<i>Their disappointment is
certain.</i> The history of the past is
against them. Past history has verified
the words of the Master, &ldquo;And
the gates of hell shall not prevail
against it&rdquo; (Matt. xvi.&nbsp;18). The prophecy of the
covenant of grace, the very progress
of civilisation, but more than all the
very existence of God, is against
them. &ldquo;The Lord reigneth; let the
earth rejoice&rdquo; (Ps. xcvii.&nbsp;1).</p>

<p><b>III. The glory that shall rise from
thence to Zion&rsquo;s King</b> (Ps. lxxii.&nbsp;10, 11,
15). His wisdom will baffle all their
designs, His power crush every hostile
force, and His kingdom rise on the
ruin of their dark confederacies (1&nbsp;Cor.

<p class="bq">xxix.&nbsp;13, 14. <i>Wherefore the Lord said, Forasmuch as this people drew near to Me
with their mouth, &amp;c.</i></p>

<p>The charge against the people is
clear; it is that of a heartless religion,
formal and full of hypocrisy. &ldquo;Their
fear toward me is taught by the <i>precept

a mechanical following of human directions,
instead of the spontaneous uprising
of a heart inspired with the fear
and love of God.</p>

<p><b>I. The charge against the Jews in

of the heart and the substitution
of a lip-service. <i>The removal of the
heart.</i> God demands the service of
the heart (Prov. xxiii.&nbsp;26; Jer. xxix.&nbsp;13).
The Psalmist felt how reasonable
was this demand when he said,
&ldquo;I will praise Thee, O Lord, with the
<span class="pagenum" id="p318">[p.&nbsp;318]</span>
<i>whole heart</i>&rdquo; (Ps. ix.&nbsp;1). A man may
do some things with a slack hand and
yet be blameless, but to steer an
Atlantic steamer in a storm, he needs
the whole force of both hands. Unless
our whole soul be in God&rsquo;s service,
our worship will be thrown back upon
us with the withering words, &ldquo;Who
hath demanded <i>this</i> at your hands?&rdquo;
This worthless thing! &ldquo;Bring no
more vain oblations.&rdquo; How strikingly
our Lord put this principle of supremacy
(Luke xiv.&nbsp;26): &ldquo;In every man&rsquo;s
heart I must be supreme, or therein I
cannot dwell.&rdquo; Infidels must ignorantly
misread this passage. One of
their counts against Christianity is
that it frowns on family joys; while
every day&rsquo;s facts prove that the truest
Christian is the best husband, father,
&amp;c. God being first in a man&rsquo;s heart,
that heart is humanised, its generosity
enlarged, so as to take in, not only the
family, but &ldquo;all mankind.&rdquo; But some,
after having given their hearts to the
Lord, withdraw them from His service
(Matt. xiii.&nbsp;22; 2&nbsp;Tim. iv.&nbsp;10).</p>

<p><b>II. This charge has been true in
every generation.</b> The heart&rsquo;s weakness
and the world&rsquo;s force are ever the
same. This evil existed in our Lord&rsquo;s
day (Matt. xv.&nbsp;8, 9). For long years
before the Reformation whole nations
of Christendom presented to God a
mere formal worship. And to-day, of
how many congregations may the
words of Ezekiel be said! (Ezek. xxxiii.&nbsp;31).</p>

<p><b>III. The worthless substitution presented
to God.</b> &ldquo;And with their lips
do honour Me.&rdquo; The instinct of worship
is so strong within the soul that
men everywhere worship something.
It may be the hideous fetish of the
African or the artistic statue of the
refined Greek, but something the
Greek and the barbarian must have.
When that young mother, in the days
of Solomon, arose in the morning and
found a dead child by her side instead
of her own living one, how severe
must have been the shock! Had there
been no child by her side, no dead
substitute, she might have thought
that her own child lived somewhere
and might sometime be found. But
that dead substitute at first nearly
killed her by despair. It is bad to
withdraw a living heart from the Lord,
but to substitute a dead one is first to
rob God and then wickedly insult Him
(H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I., 5066&ndash;5070).</p>

<p><b>IV. The threat</b> (ver. 14). The
threat is that of <i>cherished expectations
bitterly disappointed.</i> In times of extremity,
full of confidence in the
wisdom of their leaders, they shall
seek light and leading, and behold
nothing but darkness and folly. How
often have the leaders of a nation been
stricken with folly, and, like a blinded
steersman, have driven the ship to
destruction! &ldquo;The wisdom of their
wise men shall perish.&rdquo; Disappointment!
It is only another expression
about the foolish man disappointed in
his false security, his house resting on
the sand, and of those who &ldquo;make
lies their refuge, and under falsehood
hide themselves.&rdquo; The threat is that
&ldquo;the hail shall sweep away the refuge
of lies, and the waters shall overflow
the hiding-place.&rdquo; Though men may
not admit that their worship is mere
lip-service, and their neighbours not
see their hypocrisy, yet to the eye of
God</p>

<p class="gap" id="o256A">Two conditions under which religion
is in a declining state. 1.&nbsp;When the
ordinances of Divine worship are
generally neglected. 2.&nbsp;When the attendance
on worship, however large,
does not represent a religious state of

The latter was the state
into which religion had fallen in Judea.
The religious observances of the people
were not inspired by knowledge of
God&rsquo;s Word, but by human authority.
The text&mdash;</p>

<p><b>I. Describes a great privilege.</b>
&ldquo;This people draw near me.&rdquo; God
speaks after the manner of men. When
we desire to speak closely to a friend
we get near him. This is coming
close to God (Ps. lxxiii.&nbsp;28; Heb. x.&nbsp;22;
Heb. vii.&nbsp;19; James iv.&nbsp;8). Is it
<span class="pagenum" id="p319">[p.&nbsp;319]</span>
not a wonder that the Almighty permits
us to draw nigh to Him? Men
make it difficult for their inferiors to
obtain access; but the Infinite and
Eternal One makes Himself accessible
to His creatures. Not only so; He has
made a way for creatures stained by
sin. The Lord Jesus Christ stands
between God and man by virtue of
His atoning death and interceding
life. The guilty, condemned, utterly
impure, have only to renounce their
sinfulness and avail themselves of this
new and living way. If there is truthfulness
and sincerity, they will be welcome.
In the sanctuary, in meeting
for prayer, in the family, in the closet,
in the round of daily duty, we may draw
near to God. Do you know anything
of the blessedness of this privilege?
Enjoyment, comfort, purity, fitness for
intercourse with men, for the battle of
life, for the work of the world, do they
not all come through this privilege?</p>

<p><b>II. Points out a serious abuse</b> (ver.
13). Their sin was not the abandonment
of worship. That is a measure
of ungodliness not reached without a
long process. Unsettled faith, indifference
to spiritual blessings, habits
of sinful indulgence, conduct to it.
What multitudes have reduced themselves
to this predicament? But it
was not their case. They had not
relinquished the ordinances of worship;
they observed them. But there
was a twofold defect: the heart was
absent and the motive was wrong.
1.&nbsp;<i>Something was present that ought to
have been absent.</i> &ldquo;Their fear toward
Me is taught by the precept of men.&rdquo;
Their piety was only out of respect
for some human authority. Our Lord
quoted this part of the text in His exposure
of externalism as exemplified
by the Pharisees of His time (Matt.
xv.&nbsp;9). Human authority in religion
is here distinctly denounced. One
man may hand the Word of God to
another, but no man must impose his
notions of religion on another by his
mere authority. A man&rsquo;s religious
service must be the result of his personal
conviction. If he is religious
because some one else is, or because
it is respectable, or because it may
promote his worldly interest, or because
it is recognised and imposed by
the authority of the state, it is not
really the honour and worship of God
at all, but of man. 2.&nbsp;<i>Something was
absent that ought to have been present.</i>
&ldquo;But have removed their heart far
from Me.&rdquo; God must be worshipped
with the heart. Apart from the outward
expression of inward reality, the
movement of the lips and the utterance
of the mouth are nothing. Real
worship is the consent of the understanding,
will, affections, to the homage
which is paid by the lips. Without
this they are mockery, as when one
who stands in the king&rsquo;s presence is
alienated from his allegiance.</p>

<p><b>III. Utters a solemn warning</b> (ver.
14). Their religion was only the
counsel of man. It was unavailing
for its purpose, and would come to
nothing (1&nbsp;Cor. i.&nbsp;19). Such worship
is: 1.&nbsp;<i>Unacceptable.</i> God is not deceived.
Realise the terribleness of being
rejected. He says, &ldquo;It is not the
kind of worship I require.&rdquo; After all
your wisdom (Isa. i.&nbsp;11&ndash;15). 2.&nbsp;<i>Unsuccessful.</i>
The prayers offered only
by the lips are not heard. No answer
comes, no blessing descends. This
comes of the policy which followed
the precepts of men. 3.&nbsp;<i>Unstable.</i>
After such religion reaction may be
expected. There is no inward life to
sustain the outward exercises. Does
not the test point to that deeper spiritual
blindness which follows the attempt
to put the wisdom of man in
the place of the wisdom of God?</p>

<p>In religion and at its worship take
care: 1.&nbsp;That there is <i>sincerity.</i> See
that the heart is right with God.
&ldquo;Ye must be born again.&rdquo; 2.&nbsp;That
there is <i>simplicity.</i> Let there be no
superfluous externalism in worship;
only what is necessary to the suitable
expression of the heart&rsquo;s worship.
3.&nbsp;That there is <i>earnestness.</i></p>

<p>And if a merely formal worship is
rejected, what is the predicament of
those who do not even offer that, but
who live without any acknowledgement
of God?&mdash;<i>John Rawlinson.</i></p>

<h3 class="tdc" id="o257"><span class="smcap">The Joy of the Meek.</span></h3>

<p class="bq">xxix.&nbsp;19. <i>The meek also shall increase their joy in the Lord.</i></p>

<p>I. <span class="smcap">The persons here described.</span></p>

<p>Meekness does not mean timidity
(2&nbsp;Tim. i.&nbsp;7); not the craven spirit of
the coward, but the quiet power of
the strong man (Prov. xxviii.&nbsp;1). It
does not mean the absence of courage,
but the absence of that ignorant and
arrogant self-sufficiency which Peter
showed when he said, &ldquo;Though all
men forsake Thee, yet will not I.&rdquo; It
is that calmness of spirit which grows
not out of reliance on self, but out of
reliance on God. It is recorded of
one whose courage at times had
flashed up like a consuming fire,
&ldquo;Now the man Moses was very meek,
above all the men which were upon the
face of the earth.&rdquo; His meekness was
not feebleness, but a calm strength;
quiet endurance in the doing of duty
under difficulties. He was not provoked
by the wrong-headedness or
irritated by the ingratitude of the
nation he wished to serve, but he
quietly bore their stubbornness, and
persisted in doing them good against
their will. Hence a quiet doing and
a quiet bearing of the will of God
is one consistent in this quality of the
mind &ldquo;meekness.&rdquo; It does not mean
that equableness of disposition which
comes from nature, so much as that
calmness of spirit which comes from
grace. It is one of the fruits of the
Spirit (Gal. v.&nbsp;23). This quality of
mind in God&rsquo;s people is shown: 1.&nbsp;<i>In
their intercourse with God.</i> In His presence
they manifest &ldquo;a humble, lowly,
and contrite heart.&rdquo; Theirs is not
the spirit of the Pharisee, but the
lowly contrition of the publican. Not
&ldquo;Stand by, for I am holier than
thou,&rdquo; but &ldquo;I am not worthy,&rdquo; &amp;c.
In a ready acceptance of the doctrines
of grace and salvation through a
Saviour crucified. Not like the Pharisees,
who scorned the Saviour &ldquo;as a
root out of a dry ground,&rdquo; but like
those few elect souls, just and devout,
who &ldquo;were waiting for the consolation
of Israel.&rdquo; Christianity is a
discipline of humility. In making
men Christ-like it makes them meek.
Jesus was meek and lowly, and He
promises to those like Himself rest of
soul. 2.&nbsp;<i>In their submission to the allotments
of Providence</i> (Job xiv.&nbsp;14, xiii.&nbsp;15;
Micah vii.&nbsp;9; Lev. x.&nbsp;3; 1&nbsp;Sam.
iii.&nbsp;18; H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I. 157, 158, &amp;c.) 3.&nbsp;<i>In
their deportment before their fellow-men.</i>
They do not arrogate to themselves
that superiority which despises and
neglects others, but obey the apostolic
injunctions (1&nbsp;Pet. ii.&nbsp;17, iii.&nbsp;8).</p>

<p>II. <span class="smcap">The blessings God confers
upon them.</span></p>

<p>1. <i>He saves them.</i> Often in outward
troubles they become the charge and
care of His providence (Zeph. ii.&nbsp;3).
How wonderfully was Moses saved
from the strivings and rebellions of
the people! Leaving his vindication
in the hands of the Great Judge, God
took up his cause; and when the
whole camp was against him, God
delivered him. How wonderfully
was Joseph delivered from the pit
and the prison, and Jeremiah in
the siege! But always are they saved
from soul-destruction. &ldquo;Saved in the
Lord with an everlasting salvation.&rdquo;
2.&nbsp;<i>He beautifies them.</i> &ldquo;He will
beautify the meek with salvation.&rdquo;
By the robe of righteousness, the
inward adorning of the soul in every
virtue, by the special manifestation
of His mercy when most needed
(chap. lxi.&nbsp;3), by giving them that
esteem and commanding influence
which often attracts and impresses
their fellow-men. 3.&nbsp;<i>He makes it
appear that He delights in them.</i> &ldquo;The
Lord taketh pleasure in His people.&rdquo;</p>

<p>III. <span class="smcap">Their grateful response.</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;The poor among men shall rejoice
in the Holy One of Israel.&rdquo; They
rejoice in His salvation; they praise
Him in voice, and heart, and life (Isa.
lxi.&nbsp;10).&mdash;<i>Samuel Thodey.</i></p>

<p>&nbsp;<span class="pagenum" id="p321">[p.&nbsp;321]</span></p>
<h3 class="tdc" id="o258"><span class="smcap">Religious Joy.</span></h3>

<p class="bq">xxix.&nbsp;19. <i>The meek shall increase their joy.</i></p>

<p>It is commonly said that while religion
is man&rsquo;s duty and his interest, it
is not productive of enjoyment. Yet
the Bible is full of joyful expressions,
and of exhortations to joy. It even
meets the sorrows of humanity and
brings joy out of them. Its association
of joy with conditions not joyful
is remarkable (Matt. v.&nbsp;3&ndash;5).
Observe the contrasts in our passage
(vers. 18, 19). Circumstances are mentioned
which amount to the removal
of all alarm (ver. 20). From the outward
fact, the faith of the persons
here described ruses to the hand that
accomplished it.</p>

<p>Our subject is religious joy.</p>

<p>I. <span class="smcap">The source whence it is derived.</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;The Lord. The Holy One of
Israel.&rdquo; We rejoice in what we have
desired, hoped for, and obtained.
This does not exclude enjoyment of
the blessings of the present life.
They are closely associated with it.
They suggest it. We ask whence
they come. The habit of regarding
earthly advantage as gifts from the
hand of God keeps the Divine character
before us as that of a Being to
be regarded with pleasure.</p>

<p>Thus, if we ascend to the spiritual
region and contemplate the salvation
of man, it includes the compassionate
love of God, which gave
His Son to impoverishment, suffering,
and death; full forgiveness of sin; the
various influences of the Divine Spirit;
the elevated spiritual privileges and
hopes bestowed on fallen men. All
this came from the grace of God; it
originated in His nature. &ldquo;God is
love.&rdquo; But the God whose nature
can be read in this way is not a God
to repel, but attract; not a god of
whom to stand in terrified awe, but a
God in whom to rejoice.</p>

<p>And this result emerges if we take
a more direct look at the Divine character.
We are supplied with verbal
asservations as well as historical illustrations.
We read of the Almighty,
the All-wise, the All-righteous, the
All-holy, as well as the All-loving.
Power, even with justice, would fail
to produce joy. But a God of power,
and love, and holiness can be a delight,
because He can be loved.</p>

<p>But no object of delight can be considered
apart from its subject. Nothing
is universally delightful. Before you
can enjoy anything you must have
sympathy with it, a taste for it.
There are people who cannot enjoy
the finest concert. There must be the
heart that is capable of joy in the
Holy One of Israel, the heart of &ldquo;the
meek, the poor among men;&rdquo; the
heart changed by the grace of God.</p>

<p>II. <span class="smcap">The elements of which it
consists.</span></p>

<p>We know our feelings better by
experience than by analysis. We
can imagine a father so utterly unsatisfactory
in his character and conduct
that his own children are ashamed
to mention his name. We can imagine
one whose kindness, whose faultless
conduct, whose commanding intellect
render them proud of his name. They
think of him with pleasure. Thus the
poor among men rejoice in the Holy
One of Israel.</p>

<p>If you attempt to examine, you will
find that your joy in God is compounded
of several other feelings,
which, like tributary streams, swell
with the river of your pleasure.
1.&nbsp;<i>Gratitude.</i> For experience of the Divine
goodness. It expresses itself in thanks
and songs. You think with pleasure
of one for whom you are grateful.
2.&nbsp;<i>Affection.</i> Love is closely akin to gratitude.
And God has taken away all
cause of alienation. The love of God
in Christ possesses the heart. Love
delights in its object (Rom. v.&nbsp;11).
3.&nbsp;<i>Confidence.</i> We trust Him entirely.
In present distresses or future fears.
If distrust crosses our minds, we dismiss
it as inconsistent with the truth
of which we have satisfied ourselves.
<span class="pagenum" id="p322">[p.&nbsp;322]</span>
Now if there is perfect confidence in
Him on whom we depend, we cannot
fail to rejoice in Him. 4.&nbsp;<i>Approbation.</i>
We find the Holy One of Israel a
Being in whom we can be infinitely
satisfied. At no point, in no respect,
could we desire Him to be different
from what He is. Nor is it the admiration
sometimes expressed for characters
there is no desire to imitate.
Christians earnestly desire likeness to
God. Putting all these together, there
must be joy in the Lord.</p>

<p>III. <span class="smcap">The augmentation which it
receives.</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;The meek shall increase their joy
in the Lord.&rdquo; Earthly joy is short-lived.
The objects from which it proceeds
are liable to change and perish.
Many of these, even if they continue,
fall. They become flat by satiety and
continuity. We outgrow them as a
child outgrows his toys. But Christian
joy is permanent and tends to
increase, because its object remains
the same for ever, while His fulness
is ever unfolding itself. Knowing and
experiencing more of God, there is
more joy in Him. Thus there is a
constant increase&mdash;in the <i>present</i> world,
and in the <i>world to come.</i></p>

<p>Would you enjoy this privilege?
Then make it possible. Possess the
character. Ye must be born again.
Do not indulge sin. Keep Christ in
your thoughts. Thus you will be
superior to earthly enjoyments.&mdash;<i>John
Rawlinson.</i></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 class="tdc" id="o259"><span class="smcap">The Origin and the End of Sin.</span></h3>

<p class="bq">xxx.&nbsp;1&ndash;3. <i>Woe to the rebellious children, saith the Lord, that take counsel, but not
of Me, &amp;c.</i></p>

<p>The policy inculcated by the Divine
Ruler on the Jewish nation was a policy
of isolation. Now, this would be a
self-destructive policy. But the circumstances
of that nation were peculiar.
It was not a missionary to the
world, but it was a witness. When
it formed alliances with surrounding
nations, its witness became indistinct.
It often dropped its testimony and
adopted the idolatries against which
its protest should have been uniform.
This prophecy is against the alliance
with Egypt. Assyria was about to
invade that country. It was feared
she would take Judea on the way.
Now, the Lord was its defence; there
was therefore no need to seek assistance
from any other power whatsoever.
It was a rebellious and unbelieving
spirit that sought this alliance. The
politicians sought a covering from the
impending storm; but they did not
seek it by Divine counsel. They were
adding another sin to the number
against them. It would be shame
and confusion at the end. Egypt
would be unwilling or unable to help.</p>

<p>Human nature is ever the same.
Here is a representation of the way
in which sinners act, and of its consequences.</p>

<p><b>I. All sin proceeds from neglect and
defiance of God&rsquo;s counsel.</b></p>

<p>1. It is implied that God has counselled
or may be consulted respecting
human conduct. By the prophet He
had declared against the alliance with
Egypt. In the written word we have
His will. It does not deal with our
modern life and circumstances in detail.
Impossible. But we have what
is better; principles of action which
we are to apply to circumstances. No
one ever long in a moral difficulty, if
he honestly apply these principles.
Every act which is of the nature of
evil is forbidden. Many sinful acts
are forbidden by name. We have the
example of the Son of God. We
have the most inspiring motives; gratitude,
love, hope, fear. A revolution
of our nature in the direction of God&rsquo;s
holiness is demanded. The ministry
of the Word expounds and enforces
these great principles. Men do not
sin for want of counsel from God.</p>

<p>2. Our text charges men with acting
on other counsel than the Divine. The
charge is twofold. (1.)&nbsp;<i>Neglect of the</i>
<span class="pagenum" id="p323">[p.&nbsp;323]</span>
<i>counsel they ought to have sought.</i> Sincere
desire to be right would apply to
the Divine Word in relation to all the
conduct of life. How many adopt and
act upon the principle that it shall
guide everything? Is not its authority
discounted? When tempted to the
questionable or sinful, but advantageous,
how many, with steady clearness
of moral vision, look straight at
God&rsquo;s counsel? As to the ministry of
the Word, one part of the function of
which is to keep men&rsquo;s moral perceptions
clear, how many absent themselves
from it entirely! (2.)&nbsp;<i>Seeking
the counsel they ought not to have sought.</i>
They sought counsel of their own inclinations.
It was a foregone conclusion.
They <i>wished</i> to go down into
Egypt. If they consulted, it was, as
often happens, with those inclined in
the same way. Men are secretly
conscious of alienation from God,
which instinctively dislikes His recommendations.
Man&rsquo;s moral nature
is unhinged; and he turns from God
anywhither. The maxims of the
world, the opinions of associates,
considerations of worldly interest,
conspire to the rejection of His counsel.
Micaiah must be imprisoned if
he prophesy evil, although it be true.</p>

<p><b>II. Sin is cumulative and growing.</b></p>

<p>&ldquo;That they may add sin to sin.&rdquo;
Sin is rarely single (H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I., 4507&ndash;4509).
A rope is twined from many threads.
The Jewish people committed one sin
by forsaking the counsel of God,
another in trusting to the help of
Egypt. Some substances have an
affinity for each other. So have moral
elements. Sins have a fearfully attractive
and accumulative power. The
youth wanders from the house of God.
Conscience is stifled. Amusement is
sought. Loose companions are cultivated.
Restraint is gradually thrown
off. Fraud is necessary. Fraud requires
falsehood. One falsehood requires
another. Sin is added to sin.
Soon as a sin is committed it drops
the seed of another, and so onward in
terrible progression. Add grain of
sand to grain until it becomes a mountain.
Money is scraped together by
care and labour, but sins rush to each
other with mutual attraction. If you
could have foreseen the growth of your
own sins, surely you would have refrained.
Count the sins of your life.
They are added up in God&rsquo;s book.</p>

<p><b>III. Every sin contains the germ of
its own punishment.</b></p>

<p>&ldquo;Therefore shall the strength of
Pharaoh be your shame, and the trust
in the shadow of Egypt your confusion.&rdquo;
Sin makes promises which it
fails to perform. You are disappointed.
This is part of the punishment. Punishment
is often appropriate, growing
out of the sin. Sometimes this is
palpable, as in the case of sensual
lusts. Oftener subtle. Punishment
accumulates, as sin does. There is a
treasuring up of wrath (H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I., 4603&ndash;4614).
Will you continue to accumulate
it? or will you pause, cease?
You must repent. Do not hug your
chains. You must cry for mercy. You
must yield. You must repair to the
cross.&mdash;<i>John Rawlinson.</i></p>

<span class="wsnw"><span class="smcap">Quietness.</span><a id="o260_fna1" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#o260_fn1">[1]</a></span></h3>

<p class="bq">xxx.&nbsp;7. <i>Their strength is to sit still.</i></p>

<p>There is a sense in which &ldquo;sitting
still&rdquo; is not our strength, but our
destruction. To sit still in sin and
unbelief is the practice and the ruin
of the unconverted. To such men,
exhortations of a precisely opposite
character must be addressed. There
is a sense too in which there is to be
no &ldquo;sitting still&rdquo; even for the righteous
(Phil. ii.&nbsp;12, 13; 2&nbsp;Pet. i.&nbsp;5&ndash;10;
Heb. iv.&nbsp;11). To understand our
text, we must acquaint ourselves with
the circumstances which gave occasion
to it. The Israelites were under the
special protection and guardianship of
God. Many and great were the deliverances
which He wrought for
them. Yet, when in difficulty and
<span class="pagenum" id="p324">[p.&nbsp;324]</span>
danger, they thought more of man&rsquo;s
arm than of His. Now threatened
by the Assyrians, where did they turn
for help? To Egypt&mdash;to that very
people who had once so cruelly
oppressed their forefathers! To
make sure of having it, they sent to
Egypt large sums of money. It was
in rebuke of such foolish ingratitude
to God that our text was written.
&ldquo;Their strength,&rdquo; said the Lord, &ldquo;is
to sit still,&rdquo;&mdash;to forbear, that is, from
sending off for help to man, and to
&ldquo;sit still&rdquo; quietly at home, relying
on the help of God. This was their
strength, for let them but do this and
then they had a stronger with them
than all that were against them.</p>

<p>To-day the believer in Christ Jesus
is often tempted to a sin very similar
to that of Israel, and to him this
admonition is equally applicable and
important. In a more especial manner
than Israel of old he is hidden under
the shadow of his Lord. And yet <i>he</i>
also is strongly tempted, in more ways
than one, to make flesh his arm, whilst
his heart departeth from the Lord.
He is often tempted thus to do in
reference&mdash;<b>I.&nbsp;To the everlasting salvation
of his soul.</b> Satan tempts him
to look off to other confidences, as
if Christ were insufficient; to look
out for something in himself, which
he may boast of and depend upon.
But in Christ there is everything the
sinner wants (Col. ii.&nbsp;10; 1&nbsp;Cor. i.&nbsp;30).
<b>II.&nbsp;To temporal difficulties and dangers.</b>
The Christian is authorised to use all
proper means for his deliverance. It
would be tempting God, not trusting
Him, to neglect those remedies or
those precautions which He has placed
within our power, and expect to be
delivered by a miracle (H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I., 169,
170). Yet he must, in a sense, &ldquo;sit
still.&rdquo; He must place his whole
dependence on his God, and not on
any plans which his own prudence may
suggest to him; nor must he resort to
any means of safety or deliverance
which would be inconsistent with the
rule of duty laid down for him in
Scripture (H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I., 171&ndash;178). <i>Asa,</i>
2&nbsp;Chron. xiv.&nbsp;11; <i>Jehoshaphat,</i> 2&nbsp;Chron.
xx.&nbsp;12; <i>Hezekiah,</i> 2&nbsp;Chron. xxxii.&nbsp;7, 8.
Let these worthies of old teach us
what a blessed thing it is, in times of
difficulty and of danger, to wait calmly
upon God; using means, indeed, such
as God may put within our reach, yet
not abusing them by making them our
staff. <b>III.&nbsp;To seasons of affliction.</b>
Then it is most eminently true that
the believer&rsquo;s strength is to &ldquo;sit still.&rdquo;
How is he to do so? By submitting
himself patiently and humbly to the
chastening rod without a murmuring
word upon his lips, or a murmuring
thought within his heart; by acknowledging
the faithfulness and wisdom
of the dispensation; and by waiting
the Lord&rsquo;s time for the removal of it.
<i>Job,</i> Job i.&nbsp;21; <i>Eli,</i> 1&nbsp;Sam. iii.&nbsp;18; <i>David,</i>
Ps. xxxix.&nbsp;9. Not to &ldquo;sit still&rdquo; under
the chastening rod will only make
our case the worse; but he who waits
upon God has a way of comfort and
deliverance opened to him (Isa. xli.&nbsp;10,
xxvi.&nbsp;3). <b>IV.&nbsp;To time of provocation.</b>
He is affronted and injured. Shall he
turn himself about to see how he may
revenge himself? No; his strength
is to &ldquo;sit still,&rdquo; to forbear for recompensing
evil with evil, and to
commit his cause patiently and calmly
to his God. David did so in more
instances than one; and the Lord
took up the quarrel of His servant,
avenged him of his adversaries, and
set him up on high above them (Rom.
xii.&nbsp;19&ndash;26).</p>

<p>In regard to all these things we
must &ldquo;sit still&rdquo; in faith, in hope, in
resignation to the blessed will of God.
For the grace that is needed to enable
us to do so, let us have recourse to Him
who can teach us &ldquo;quietness and confidence,&rdquo;
to the Spirit who gives faith
and consolation, who can make the
soul to rest in Christ, and say to all
its troubled feelings, &ldquo;Peace, be still!&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Arthur
Roberts, M.A.: Plain Sermons,
Second Series,</i> vol. i. pp. 31&ndash;39.</p>

<h3 class="tdc" id="o261"><span class="smcap">Dislike to Ministerial Fidelity.</span></h3>

<p class="bq">xxx.&nbsp;9&ndash;11. <i>This is a rebellious people, &amp;c.</i></p>

<p>Many wish to be deceived. They
have made truth their enemy and
shrink from the light, desiring present
relief and peace, even at the expense
of future happiness. Many a man
does not like to be told the truth about
his business or his health. The Jews
did not like to be told the truth about
their national prospects. The incessant
reference of the prophets to the
holiness of God was offensive to them,
and they tried to silence their faithful
monitors. Faithful ministers of Christ
meet with the same reception from
many of their hearers. These cannot
bear to have their consciences roused,
their fears alarmed, and their minds
rendered uneasy.</p>

<p>I. <span class="smcap">The truths which are usually
obnoxious to such persons.</span>
The spirituality and unbending strictness
of the Divine law, the deep depravity
of human nature, the exceeding
sinfulness of man&rsquo;s conduct, the universal
necessity of regeneration, the
inefficacy of works for justification, the
indispensable obligation to a separation
from the world, the holiness of
God, His irreconcilable hatred to all
sin, and His irrevocable purpose to
punish it, and the awfulness and interminableness
of the doom of the
impenitent. Such subjects call up the
enmity of the carnal mind. They distress
those who are wrongfully at ease
in Zion, and they demand that the
preacher shall leave them, and discourse
on more pleasing themes.</p>

<p>II. <span class="smcap">The cause of the dislike of
ministerial fidelity.</span> 1.&nbsp;<i>Unbelief.</i>
Multitudes who admit in gross the
authority of the Bible deny it in detail.
Its unpalatable truths are rejected.
2.&nbsp;<i>The refinements of modern
society and taste.</i> It is allowed that
the curses of a violated law may be
uttered in barns or churches for the
poor, and may fall on the rude ears of
the multitude, but the doctrine and
style of preaching to the congregations
of rank and fashion must be smooth
and soft. 3.&nbsp;<i>Wounded pride.</i> Persons
of outwardly blameless life hate the
doctrine which disturbs their self-complacency,
and revile the man who
attempts to sink them in their own
esteem. 4.&nbsp;<i>Painful forebodings of future
misery.</i> Resolutely cleaving to
their sins, they do not like to be reminded
of the doom to which they
are hastening.</p>

<p>III. <span class="smcap">The characteristics of this
dislike of ministerial fidelity.</span>
1.&nbsp;It is <i>foolish.</i> Is it wise in the victim of
vice to ask the physician to tell him that
he is in good health, and is carrying on
a harmless course of indulgence, &amp;c.,
&amp;c.? No concealment of the situation
of the sinner can alter his condition
in the sight of God or change
the relation in which he stands to eternity.
2.&nbsp;It is <i>sinful.</i> (1.)&nbsp;In its origin. It
springs from a determination to go on
in sin. (2.)&nbsp;In its nature. It is a love
of falsehood, a desire to confound the
distinction between sin and holiness.
Nor is this all; in aiming to suppress
the voice of warning, he acts the part
of that infatuated and cruel wretch
who would bribe the sentinel to be
silent when the foe is about to rush
into the camp, or would seduce the
watchman to be quiet when the fire had
broken out at midnight and was raging
through the city. The attempt to
induce the preacher to utter &ldquo;smooth
things,&rdquo; is an attempt to induce him
to destroy himself and to contribute
to the destruction of them that hear
him. (3.)&nbsp;In its consequences. Notwithstanding
the most faithful warnings,
they are hurried on by it to ruin.
Like infatuated Balaams, they force a
passage to destruction. 3.&nbsp;It is <i>dangerous.</i>
It leads men to close their ears
to what it concerns them especially to
know. It is only by a faithful disclosure
of their situation that they
can escape, but they will not hear it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Application.</span> 1.&nbsp;<i>To ministers.</i> (1.)&nbsp;The
<span class="pagenum" id="p326">[p.&nbsp;326]</span>
guilt of ministers who do not
discharge the duties of their office
with uncompromising fidelity is indescribable.
They are mere pulpit
agents of the devil, receiving the
wages of the sanctuary while they do
his work; keeping all still and quiet
among his slaves, preventing all
attempts to throw off his hateful
yoke by flattering them with the idea
that they are the servants of God.
(2.)&nbsp;The conversion of sinners should
be the chief object of every minister
of Christ. They constitute the
majority of every congregation; they
will soon be beyond the reach of salvation.
(3.)&nbsp;The conversion of the
impenitent must be sought by suitable
means. What may be called the
alarming style of preaching is most
adapted to convert the impenitent.
Not gross and revolting descriptions
of eternal torment; these are offensive
and disgusting, and generally
defeat their purpose, especially when
done in a harsh, unfeeling manner.
But a minister&rsquo;s habitual preaching
should be so discriminating as to leave
no unconverted sinner at a loss with
whom to class himself, whether with
believers or with unbelievers; and it
should not unfrequently contain those
allusions to and descriptions of the
wrath of God which, like the distant
rumblings of the gathering and approaching
storm, should drive men to
the refuge provided by infinite mercy
in the cross of Christ. (4.)&nbsp;It is at our
peril that we soften down the terror
of the Lord to please any man; we
must not shun to declare the whole
counsel of God; we must stand clear
of the blood of the rich as well as of
the poor. Did Paul regard the feelings
of Felix? 2.&nbsp;<i>To professing Christians.</i>
(1.)&nbsp;Many would have the preacher
confine himself to words of comfort,
and object to everything searching and
practical as legal. Upon their principles,
all parts of God&rsquo;s Word but the
promises are unnecessary; they are
useless to believers, for they are above
them by privilege; useless to sinners,
for they are below them in respect to
obligation. What is this but a requesting
that the Holy One of Israel
may cease from before His people?
(2.)&nbsp;Inconsistent professors are likewise
anxious that the preacher should
confine himself to consolatory topics.
Hypocrites! he gives you that which
belongs to you. Consolation would
be to you a deadly poison, a fatal
opiate. (3.)&nbsp;Sometimes even those
who have only the ordinary imperfections
of even the best men wish
to hear less of the alarming parts of
Divine truth. But have you no concern
for the salvation of others? Besides,
who can tell but what you dislike
may be necessary for keeping you
awake? (4.)&nbsp;Let those who cannot
bear to hear the descriptions of future
punishment think with themselves how
they shall be able to endure it.&mdash;<i>John
Angell James, Sermons,</i> ii. 181&ndash;214.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 class="tdc" id="o262"><span class="smcap">Christian</span>
<span class="wsnw"><span class="smcap">Quietness.</span><a id="o262_fna1" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#o262_fn1">[1]</a></span></h3>

<p class="bq">xxx.&nbsp;15. <i>In quietness and in confidence shall be your strength.</i></p>

<p>The principle of our text is, that
&ldquo;strength,&rdquo; safety, success, happiness,
is the fruit of self-control and of reliance
upon God.</p>

<p>I. It requires little observation to
perceive that this is so in outward
things (Eccles. ii.&nbsp;11). Look out upon
life, and see who, in the long run, are
the most successful. Is it the stirring
and excitable, those who are most conspicuous
in its busy competitions? No:
it is for the most part the tranquil and
retiring; those who make no display,
and have the least reliance upon their
own powers. The surest gains and
the most certain advancement usually
attend those who go on quietly and
steadily, without grasping at what is
beyond their reach, or wasting their
energies in unnecessary exertion. The
godly who, when they cannot engage
on fair terms in the rivalry of the
world, keep aloof from it, preserving
peace with men, and exercising faith
<span class="pagenum" id="p327">[p.&nbsp;327]</span>
in God, are provided for, and not unfrequently
even raised to conspicuous
prosperity. In &ldquo;quietness and confidence&rdquo;
in God&rsquo;s providential care &ldquo;is
their strength.&rdquo;</p>

<p>II. Still more important is the application
of this sacred principle to
what goes on in the Christian&rsquo;s soul.
We can further the great work of our
sanctification only by acting upon it.
Excitement and self-dependence can
do nothing. The work which has been
begun by Divine mercy must be carried
out by Divine agency. We are to take
heed not to throw any obstacles in the
way by our rashness or despondency.
If under a feeling of importance of
the work we have to do, we act about
doing it <i>in any way of our own,</i> we only
invite disappointment, and peril the
object we have in view. Only in a
dutiful and patient waiting upon God
can we obtain a blessing. Not all the
will-worship which was ever contrived
by human ingenuity can bring us nearer
heaven.</p>

<p>III. These words should be our guide
in every difficulty and emergency of the
spiritual life. They bid us give place
to no anxiety or alarm. Those who
act upon them cannot be fanatics, nor
will they despair. They will not seek
what God sees fit to deny, nor even to
attain to what is excellent by equivocal
means. No real strength is to be got
by ferment and agitation. We may
not do evil that good may come; we
may not distrust God&rsquo;s power and willingness
to help us; we may not seek
help from Egypt.</p>

<p>IV. These words should be our guide
in view of the changes and excitements
of our times. Because of them many
are filled with unreasonable fears. But
are we to lose our patience and steadfastness
because irreligious speculators
and worldly religionists are in an uproar?
No; let them follow their own
course; let us act upon the principle
of our text. Truth is safe; the Church
is founded upon a Rock; nothing can
harm it, <i>but our attempting to defend it
with carnal weapons.</i> Our weapons are
the Word of God and prayer. In the
use even of <i>them,</i> we must take heed
what spirit we are of, that we use them
not in a worldly or angry spirit. Let
God do His own work. Let us not
venture to step beyond ours. It is not
our work to keep the world in order.
With the eye of our faith fixed upon
Him who with unerring wisdom and
omnipotent might controls all the
changes and developments of human
affairs, let us quietly pursue the duties
which He has assigned us, and we shall
be safe, and strong, and blessed.&mdash;<i>J.&nbsp;G.

<h3 class="tdc" id="o263"><span class="smcap">The Vanity of Earthly Help in Time of Trial, and the Profit of
Patient Waiting.</span></h3>

<p class="bq">xxx.&nbsp;15, 16. <i>For thus saith the Lord God, &amp;c.</i></p>

<p>The history of the Jews a striking
proof of human depravity. That
people at once the most favoured by
God, and the most obstinate in rebellion
against God. Ever hankering
after some new idol, and falling into
some new sin. Burden of the prophets
was to reprove their pride and hardness.
Isaiah no exception. In this
chapter there is a solemn warning, the
last remonstrance previous to Sennacherib
and his army coming upon
them.</p>

<p>First, <i>the insufficiency of all human
dependencies.</i> Chronic failing of the Jews
was dependence on the arm of flesh.
In national difficulties they went to
Egypt for horses, or turned to Assyria
for help, thinking that these would insure
defence. But these devices always
failed. God, from the first, placed
His people in such circumstances that
they could not fail to see that it was
not human might which delivered them.
Illustrate this by the Exodus, Gideon,
David and Goliath. In all this instruction
for us, God is jealous of His honour.
He brings to nought the works
<span class="pagenum" id="p328">[p.&nbsp;328]</span>
of the wise who ignore Him, and
crowns with success the efforts of the
weak and foolish who trust Him.</p>

<p>These words were <i>especially addressed
to the Ancient Church,</i> and consequently
their teaching is for God&rsquo;s people now.
We are too apt to be discouraged when
earthly powers are arrayed against us,
and to be elated when they are for us,
in both cases placing our chief dependence
on them. To do this is to lose
sight of the true dignity and glory of
the Church of God. The Church is
the Spouse of Christ; she is gifted and
dowried by Him; and does not depend
for success upon the State, or any form
of human help. The first preachers of
Christianity were poor and unlearned
men, owing all their success to the
power of the Holy Ghost. We must
rely upon the same force.</p>

<p>God teaches this lesson of dependence
on Himself, not only to the Church
as a whole, but to individual members.
Hence He sends personal affliction,
domestic trials; brings men into circumstances
where human aid is of no
avail. They can do nothing for themselves;
nothing can be done for them.
Trust in God is their only resource.</p>

<p>This leads to the second thought,
<i>the profit of patient waiting on the Lord.</i>
&ldquo;Their strength is to sit still.&rdquo; &ldquo;In
returning and rest shall ye be saved.&rdquo;
In returning from endeavours to obtain
help from earthly sources. God suffers
us to lean on the aid of man that we
may realise its futility. Faith finds
its best exercise in trial; it is also
strengthened and confirmed by affliction.
In such conditions, too, faith
produces its richest and rarest fruit.
Faith must evidence itself by works.
Days of sorrow and chambers of sickness
bear witness to the heroism of the
believer. There are no heroes like
those who suffer calmly and in secret.
Many such will at the last be exalted
higher than even martyrs and confessors.</p>

<p><i>The secret of patient waiting is trust in
God&rsquo;s promises.</i> Our waiting must be on
the Lord. Such waiting disciplines
and chastens us. Evil tempers are subdued.
Attachment to the world is destroyed.
God&rsquo;s Word becomes our
daily bread; His presence as the breath
of our life; and gradually the character
is perfected, and made meet for the
inheritance of the saints in light.&mdash;<i>Rev.
S. Robins, M.A., Dale: Miscellaneous
Sermons,</i> p. 415.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 class="tdc" id="o264"><span class="smcap">Divine Salvation Rejected.</span></h3>

<p class="bq">xxx.&nbsp;15&ndash;17. <i>For thus saith the Lord God, &amp;c.</i></p>

<p>The subject treated is the proposition
to seek help from Egypt against
the Assyrians. Here is the Divine remonstrance.
It illustrates the Gospel,
its treatment, and the retribution that
will follow.</p>

<p>I. <span class="smcap">The gracious assurance.</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;In returning and rest shall ye be
saved, in quietness and confidence
shall be your strength.&rdquo; God was the
defender of His people. Their strength
was to trust in Him. It is so still.
He is the only Saviour. A Divine salvation
is&mdash;1.&nbsp;<i>Needed.</i> As much as when
Sennacherib spread his hosts before
Jerusalem; as much as when the children
of Israel in the wilderness needed
the manna, without which they must
have perished, &amp;c; for man is sinful;
and because sinful helpless. 2.&nbsp;<i>Proclaimed</i>
(Isa. xlv.&nbsp;22; Acts xiii.&nbsp;38, 39).
God pitied the world, and sent His son.
Jesus died and rose again. His death satisfied for sin.
Therefore He is able to save to the
uttermost. And willing. In the ministry
of the gospel He invites every
sinner to come to Him. 3.&nbsp;<i>Conditioned.</i>
&ldquo;Return&mdash;rest.&rdquo; There must be a
complete change from sin; from wrong
confidence to simple faith. Many
examples in the Old Testament show
that believing reliance on God was a
surer way to deliverance than the power
of man. Apostolic preaching points to
faith as the link of connection between
the sinner and the Saviour. The salvation
is by faith, that it may be free.</p>

<p>II. <span class="smcap">The foolish determination.</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="p329">[p.&nbsp;329]</span>
Ver. 16. They had no faith. They
looked to human helpers. It is the tendency
of man. And thus the gospel
is set aside. 1.&nbsp;By <i>negligence.</i> Because
of prevailing unbelief spiritual blessings
are undervalued. Sin is loved. There
is little moral earnestness. Acceptance
of the Gospel is postponed as if it were
some disagreeable duty. 2.&nbsp;By <i>contempt.</i>
The horses on which they said
they would ride point to Egypt as their
strength. It was contempt of God&rsquo;s
help. Thus their fathers had turned
to the golden calf. Thus some turn to
money, some to earthly pleasures, some
to the Church, some to the priest for
salvation. Anywhere rather than to
the Saviour Himself. 3.&nbsp;By <i>self-confidence.</i>
Ceremonies of religion are performed;
prayers offered; obedience
rendered; alms given with a view to
propitiate the Divine favour and obtain
salvation as a debt. It rejects the truth
of the Bible. It proceeds from ungodliness,
pride, and unbelief.</p>

<p>III. <span class="smcap">The dreadful consequence.</span></p>

<p>Ver. 17. All your confidence will
break down. You will be utterly
ruined. It will be as when a great
power collapses. So shall it be with
sinners (Ps. lii.; Jer. xvii.&nbsp;5, 6). So
with sinners who reject the Gospel.
There will be&mdash;1.&nbsp;<i>Complete failure.</i>
You will be left in your original helplessness;
at the mercy of the enemy:
at the mercy of your sins. 2.&nbsp;<i>Signal
punishment.</i> For the criminality is most
aggravated. You will have insulted God
by flinging back His offered hand.
Mark <i>the means</i> by which punishment
will come. By the very things
you have trusted. Mark <i>the manner</i> in
which punishment will come. It will
be utter ruin. Mark <i>the end</i> your
punishment will serve. It will be a
beacon to warn others against your
fate. Instead of trusting in any other
help, fly to Jesus. Believe in Him. He
gives the weary rest. You shall be
saved, now and for ever.&mdash;<i>J. Rawlinson.</i></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 class="tdc" id="o265"><span class="smcap">Waiting, Divine and Human.</span></h3>

<p class="bq">xxx.&nbsp;18. <i>Therefore will the Lord</i>
<span class="wsnw"><i>wait.</i><a id="o264_fna1" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#o264_fn1">[1]</a></span></p>

<p>A promise clear and precious in
itself may gain in force and value
when it is viewed in its surroundings.
The diamond may be sparkling and
brilliant, but we prefer it in its setting.
The rose by itself is lovely, but
we would rather have it with the
green leaves around it. We have an
instance in the first chapter of this
book, where, after exposing the hypocrisy,
formality, and wickedness of the
people in the most withering words,
God suddenly exchanges the stern tone
of threatening for the sweet accents of
mercy, <i>Come now, and let us reason together.</i>
Another example is found in
Matt. xi., where our Lord, after pronouncing
His solemn woes, and asserting
the Divine sovereignty, in the
very next sentence utters His tender
invitation, <i>Come unto Me.</i> The still
small voice of mercy is all the sweeter
and more welcome because of the
thunders by which it is preceded. The
same rapid transition may be observed
in the passage before us. Cast your
eye over the preceding context, and
you find the saddest picture ever
drawn of human perversity. What a
heavy indictment (vers. 9, 10). How
terrible that sentence pronounced
(vers. 13, 14, 17). Is it at once
carried into execution? No. <i>Therefore
will the Lord wait.</i> Wait for
whom&mdash;for the humble, the repentant,
the submissive? No; for the sinful,
the trifling, the scoffing. This mingling
of grace and truth is very
striking. As the play of the lightning
is more brilliant during the darkness
of the night, so God&rsquo;s mercy shines
out more gloriously through the
murky night of man&rsquo;s sin. As the
colours of the rainbow are most vivid
when it rests on some black cloud or
frowning cliff, so heaven&rsquo;s grace is
seen to best advantage on the background
of human guilt.</p>

<p>I. <span class="smcap">God&rsquo;s waiting for man.</span> 1.&nbsp;His
waiting is <i>real and earnest.</i> It is
<span class="pagenum" id="p330">[p.&nbsp;330]</span>
waiting&mdash;it is not a passive loitering;
but carries with it the idea of earnest
expectation and desire. And so while
God waits, He plies you with warm
entreaties and loving invitations, with
stern threatenings and glowing promises;
He seeks to win you by the
shadow as well as the sunshine which
He throws alternately across your
path. &ldquo;<i>God</i> waiting?&rdquo; you ask. Why
does <i>He</i> wait? Can He not subdue
sinners by His power and compel
them to serve His purpose, as the
potter moulds the plastic clay? You
forget that you are a free agent.
Spirit is not matter. God will not
shatter the door closed against Him,
and if He is to enter it must be with
your consent. It is true that the
Lord opens the heart, but a forced
submission would be no submission at
all. God&rsquo;s waiting, then, is real; it
is no figure of speech; and when we
think of it, is He not far greater in
His marvellous patience than in ruling
countless worlds?</p>

<p>2. God waits as a <i>God of grace,</i>
&ldquo;that He may be gracious unto you.&rdquo;
Grace is free, unpurchased favour,
conferred independently of anything
in us, or anything we can do (H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I.,
2303; P.&nbsp;D. 1524).</p>

<p>3. God waits as a <i>God of law.</i> &ldquo;The
Lord is a God of judgment.&rdquo; There
must not only be grace, but truth as
well. God can only forgive sin in
consistency with His justice. In our
ignorance we think of pardon as the
removal of a grudge, the overlooking
of an insult, but this loose view keeps
justice out of sight. Would you
accept a pardon which would degrade
the character of God, represent Him
as a lawless being conniving at the
very sin He forgives, shake the foundations
of His throne, and subvert the
interests of truth and holiness in the
universe? Sin is no such light thing
lightly forgiven. Only through the
sacrifice of Christ can remission of
sin be righteously bestowed. &ldquo;The
Lord is a God of judgment.&rdquo;</p>

<p>4. This waiting is <i>God&rsquo;s highest exaltation.</i>
&ldquo;He will be exalted that
He may have mercy upon you.&rdquo; In
showing mercy to the sinful, God&rsquo;s
glory is made great, and the sin which
is so hateful and deplorable has furnished
occasion for the rich display of
His mercy. War is a great evil, but
where would be the courage of the
soldier, and the heroic deeds which
have been enshrined in song, if there
had been no war? And so, had sin
never existed in the world, we could
never have witnessed those marvellous
exhibitions of God&rsquo;s mercy that fill
us with wonder and praise. Where
sin abounded grace much more
abounded.</p>

<p>II. <span class="smcap">Man waiting for God.</span>
&ldquo;Blessed are all they that wait for
Him.&rdquo; We have seen how He waits
for us to be gracious unto us, to be
exalted in having mercy upon us,
and we should wait in humble faith
to receive these priceless blessings,
bringing our empty vessels that they
may be filled. The <i>blessedness</i> of so
waiting is set forth in numerous passages
of Scripture. What entire satisfaction
and peace do they enjoy who
take this attitude of soul described as
waiting on the Lord! In waiting for
man we are often disappointed and
deceived, but how can we ever exhaust
the Divine mercy and goodness? O
happy soul that waits for God, and
rejoicing in the plenitude of His
goodness sings,</p>

<p class="bqpoemr">
&ldquo;I must have all things and abound<br />
&nbsp;Since God is God to me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>If God had not first waited for us, we
never would have waited for Him.
He took the initiative. Why should
any of us keep God waiting longer?
Are your sins too great? Have you
been proud and rebellious? It is precisely
to such the promise is made.
God is waiting <i>now</i> to be gracious, but
the day of grace will soon be past.&mdash;<i>William Guthrie, M.A.</i></p>

<p class="gap" id="o265A">Amidst the severest threatenings
of Divine punishment of sin we find
assurances of Divine willingness to
exercise mercy. Here is still the
question of the alliance with Egypt.
In the foregoing verses the prophet
<span class="pagenum" id="p331">[p.&nbsp;331]</span>
points out its real weakness and
danger. In the text he assures the
people of the Divine readiness to forgive
and restore if they will return to
God as their true confidence and
defence.</p>

<p>This truth is brought out more fully
when the light of the Gospel is thrown
upon it. Man is sinful. Some
scarcely see this, because they have
never examined the law. Some admit
the truth of universal depravity, but
lose themselves in the crowd. Some
have a sense of sin which causes
anxiety, from which they see no
escape. Others find rest and comfort
on inadequate and delusive grounds.
Now we need not merely peace. That
solicitude is put to rest does not prove
that a man is safe. He may sleep
when his house is burning. He may
have taken what he considered precautionary
measures without informing
himself as to the measures that
were necessary, or even in disregard
of competent advice on the subject.
We should find peace in God&rsquo;s way.
Consider the text in the light of the
Gospel. It is full of encouragement,
but it implies a caution.</p>

<p><b>I. It intimates that there is a provision
on account of which God can
exercise grace.</b> 1.&nbsp;It is not His
arbitrary will which pardons sin without
regard to anything beyond His
own pleasure in the happiness of His
creatures. He considers the whole
race. If He exercise mercy toward
one without an adequate satisfaction,
why not toward all? But this would
amount to condonation of all sin&mdash;would
annihilate the distinction between
the consequences of good and
evil. If God is gracious, it must be in
such a way as that no injustice is
done.</p>

<p>2. Well then, you say, we must reform;
there must be a repentance. And
this is true when properly understood.
But it is not true if it means that God
may be gracious to men on the ground
of their repentance and reformation.
The analogy between an earthly father
and God as a Father is often drawn
so as to overlook the fact that He is
a moral governor, and that public justice
is concerned in His transactions
with men. A father may forgive his
child&rsquo;s offence on his repentance, because
it is a matter purely between
themselves. When the offender repents,
the demands of the case are
met. But an offence against public
law is different. A thief or a
murderer confesses his guilt, professes
repentance and determination never
to repeat his crime; is the law satisfied?
Would any one say he ought
to be forgiven? Now, sin is not only
an offence against God, but against
public law, for which repentance is no
satisfaction (H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I., 4225&ndash;4228).</p>

<p>3. Nor is present obedience a ground
to rest upon for the obliteration of past
sins. The best obedience of the best
fails to satisfy the present. &ldquo;How can
I tell when I have done enough?&rdquo; asked
Dr. Johnson on his dying bed. And
even if you did enough to satisfy the
present demands of the law, how could
that avail for the removal of previous
criminality? Something more satisfactory
than human expedients is required
(H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I., 375, 376).</p>

<p>4. That something is found in the
Gospel, in the gracious provision God
has made for the exercise of mercy
without infringing on the rectitude of
His government. It is in the gift of
His Son. The love of God sent the
Son of God in human flesh to obey
and suffer. On the ground of His vicarious
offering as the atoning sacrifice,
pardon and peace may be obtained.
With it justice is fully satisfied.</p>

<p><b>II. The text intimates that God
is desirous to exercise grace.</b></p>

<p>It is not simply willingness. He
is profoundly desirous of this result.
&ldquo;He wishes all men to be saved.&rdquo;
&ldquo;He is not willing that any should
perish.&rdquo; This truth may be gathered:</p>

<p>1. <i>For His revealed nature.</i> He
does not delight in the infliction of
punishment, even when it is required
by the ends of justice. His tender
love longs to see the sinner avail himself
of the opportunity that is afforded,
and seek the offered grace (Exod.
xxxiv.&nbsp;5&ndash;7).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="p332">[p.&nbsp;332]</span>
2. <i>From the provision of the Gospel.</i>
There was no obligation on Him to
provide this grace. It was His love.
It was provided at a cost that was the
best possible guarantee of sincerity.
Having made such a provision at such
expense, will He be indifferent to the
issue?</p>

<p>3. <i>From the invitations of the Gospel.</i>
The way of salvation is proclaimed as
a royal messenger of grace to all mankind.
It is not a cold statement of
the fact that a channel of grace has
been opened. It is accompanied by
calls and invitations. Will God mock
them by invitations of which He does
not desire their acceptance?</p>

<p>4. From the attitude which He here
represents Himself as having assumed,
He waits for sinners that He may be
gracious. He is like the father of the
prodigal son, who doubtless waited
long and anxiously for the prodigal&rsquo;s
return because he wanted to forgive
him (H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I., 2328&ndash;2340).</p>

<p>And this is the answer to the question,
For what is He waiting? Why
cannot He be gracious at once?</p>

<p><b>III. The text implies that grace can
only be exercised when its conditions
are accepted.</b></p>

<p>Should He bestow it on all? In
their sins? The case stands thus:
God has done His part in providing
mercy; there is a part for man. What
is it? To consent. To confess the
sin with conviction, humility, sorrow.
To accept the mercy by sending up
the believing cry. To surrender to
God as the rebel submits to his prince
and returns to his allegiance (H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I.,
240).</p>

<p>This is what He waits for. When
it occurs He is gracious. And how
long will He wait? Not for ever.
He is in the attitude of one who has
determined to wait a given time, during
which the opportunity is afforded.
&ldquo;Seek ye the Lord <i>while He may be
found.</i>&rdquo; Why should you not? Why
so unwilling?</p>

<p>Let not the love of sin nor deadness
to spiritual things hold you back.
Refusal to seek His grace is determined
resistance of His authority and His love
(H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I., 4247, 4248).&mdash;<i>J. Rawlinson.</i></p>

<div class="footnotes"><h4 class="tdc">FOOTNOTES:</h4>
<div class="footnote" id="o264_fn1"><p><a href="#o264_fna1"><span class="label">[1]</span></a>
In these outlines the Authorised Version
has been followed, but the translations in
which Delitzsch, Kay, and Cheyne substantially
agree is noteworthy and worthy of study.
<i>&ldquo;And therefore</i>&mdash;because your sins require this
chastisement&mdash;<i>the Lord will wait,</i> in resolute
self-withdrawal, looking for the time when
your penitence will permit Him to be again
<i>gracious unto you: and therefore will He be
exalted,</i> in judicial severity (ch. v.&nbsp;16; Ps. xlvi.&nbsp;10),
<i>that</i> (&lsquo;when He seeth thy power is gone,&rsquo;
Deut. xxxii.&nbsp;36) <i>He may have mercy on thee</i>
(Deut. xxx.&nbsp;3).&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Kay.</i></p>

<p><i>&ldquo;And therefore will Jehovah long till He can
be gracious unto you, and therefore will He wait
in stillness [or, be on high] till He can have compassion
upon you, for Jehovah is a God of righteousness;
happy are all those that long for
Him!&rdquo;&mdash;Cheyne.</i></p>

<p>Mr. Birks thus comments: &ldquo;Vers. 18-26.
These verses, from the whole context, refer to
the Assyrian deliverance. The connection is
direct and forcible, though some have thought
it obscure. However severe God&rsquo;s discipline,
its design was gracious. His dealings are full
of wisdom, like our Lord&rsquo;s absence during the
sickness of Lazarus, to make the blessing afterwards
more glorious and Divine. There is,
on His part, no slackness or indifference, but
the calm waiting of an ever-patient love. Even
in the hour of judgment God will be exalted,
not to crush His people with the terrors of His
majesty, but only <i>&lsquo;that He may have mercy&rsquo;</i>
upon them. He knows how to temper their
afflictions, that they may yield the peaceable
fruits of righteousness. Since He waits in
patient love to show the favour at the last,
they also are bound to wait, in faith and
patience, until the blessing shall come.&rdquo;</p></div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 class="tdc" id="o266"><span class="smcap">Waiting for the Lord.</span></h3>

<p class="bq">xxx.&nbsp;18. <i>Blessed are all they that wait for Him.</i></p>

<p><b>I. What is meant by waiting upon
the Lord?</b> Not that sitting still and
biding our time, like a man waiting
for a coach. Not that we are to sit
in quiet, idle supineness, expecting
the Lord to come and fill our souls
with joy and peace, as He used to fill
the tabernacle with His glory. Yet,
because they cannot convert their own
souls, and sanctify their own hearts,
thousands rashly conclude that they
must quietly wait until the Lord work
<span class="pagenum" id="p333">[p.&nbsp;333]</span>
a miracle for them and save them.
The Bible declares our helplessness in
order <i>that we may be stirred up to seek help
from God</i> (Eph. v.&nbsp;14; Phil. ii.&nbsp;12, 13;
2&nbsp;Pet. ii.&nbsp;10). What do we mean
when we engage a servant to wait
upon us? Not that he is to compose
himself to sleep until we signify that
we want him; but that he should
attend upon us, hold himself in readiness
to do our bidding, make himself
acquainted with our rules and conform
to them, and with our wishes, and do
his best to obey them with all readiness,
cheerfulness, and faithfulness.
So when the Lord bids us &ldquo;wait for
Him,&rdquo; He means that we should diligently
seek His face, inquire into His
laws, keep His statutes, and walk in
His ordinances, expecting to receive,
in His own good time, the blessings
which He has promised to those who
&ldquo;wait upon Him.&rdquo;</p>

<p><b>II. How are we to wait for the
Lord?</b> 1.&nbsp;We must wait upon God
<i>with the heart:</i> we must be in earnest.
<i>We</i> have no respect for the attentions
and fair speeches of our fellow-men
when we have reason to believe them
mere idle compliments: will God accept
from us what we have scorn to receive
from one another? (Jer. xiii.&nbsp;13).
2.&nbsp;We must wait <i>entirely</i> upon God,
whether we are in search of peace,
strength or happiness (Ps. lxii.&nbsp;1&ndash;5).
3.&nbsp;We must wait upon the Lord
<i>patiently</i> and <i>perseveringly.</i> He is the
rewarder of all them &ldquo;that <i>diligently</i>
seek Him;&rdquo; but He has never pledged
Himself either to the time when, or
the mode in which, He will answer
our prayers. He may put our sincerity
to the test by keeping us waiting
for some time; but we shall never
wait in vain (Ps. xl.&nbsp;1). Remember
how long Abraham had to wait for
the fulfilment of the promise of a seed;
but in the end, through faith and
<i>patience,</i> he inherited the promise
(Gal. vi.&nbsp;9).&mdash;<i>E. Crow, M.A.: Plain
Sermons,</i> pp. 120&ndash;136.</p>

<p class="gap" id="o266A">Change and uncertainty mark all
things here. The wisest plans often
baffled, the fairest prospects blighted.
But the truths and blessings of the
Gospel are not subject to this law or
uncertainty. God&rsquo;s schemes are never
frustrated; His promises never broken.</p>

<p>I. <span class="smcap">That devout exercise of
mind here commended.</span> &ldquo;Waiting
for God.&rdquo; 1.&nbsp;His people wait <i>in the
exercise of earnest and believing prayer.</i>
They seek Him in the means of His
own appointment; by that sort of
diligent seeking which is opposed to
that of the slothful (Prov. xiii.&nbsp;4).
2.&nbsp;His people wait <i>in holy expectation of
blessings in providence and grace.</i> It is
the patient waiting for the performance
of the promise in the exercise of
faith. It implies a knowledge of God,&mdash;a
confidence in Him,&mdash;a rest in His
promises, as of a child in a father; a
servant in a master (Ps. cxxii.&nbsp;1, 2).
3.&nbsp;<i>They wait for the clearing up of perplexities
in the Divine Government.</i> Oftentimes
in their own history and in
the history of others, God&rsquo;s providence
bears a mysterious and perplexing
aspect. But the believing soul says,
&ldquo;All will come right at last. What
we know not now we shall know hereafter.&rdquo;
(H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I., 4043&ndash;4048).</p>

<p>II. <span class="smcap">The Blessedness of such
Waiting for God.</span> 1.&nbsp;The very
exercise of prayer, faith, and patience
is <i>a culture of the soul.</i> In such culture
there lies &ldquo;Blessedness.&rdquo; 2.&nbsp;Theirs
shall be the <i>blessedness of satisfaction.</i>
Disappointment meets man in every
walk of life, but those who trust in
the Lord&rsquo;s Justice, Wisdom, and
Goodness shall never &ldquo;be ashamed.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Samuel Thodey.</i></p>

<p class="gap" id="o266B">I. God&rsquo;s appearances on account of
His people are sometimes delayed.
1.&nbsp;In answering prayer. 2.&nbsp;In relieving
them in their afflictions. 3.&nbsp;In explaining
Himself in regard to their afflictions.
4.&nbsp;In affording the joys of His
salvation and the comfort of the Holy
Ghost. II.&nbsp;Your duty in the meantime:
it is to wait for Him calmly,
patiently, expectantly. III.&nbsp;The blessedness
that will attend the exercise of
waiting for Him.&mdash;<i>William Jay: Sunday

<p class="bq">xxx.&nbsp;19. <i>He will be very gracious unto thee at the voice of thy cry.</i></p>

<p><b>I. There are persons before me for
whom this gracious assurance is particularly
suitable.</b> It is most comforting&mdash;</p>

<p>1. <i>To all afflicted people.</i> You are
depressed; things have gone amiss;
you do not prosper in business, or you
are sickening in body, or a dear one
lies at home pining away. In your
straits possibly you may be ready to
try some wrong way of helping yourself
out of your difficulties. Yield not
to Satan. There is help in God for
you now. The Lord is not now visiting
you in wrath; there is kindness
in His severity. By yielding yourself
to God, and trusting Him in this your
evil plight, you will obtain deliverance
(ver. 15).</p>

<p>2. <i>To those who are troubled on account
of sin.</i> In order to escape from sin
and punishment, the very first thing
with you is to come back to your God
whom you have offended, since He
alone can pardon you. There must be
a turning of the face in repentance,
and a looking of the eye by faith unto
God in Christ Jesus, or you will die
in your sins (H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I., 1479&ndash;1484).
The natural tendency of your heart,
even when under a sense of sin, will
be to keep from the Lord. Alas! you
will look at your sin again and again
till you are ready to pine away in
despair, but you will not look to Christ
Jesus and be saved. Possibly you
may conclude that there is no hope
for you in better things, and that
therefore you had better enjoy such
pleasures as may be found in sin, and
take your swing while you may. Do
not believe this lie of Satan. There
is hope; you are in the land of mercy
still. You need do nothing to make
the Lord propitious, He is love already;
you need not undergo penance, nor
pass through grievous anguish of
spirit in order to render God more
merciful, for His grace aboundeth.
Therefore we say to you, go to Him
and test Him, for He will be gracious
to the voice of your cry.</p>

<p>3. <i>To backsliders filled with their own
ways,</i> who are alarmed and distressed
at their grievous departures from
God. You may well be grieved, for
you have done much dishonour to the
name of God amongst the ungodly;
you have pierced His saints with many
sorrows. If you were cast off for ever
as a traitor and left to die as a son of
perdition, what could be said but that
you were reaping the fruit of your own
ways? Yet the text rings in your
ears at this time like a clear silver
bell, and its one note is grace. &ldquo;He
will be very gracious unto thee&rdquo; (Jer.
iii.&nbsp;14; H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I., 424).</p>

<p>4. <i>To all believers in Christ who are at
all exercised in heart;</i> and we are all in
that condition at times. Even when
by full assurance we can read our title
clear to-day, we become anxious as to
the morrow. If trials multiply, how
will faith be able to stand? When
the days of weakness arrive, what shall
we do in our old age? Behind all
stands the skeleton form of death.
&ldquo;What shall we do in the swellings
of Jordan?&rdquo; We recollect how we
ran with the footmen in our former
trials, and they wearied us, and we
ask ourselves, &ldquo;How shall we contend
with horsemen?&rdquo; When standing, as
we shall, on the brink of eternity, will
our religion thus prove a reality, or
will our hope dissolve like a dream?
Such questions torment our souls. Let
all such fears vanish. In child-like
confidence come to God, and go no
more from Him. Let this verse smile
on you, and beckon you to your Father&rsquo;s
heart.</p>

<p><b>II. The assurance here given is very
firmly based.</b> It rests&mdash;1.&nbsp;<i>On the plain
promise of God</i> as given in the text,
and in many similar declarations
scattered all over the Scriptures.
2.&nbsp;<i>On the gracious nature of God.</i> It is
His nature to be gracious. Judgment
<span class="pagenum" id="p335">[p.&nbsp;335]</span>
is His strange work, but He delighteth
in mercy. Nothing pleases Him more
than to pass by transgression, iniquity,
and sin when we lie humble and penitent
before Him. 3.&nbsp;<i>On the prevalence
of prayer.</i> This we know, an experience
of eight-and-twenty years has
proved that God heareth prayer;
therefore we say to you, go to Him
and test Him, for He will be gracious
to the voice of your cry.</p>

<p><b>III. The well-confirmed assurance
of the text should be practically accepted
at once.</b> 1.&nbsp;<i>Let us renounce at
once all earth-born confidence.</i> What
is your confidence? Your wealth?
Your strong common-sense? Your
stalwart frame? What are you relying
on? Will it support you in death?
Will it stand you in good stead in
eternity? It will not if it be anything
short of the love of God in
Christ Jesus our Lord. Let us flee
from all creature-confidence as from a
filthy thing, for it is base to the last
degree to be trusting in another creature
and putting that creature into
the place of the Creator. 2.&nbsp;<i>Refuse
despair.</i> 3.&nbsp;<i>Try now the power of prayer
and child-like confidence in God.</i>&mdash;<i>C.&nbsp;H.

<h3 class="tdc" id="o268"><span class="smcap">The Bread of Adversity.</span></h3>

<p class="bq">xxx.&nbsp;20, 21. <i>And though the Lord give you the bread of adversity,</i>
<span class="wsnw"><i>&amp;c.</i><a id="o268_fna1" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#o268_fn1">[1]</a></span></p>

<p>I. <span class="smcap">Difficulties supposed.</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;The Bread of Adversity&rdquo; was a
proverbial expression among the Jews
(1&nbsp;Kings xxii.&nbsp;27; Ps. lxxx.&nbsp;5). The
<i>Lord</i> gives: He who gave the cup of
salvation gives the cup of affliction.
He who gives the bread of life gives
also the bread of adversity (Heb. xii.&nbsp;6).
Recollect that the Lord who gives
you the bread of adversity gave His
own Son no better fare, no richer diet.</p>

<p>II. <span class="smcap">Consolations promised.</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Yet shall not thy teachers be removed,&rdquo;
&amp;c. He will compensate temporal
troubles by spiritual blessings.
Numbers have found that as tribulation
abounded, consolation abounded
by Christ (2&nbsp;Cor. i.&nbsp;5). Such consolations
are threefold. 1.&nbsp;<i>A free access to
God&rsquo;s throne.</i> &ldquo;He will be very gracious
to thee at the voice of thy cry.&rdquo;
Prayer relieves distress. 2.&nbsp;<i>A faithful
administration of God&rsquo;s word and ordinances.</i>
Religious instruction shall be
continued, &ldquo;thy teachers shall not be
removed.&rdquo; 3.&nbsp;<i>A gracious direction of
God&rsquo;s providence.</i></p>

<p>III. <span class="smcap">Instructions suggested.</span></p>

<p>1. <i>Guard against whatever may endanger
Christian privileges.</i> Neglect of
prayer; absence of love; seductions
of the world. 2.&nbsp;<i>Recollect what is
needful to give this promise full effect</i>&mdash;the
influence of the Spirit. Pray for
and expect a baptism of the Holy
Ghost. 3.&nbsp;<i>Commend to others the consolations
you receive.</i> Visit the sick;
remember the widow and the fatherless.
In comforting others, your own
bread of adversity shall be made
sweet.&mdash;<i>Samuel Thodey.</i></p>

<p class="gap" id="o268A">I. <span class="smcap">A calamity anticipated.</span></p>

<p>Affliction may be continuous and
severe. Bread and water are the
prominent things in the sustenance
of life. Day by day reserved. Few,
if any, are entirely exempt from
affliction. Periods of difficulty and
privation, when weeks and months of
consuming anxiety are experienced.
Losses which seriously incommode
and cripple their business. Troubles
in the family, sometimes from the conduct
of those most loved. Bereavements
which rend the heart. Sickness,
accident, consuming disease, and excruciating
pain wear life slowly away.</p>

<p>The godly are not exempted. The
infected atmosphere may poison the
saint as well as the sinner. If a good
man falls over a precipice he will be
killed. &ldquo;The same hurricane may
equally swamp the vessel which is
filled with pirates and that which is
filled by a band of devoted missionaries.&rdquo;
If a Christian neglect his business,
or conduct it on unsound principles,
<span class="pagenum" id="p336">[p.&nbsp;336]</span>
he must expect insolvency. He
may conduct it with perfect commercial
wisdom and care and yet be overtaken
by disasters from causes beyond
his control.</p>

<p>But it does not happen by chance.
There is no such thing as fate. We
recognise the hand of the Lord.
&ldquo;Though <i>the Lord</i> give you the bread
of affliction and the water of adversity.&rdquo;
In this truth is help for believers
perplexed by the mystery of
sorrow. It throws their thoughts on
God. And they have such confidence
in Him that is a resting-place. We
do not know, we never can know, the
evils He prevents. When He permits
or sends trouble we may rest assured
that there is a sufficient reason (Lam.
iii.&nbsp;33).</p>

<p>What are the <span class="wsnw">reasons?<a id="o268_fna2" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#o268_fn2">[2]</a></span>
We may mistake their application, but
they are such as these: 1.&nbsp;It is sometimes
<i>punitive.</i> God has established a
connection between sin and suffering.
The former always works towards the
latter. The chain of connection may
be so subtle, and may extend so far
back, that we cannot follow it. Yet
such a chain there is. When affliction
comes, it is useful to trace the chain,
and ascertain, if we can, wherefore
the Lord is contending with us.
2.&nbsp;It is sometimes <i>corrective.</i> He deals
with us as men deal with their children
(Heb. xii.&nbsp;5&ndash;11). It is not that
He may vent His anger, but recall
them to their better selves. He
means it as the refiner means the fire
into which he casts the gold (Ps. cxix.&nbsp;67).
3.&nbsp;It is sometimes <i>auxiliary.</i>
The means to an end. The dark way
into light. It is necessary to some
advantage which could not be reached
without it. Joseph&rsquo;s slavery and imprisonment
were the steps to his subsequent
greatness. Jesus reached the
crown by the cross. Perhaps you can
illustrate from your own experience.</p>

<p>Meantime, here is</p>

<p>II. <span class="smcap">An antidote promised.</span></p>

<p>Their teachers had been removed.
The prophets were persecuted (verses
9, 10). Jeremiah, Zedekiah, under
Jezebel&rsquo;s persecution. Obadiah had
hid a hundred in caves. Persecution
usually fastens on the teachers as most
prominent. Thus Apostles. Thus the
Nonconforming clergy in England.
Thus the missionaries were driven
from Madagascar. But the promise
here in that they shall regain their
liberty. And this will be not only a
relief to themselves, but an antidote
to the people&rsquo;s calamities. It will
secure: 1.&nbsp;<i>Instruction.</i> &ldquo;Thy teachers.&rdquo;
Truth is the basis of everything in
experience or practice. It is their
business carefully to unfold and apply
the <span class="wsnw">truth.<a id="o268_fna3" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#o268_fn3">[3]</a></span>
2.&nbsp;<i>Consolation.</i> Christian
ordinances are consolatory. There
are truths that bear on troubles. The
views of the Divine character and of
the course of Providence exhibited in
the Gospel sustain and comfort.
3.&nbsp;<i>Direction.</i> There is danger of turning
to right or left. So many allurements,
from ignorance, misguidance, temptation.
By the ministry you hear the
voice which points out the way, invites
steadfastness, warns against divergence.</p>

<p>God provides guidance in the journey
to the better land. Value the
ministry of the Word. Attend it.
Follow its teaching.&mdash;<i>J. Rawlinson.</i></p>

The Authorised Version, upon which
these outlines are founded, is supported by
Mr. Cheyne, who translates: <i>&ldquo;And though the
Lord give you bread in short measure and water
in scant quantity,&rdquo;</i> &amp;c. But Delitzsch, Kay, and
Birks render the first clause: &ldquo;And the Lord
will give you bread in your adversity and water
in your affliction.&rdquo; Mr. Birks adds: &ldquo;These
words form part of a promise, not its limitation.
Here they are assured that, although
besieged, they will not be given over to famine.

The Christian Church requires a teaching
ministry. Not only must the Gospel be
proclaimed to the world, the Church must be
trained into knowledge, experience, holiness,
activity. Individual study of Scripture is
largely useful. But regularly recurring religious
services, of which careful instruction is
a part, are universally necessary. Godly men
must be released from secular business, trained,
set apart to the study and ministry of the
Word. The living voice of the preacher helps,
<span class="pagenum" id="p337">[p.&nbsp;337]</span>
guides, confirms, and gives greater practical
influence to the private reading of Christians.
Even under the old dispensation, large use was
made of this method. There were schools of
the prophets. A few were so eminent that they
have left their words behind them. But there
were many whose names have not survived
their time. Jesus trained His disciples for
their future work. After His Ascension, He
gave various gifts to men for the work of the
ministry. He continues them. While one
could wish that all the Lord&rsquo;s people were
prophets, and that He would put His Spirit
upon them, so that they would work to the full
extent of their ability for the world&rsquo;s salvation,
it remains true that the strength of the Church
is an able, well-instructed, godly, and earnest
ministry.</p>

<p>Among the blessings here promised to the
ancient Church is the restoration of the
silenced teachers to their work after its period
of discipline.&mdash;<i>Rawlinson.</i></p></div>
</div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 class="tdc" id="o269"><span class="smcap">The Guiding Voice.</span></h3>

<p class="bq">xxx.&nbsp;21. <i>And thou shalt hear a voice behind thee, &amp;c.</i></p>

<p>This may be a promise to God&rsquo;s
people of the continuance of the services
of the ministry, or of the additional
blessings of spiritual suggestions
to guide them in the path of duty.</p>

<p>I. It may be continuance of the
promise in the preceding verse: &ldquo;Thy
teachers shall not be removed into a
corner any more, but thine eyes shall
see thy teachers, <i>and</i> thine ears shall
hear a word behind thee.&rdquo; The Word
of God proclaimed by faithful ministers
follows men. Sometimes, as they listen
to it, they reject it, but it pursues them,
and gives them no rest until they obey
it. When they are bent on a wrong
course, it haunts them until they are
recalled to duty. Or it stimulates
them to the performance of duties
they are neglecting or performing
sluggishly. Thus understood, we may
see that in this promise God compares
Himself as it were to a shepherd, who
puts his sheep before him; or to a
schoolmaster who will have his scholars
in sight, that so he may the better
keep them in order.</p>

<p>Thus understood, we see our duty.
It is to give reverent heed to the Word
of God as proclaimed to us by His ministers.
Food, however choice, is no
blessing to us unless it be eaten and
digested; and the Word of God is no
blessing to us, except there be an ear
to hearken to it, a spiritual taste
to relish it, and a heart to close and comply
with it. Well is it with those who
imitate Lydia (Acts xvi.&nbsp;14). But
neglect of God&rsquo;s Word shuts against
us even the throne of grace (Prov.
xxviii.&nbsp;9). To those who disregard what
they know to be the voice of God,
there comes a time when they discover
that the greatest of all calamities is to
have their voice disregarded by Him
(Prov. i.&nbsp;24&ndash;26).</p>

<p>II. But the promise may be that
of an additional blessing, the inward
motions and suggestions of the Holy
Spirit. His voice may be called &ldquo;a
word behind us,&rdquo; because&mdash;1.&nbsp;Of its
secresy (Job iv.&nbsp;12). 2.&nbsp;Because it
follows us always, as constantly as our
shadow. Parallels to this promise we
find in 1&nbsp;John ii.&nbsp;20, 27; John xiv.&nbsp;26,
xvi.&nbsp;13.</p>

<p>III. This voice His people hear when
they are about to wander, or have
wandered from the way of righteousness.
From that way it is easy to depart;
but God loves His people, and
cannot abide to see them miscarry,
and therefore He counsels them. &ldquo;This
is the way, walk ye in it,&rdquo; is sometimes
a word of correction and reformation,
in case of error; sometimes a word of
instruction and direction, in case of
ignorance; sometimes a word of strengthening
and confirmation, in case of
unsettledness.</p>

<p>In all these respects God&rsquo;s people
hear the &ldquo;word behind them,&rdquo; sometimes
giving them very gracious hints
concerning the affairs of this present
life, but more frequently concerning
the spiritual life. Those who wait
upon God shall not lack counsels concerning
the manner in which they are
to serve Him. He answers the prayers
of His people (Ps. xxv.&nbsp;4, 5; lxxxvi.&nbsp;11;
cxliii.&nbsp;8).</p>

<p>What a great comfort and encouragement
<span class="pagenum" id="p338">[p.&nbsp;338]</span>
we have here! If we really
desire to serve God amid all the labyrinths
and uncertainties of this present
life, we shall be safe, for He will
guide us.</p>

<p>IV. But how may we know whether
the word behind us is the voice of
God, and not merely one of our own
fancies, or a suggestion of Satan&rsquo;s?
There are several touchstones by which
every &ldquo;word&rdquo; may and should be
tested. 1.&nbsp;The word within is to be
compared with the Word without. Every
suggestion is to be examined by the
rule of Scripture. God never speaks
in the conscience contrary to what
He speaks there, for He is unchangeable
and cannot contradict Himself
(Isa. viii.&nbsp;20). 2.&nbsp;God&rsquo;s &ldquo;words&rdquo; are
orderly and regular; they keep men
within the compass of their callings, and
the place in which God has set them.
They incite us not to forsake our duty,
but to be faithful in it. 3.&nbsp;They are
ordinarily mild, gentle, seasonable;
they are not ordinarily raptures, but
such as leave a man in a right apprehension
of what he does, and capable
of reflection upon it. 4.&nbsp;They are
discernible also from their effects, and
the ends to which they tend. All the
hints and motions of God&rsquo;s Spirit tend
to make us better, and to carry us
nearer to Himself in one way or
another. Honestly using these tests,
we shall learn promptly and surely to
discern the voice of God&rsquo;s Spirit when
He says to us, &ldquo;This is the way, walk
ye in it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>V. From all this two duties plainly
arise. 1.&nbsp;<i>Thankfulness.</i> A faithful
monitor is a very great advantage; it
is so betwixt man and man, and we
should bless God that He condescends
to be this to us. 2.&nbsp;<i>Obedience.</i> To
His infallible, loving counsel we should
give prompt heed, especially as He not
only points out the way, but is always
ready to help us to walk in it; and
the way in which He would have us go
is the only one that leads to true happiness
and lasting peace. Disobedience
exposes us to manifold dangers, such
as (1.)&nbsp;God&rsquo;s future silence; when His
counsels are repeatedly rejected, He
will cease to speak. What a terrible
calamity (1&nbsp;Sam. xxviii.&nbsp;5). (2.)&nbsp;Those
who hearken not to the voice of God
in them are often given up to Satan,
and their own corruptions bear away
within them (Ps. lxxxi.&nbsp;11, 12).&mdash;<i>Thomas
Horton, D.D.: 100 Select Sermons,</i>
pp. 298&ndash;304.</p>

<p class="gap" id="o269A"><b>I. Our need of the guidance here
promised.</b> We are ignorant of the
way to true happiness, and we have
not always daylight. The path is
narrow, and is sometimes very intricate.
It lies through an enemy&rsquo;s
country. Many as wise as we have
lost their way, and, after years of
sorrow, have perished miserably. We
need this guidance in youth, in manhood,
in old age, even unto death
(P.&nbsp;D., 952, 2388).</p>

<p><b>II. Some of the means by which God
guides His people.</b> The promise in
our text suggests a traveller in doubt
as to the course he should take, pausing
perplexed at cross roads, and in
danger of choosing a wrong one, when
a friendly voice behind him is heard,
saying, &ldquo;This is the way, walk ye in
it.&rdquo; God thus speaks to His people.
1.&nbsp;By His <i>providences.</i> Afflictions are
often monitions and instructions (H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I.,
66&ndash;70). 2.&nbsp;By His <i>Word.</i> It
clearly marks the path to heaven.
3.&nbsp;By our <i>conscience</i> (H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I., 1291, 1304,
1308&ndash;1312). 4.&nbsp;By His <i>Spirit;</i> by
Whom conscience is quickened, our
understanding cleared of delusions,
our attention fixed on the happy career
of the righteous, and the disastrous
end of the wicked.</p>

<p><b>III. What is needed to enable us to
profit by this promise.</b> 1.&nbsp;A prayerful
spirit (ver. 19). 2.&nbsp;A studious
eye that will look for the waymarks,
especially for the footprints of Jesus.
3.&nbsp;A listening ear. 4.&nbsp;An obedient
habit of mind (1&nbsp;Sam. xv.&nbsp;22; P.&nbsp;D.,
1656). Disregard of the Guiding
Voice will involve us in present disaster
and misery, and in eternal woe.
Heedfulness of it will ensure for us
present safety and peace, and eternal
blessedness.&mdash;<i>Samuel Thodey.</i></p>

<p class="bq">xxx.&nbsp;25, 26. <i>And there shall be upon every high mountain, &amp;c.</i></p>

<p>These are symbolic of the blessings
God will confer upon His people when
He returns to them in mercy. These
are vivid presentations of two characteristics
of these blessings, their copiousness
and their universality. 1.&nbsp;To express
their <span class="smcap">copiousness</span> the prophet
speaks not of streams merely, but of
rivers; &ldquo;rivers and streams of water;&rdquo;
and declares that they shall be poured
forth, not merely as the light from the
sun, but as if the light of seven days
were concentrated in <span class="wsnw">one.<a id="o270_fna1" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#o270_fn1">[1]</a></span>
2.&nbsp;To express at once their copiousness and
their <span class="smcap">universality,</span> He declares that
the rivers and streams shall run on
the hills and mountains, yea, upon
<i>every</i> hill and
<span class="wsnw">mountain.<a id="o270_fna2" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#o270_fn2">[2]</a></span> The idea
of universality is involved also in the
future of <span class="wsnw">sunlight.<a id="o270_fna3" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#o270_fn3">[3]</a></span></p>

<p>Have these promises been fulfilled?
Yes. 1.&nbsp;<i>When the Gospel was given to
the world.</i> Its messengers were sent
forth into every land, and it is a small
thing to say that the light it gave was
sevenfold that which the most enlightened
of the heathen had possessed. 2.&nbsp;<i>In
the experience of every believing soul.</i> The
Gospel reaches many who seem utterly
beyond any saving influence; and when
it does really reach a man, is received
into his heart. It gives him a light of
more than sevenfold brightness and
value as compared with the best of
the lights he before professed&mdash;reason
and <span class="wsnw">conscience.<a id="o270_fna4" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#o270_fn4">[4]</a></span>
3.&nbsp;It is fulfilled in our own day <i>by the remarkable increase of
religious knowledge.</i> God&rsquo;s Word is
being carried into every land, and the
children in our daily and Sabbath
schools have a fuller acquaintance with
Scripture than many men and women
of the last generation. There is to be
a yet more complete fulfilment of these
promises in that glorious era of which
we speak as the <span class="wsnw">Millennium.<a id="o270_fna5" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#o270_fn5">[5]</a></span></p>

<p>It rests with ourselves to determine
whether the fulfilment of these promises
shall be to us a <span class="wsnw">blessing.<a id="o270_fna6" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#o270_fn6">[6]</a></span>&mdash;<i>John

We can conceive of nothing more
bright, pervading, and universal than the
light of the sun. At its rising the whole
face of nature is displayed, every object is
brought out to view; the grandest or loveliest
features of the scene are presented to us in all
their extent and magnificence, while the most
delicate tints of the smallest flower are seen
in all their softest shades and richest hues.
Still the glorious object in its full splendour,
the sun itself is too dim, too dull, too feeble
to represent the grace and love of our God;
it must be multiplied sevenfold. And even
then it but indistinctly shadows forth the
unspeakable mercy of the everlasting God.&mdash;<i>Packer.</i></p></div>

<div class="footnote" id="o270_fn2"><p><a href="#o270_fna2"><span class="label">[2]</span></a>
<i>&ldquo;Rivers and streams of waters.&rdquo;</i> But
where is their current? Upon every high
mountain and upon every high hill. Now,
there can be no rivers and streams on the
summit of the mountain range, nor upon the
high hill top. Rivers and streams are fed
from these lofty elevations; they take their
rise amid these towering heights, but they do
not find a channel there. Thus you see that
to typify the effluence of the Holy Spirit, these
flowing waters of the text are described as
being in unusual localities, to intimate that
the blessings will be in such abundance and
profusion as to outrun expectation and surpass
all experience. And this not in some highly
favoured regions only, but the blessing shall
be universal, even upon <i>every</i> high mountain
and upon <i>every</i> high hill.&mdash;<i>Packer.</i></p></div>

<div class="footnote" id="o270_fn3"><p><a href="#o270_fna3"><span class="label">[3]</span></a>
This, like the air, cannot be excluded;
it penetrates the gloomiest caverns, can enter
even through a cranny. So there is no soul
out of reach of the all-pervading Spirit. Those
that are inaccessible to man can be reached,
and enriched, and blessed by the mighty energy
of the Holy Ghost.&mdash;<i>Packer.</i></p></div>

<div class="footnote" id="o270_fn4"><p><a href="#o270_fna4"><span class="label">[4]</span></a>
When we attempt to compare the boasted
light of natural reason with the light which the
Spirit alone can impart, it is not simply that
the former is as the light of the moon, and the
latter as the light of the sun; but the one is as
Egyptian darkness, and the other as the splendour
of the meridian sun, without even one
small fleecy cloud intervening. Jesus Christ
is the light of life (2&nbsp;Cor. iv.&nbsp;6). All that we
can know of God, of His attributes and perfections,
of His plans and purposes, He has
revealed unto us by His Son. To those who
are in Christ all is light, and harmony, and
peace; to those who are without Christ all is
gloom, and confusion, and terror. By faith
in Him we see that all God&rsquo;s dealings wear an
aspect of mercy, love, and wisdom. Corrections
are inflicted for our profit; disappointments
<span class="pagenum" id="p340">[p.&nbsp;340]</span>
are sent to wean us from the unsatisfying,
perishing things of time and sense. Surely,
in this respect, the promise in the text is made
good to the believer; he enjoys sevenfold light
in his soul compared to that which he had in
the days when he knew not the true God and
Jesus Christ, whom He had sent.&mdash;<i>Packer.</i></p></div>

<div class="footnote" id="o270_fn5"><p><a href="#o270_fna5"><span class="label">[5]</span></a>
But these mercies will be preceded by
the convulsions of the moral earthquake. The
very terms in which the promise is couched
convey the idea of trial and suffering. There
is a breach which the Lord binds up, and there
is the stroke of a wound to be healed, implying
previous violence.&mdash;<i>Packer.</i></p></div>

<div class="footnote" id="o270_fn6"><p><a href="#o270_fna6"><span class="label">[6]</span></a>
What shall the universality and copiousness
of the &ldquo;rivers and streams of water&rdquo;
profit us, if we will not drink of them? In
the natural world a man would be nothing
benefited, though the light of the sun was
augmented sevenfold, if he studiously closed
and sealed every opening by which it entered
his dwelling, or if he placed an impervious
bandage tightly over his eyes whenever he
went abroad (John xii.&nbsp;36).&mdash;<i>Packer.</i></p>

<h3 class="tdc" id="o271"><span class="smcap">The Earthly Song and the Heavenly Voice.</span></h3>

<p class="bq">xxx.&nbsp;29&ndash;33. <i>Ye shall have a song&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and the Lord shall cause His glorious voice
to be heard, &amp;c.</i></p>

<p>The fulfilment of this prophecy is
recorded in Isa. xxxvii.&nbsp;36. The Assyrian
power, hitherto unopposed in
its march of conquest, sustained a
severe check when it assailed Jerusalem.
The great deliverance is here
foretold. Inside the walls there would
be song and gladness; outside, swift
destruction. &ldquo;The holy solemnity&rdquo;
was probably the Passover which Hezekiah
and his people observed; and the
&ldquo;song&rdquo; in that case would be the
Paschal Hymn, comprising Ps. cxiii.&ndash;cxviii.
There is a tradition that Sennacherib&rsquo;s
army was destroyed on the
night of the Passover; and thus while
the people were recalling their great
national deliverance, a further and
somewhat similar Divine interposition
was about to be made in their behalf.
Mark how grandly, as if in response to
the songs and gladness of the Passover
night, the voice of Jehovah comes in.
It is impossible not to see the connection
between the two voices. Songs
of praise and gladness have still an
echo in heaven, and call forth a Divine
response to quell the church&rsquo;s foes.
Look, then, at the two voices, the
human and the Divine, in relation to
each other.</p>

<p>1. <i>A voice of confidence on man&rsquo;s part
responded to by a voice of power on God&rsquo;s
part.</i> It showed no small faith in
Hezekiah and his people to observe
the Passover in the circumstances.
How could the little kingdom of Judah
oppose the mighty conqueror? How
could Jerusalem standout against the
assailants encamped in such numbers
around its walls? God was their defence.
To Him in this emergency they
raised their songs of confidence. Nothing
could more appropriately express
their faith than the Passover hymn.
That night reminded them of the rescue
from Egypt, and would inspire them
with confidence in God. They were
on the eve of another great deliverance,
and their song was well fitted to prepare
them for it, containing such passages
as these, Ps. cxv.&nbsp;1&ndash;11, cxviii.&nbsp;6&ndash;13.
Nor was their confidence disappointed.
Without any human help,
God overthrew their besiegers, but it
was the song of faith that called forth
the powerful voice of God. When
faith appeals to God, the appeal is
heard on high (Exod. xiv.&nbsp;13; Ps.
xlvi.&nbsp;10). Two prisoners once prayed
and sang praises to God at midnight.
Their testimony for Christ had been
silenced, but from the dark dungeon
the song of confidence rose to heaven.
&ldquo;And the Lord caused His glorious
voice to be heard,&rdquo; an earthquake
shook the foundations of the prison,
and God gave His two witnesses an
opportunity of bringing the Gospel to
bear upon hardened hearts. Do you
wish to see the arm of the Lord revealed?
then sing your song of faith.
Does the Church in these days sit
powerless, sad, and despairing through
the gloomy night of unbelief and prevailing
ungodliness? Let her know that
<span class="pagenum" id="p341">[p.&nbsp;341]</span>
man&rsquo;s extremity is God&rsquo;s opportunity.
In the darkest night of seeming failure
she has her God-given song, and if only
she can sing it in spite of all that is
black and threatening in her prospects,
&ldquo;the Lord shall cause His glorious
voice to be heard, and shall show the
lighting down of His arm&rdquo; in rebuking
scepticism and indifference, in softening
hard hearts, and in making friends
of foes.</p>

<p>2. <i>A song of gladness and joy in God
responded to by a voice of complacent affection.</i>
All the Jewish feasts were occasions
of gladness, and the Passover
must have been so, when we consider
the event it commemorated, the communion
with God to which it invited,
and the future salvation it foreshadowed.
The Paschal Hymn resounds
with notes of gladness, <i>e.g.,</i> Ps.
cxviii.&nbsp;14, 15, 24. If our song of joy
in God is hearty and sincere, we may
expect a corresponding response. If
we rejoice in God, He will rejoice
over us (Zeph. iii.&nbsp;17; Isa. xxxi.&nbsp;4, 5).</p>

<p>3. <i>A song of self-dedication answered
by a voice of recognition.</i> The song
breathes the spirit of consecration to
God&rsquo;s service (Ps. cxvi.&nbsp;12&ndash;19). Do
we thus consciously and spontaneously
lay ourselves on the altar as living
sacrifices? If we own God, God will
own us. The destruction of Sennacherib&rsquo;s
hosts was a proof to all the
world that God owned Israel as His
peculiar people. You, too, will have
the token of Divine ownership. For
your sake God will rebuke the devourer.
In response to your song of
dedication, &ldquo;the Lord shall cause His
glorious voice to be heard,&rdquo; giving
success to your efforts and enterprises,
blessing you and making you a blessing.</p>

<p>4. <i>A song of security calling forth a
voice of preservation.</i> Within the walls
the people marched in procession &ldquo;to
the mountain of the Lord, to the rock
of Israel.&rdquo; That rock of ages was their
defence. They felt secure in God&rsquo;s
faithful keeping (Ps. cxv.&nbsp;17, 18, cxviii.&nbsp;16&ndash;18).
Have you entered into this
element of the Paschal song? You
shall hear God&rsquo;s protecting voice, and
see the acts of His preserving care.
However strong the foes that muster
against you, they shall not prevail, for
all the Divine resources are engaged
for your support (Col. iii.&nbsp;3).</p>

<p>5. <i>A song of thanksgiving for past
mercies answered by a voice that commanded
new mercies.</i> This element was
very prominent in the Passover observance,
and it enters largely into the
Lord&rsquo;s Supper, called on this account
the Eucharist. How can we remember
Christ without thankfulness and
praise? When He took the bread and
the cup He &ldquo;gave thanks,&rdquo; and He
and His disciples sang the Paschal
Hymn. What strains of high thanksgiving
it contains! It begins with
praise (Ps. cxii.&nbsp;1, 2). It retells the
Exodus (Ps. cxiv.) It rises to grateful
recognition of God&rsquo;s goodness (Ps.
cxvi.&nbsp;7, 8, 17). When such a song
rises from human lips, God will give
fresh occasions for thankfulness.</p>

<p>Let the subject teach us the importance
of sacred song. Prayer and
preaching are Divinely appointed means
of grace and instruction, but we cannot
dispense with song. God fights
for His people, but it is with the accompaniment
of tabrets and harps
(ver. 32).&mdash;<i>William Guthrie, M.A.</i></p>

<h3 class="tdc" id="o272"><span class="smcap">Tophet Ordained of Old.</span></h3>

<p class="bq">xxx.&nbsp;33. <i>For Tophet is ordained of old, &amp;c.</i></p>

<p>Some of us have often admired the
expression, &ldquo;Knowing the terrors of
the Lord, we persuade men;&rdquo; implying
that the law of persuasion should
be the law of the Christian pulpit.
Some would <i>alarm</i> men, some would
bitterly <i>rail,</i> and others <i>thunder</i> at
them; as though the human heart
could never be prevailed upon to
capitulate, but must always be taken
by storm. Paul shows us the more
excellent way. When he proclaims
<span class="pagenum" id="p342">[p.&nbsp;342]</span>
&ldquo;the terrors of the Lord,&rdquo; it is &ldquo;to
persuade men;&rdquo; to persuade them to
escape the ruin and to accept the
remedy. Observe, he does not hide
them, for the truth must be told, sin
must be condemned, the wicked must
be warned.</p>

<p><b>I. Let us examine the local allusion
and literal meaning of this verse.</b>
&ldquo;This allusion to Tophet is the earliest
which appears in the Scriptures. Additional
particulars appear in the history
of Josiah&rsquo;s reformation (2&nbsp;Kings
xxiii.&nbsp;10; Jer. vii.&nbsp;31). The prophet
Isaiah here represents Tophet as
a place prepared for the burning of
the Assyrian king. Made deep and
large, with fire and wood in abundance,
prepared for the king, and he being
thrown into it, the breath of the Lord
kindles it into fearful conflagration.
This is, of course, a figurative description,
Tophet being made the central
point in the figure because it was a
well-known place, a valley just outside
the city, the valley of Hinnom, used
for burning all the offal and filth of
the city of Jerusalem.&rdquo; Isaiah was
commissioned to utter this prophecy
of the overthrow and consuming of
the Assyrian army, in order to inspirit
Hezekiah and the people against the
threatened invasion. &ldquo;Tophet is ordained
of old&rdquo; as that fiery place
which would consume the dead bodies
of these unjust invaders. Hence the
Chaldee paraphrase says, &ldquo;It was
called the valley of the carcases and
of the ashes or of the dead bodies for
this reason, because the dead bodies
of the camp of the Assyrians fell there;&rdquo;
to which Josephus gives testimony
when he relates that the place was
called the Assyrian camp. What force
these recollections would give to our
Lord&rsquo;s threatenings of hell to the Jews
who saw the smoke of this valley
always rising before their eyes (compare
Isa. lxvi.&nbsp;24 with Mark ix.&nbsp;43&ndash;48).</p>

<p><b>II. Note some of those solemn and
awakening truths suggested by this
verse.</b> 1.&nbsp;<i>The same record which provides
for the security of the Church, provides
for the final overthrow of its enemies.</i>
This was the time of Jacob&rsquo;s extremity;
he was saved and his enemies consumed.
2.&nbsp;<i>In the enjoyment of our
highest privileges, we are surrounded by
the most solemn terrors.</i> Tophet lay
not only <i>near,</i> but at the very foot of
Mount Zion. From the heights of
Zion might be seen the smoke, the
fire, and the worm in the valley of
Tophet! A dreadful thought this!
Hell is set full in our view when worshipping
in Zion (1&nbsp;Pet. iv.&nbsp;17, 18).
Bunyan says, &ldquo;So I saw a man may
go by profession to heaven&rsquo;s gate and yet
be cast away.&rdquo; Our Lord (Luke
xiii.&nbsp;25). 3.&nbsp;<i>While no combination of
power can shield the wicked, the believer
has always a source of safety and a song
of joy.</i>&mdash;<i>Samuel Thodey.</i></p>

<h3 class="tdc" id="o273"><span class="smcap">The Only Counsellor.</span></h3>

<p class="bq">xxxi.&nbsp;1&ndash;3. <i>Woe to the rebellious children, &amp;c.</i></p>

<p>These words were spoken by the
prophet at a time when the Jewish
nation was in great and imminent
danger. They were addrest to the
rulers of the nation, who were endeavouring
to ward off the danger: and
their purpose is to rebuke those rulers
for the measures they were taking
with that view, by entering into alliance
with Pharaoh, king of Egypt, in
the hope that he would deliver them
out of it. But we should make a
great mistake if we imagine that there
is nothing in them that concerns our
duty as individuals. God&rsquo;s reproofs
of nations are such as we may all take
home to our hearts, ponder, and learn
from; for they contain principles of
righteousness which, like the sun
which shines at once on half the
world and ourselves, are intended
for the guidance both of nations and
of individuals. Of this truth a striking
example is afforded by our text.
Its object is to rebuke the Jewish
rulers for the line of policy which
<span class="pagenum" id="p343">[p.&nbsp;343]</span>
they were taking with the view of
defending their country from her
enemies. Sennacherib, king of Assyria,
was marching against Judah, with the
intent of conquering it, and reducing
the people to slavery, as Israel had
already been conquered and enslaved
a few years before by Shalmaneser.
The danger was very great. What
was King Hezekiah to do? How was
Judah to stand against Assyria? If
you were to ask any of the politicians
who are wise in the wisdom of this
world, they would all say, there could
be no question about the matter; that
the only way of saving Judah was to
obtain the alliance and aid of some
powerful nation, whose succour might
render her more nearly a match for the
armies of the invader. This is exactly
what the rulers of Judah set about
doing. They entered into an alliance
with the king of Egypt, with the
view of gaining assistance from him,
which might enable them to cope
with Sennacherib in the field. This
is just what a statesman, who plumed
himself on his wisdom in these days,
would do. Yet it is for doing this
very thing that the prophet Isaiah
in the text reproves and denounced
woe against them. Their conduct,
therefore, must have been sinful. Let
us try to discover in what their sin lay.</p>

<p>1. They were making use of human
means <i>alone,</i> to ward off the danger
which threatened. It is not sinful to
use such means; the sin lies in fancying
they can help us without the blessing
of God, and in not seeking <i>that.</i>
This was what Isaiah denounced, and
what we do. When any danger
threatens us, we forthwith take
counsel&mdash;of ourselves, of our friends,
forgetting that all our counsel in the
first instance ought to be taken of
God, by searching His law with the
purpose of discerning what He wills
us to do, and by praying Him to
enlighten our understandings, that we
may be enabled to discern His will.
So too we are ever seeking to cover
ourselves with a covering, to find
some protection or other whereby we
may be preserved from danger: only
the covering we should cover ourselves
with is the covering of the
Spirit of God. We should make Him
our shield and buckler; and then we
need not fear what man can do unto
us.</p>

<p>Our unwillingness to take counsel of
God can only proceed from an evil
heart of <span class="wsnw">unbelief,<a id="o273_fna1" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#o273_fn1">[1]</a></span>
and it is as unwise as it is undutiful. None but
God&rsquo;s counsel is infallible, and only
His covering is sure. But we choose
to have a covering of our own making,
and send up mists and clouds to hide
the covering of God&rsquo;s Spirit from us,
thus &ldquo;adding sin to sin.&rdquo;</p>

<p>2. Observe, the princes of Judah
were not merely taking counsel of
man, instead of God, and covering
with a covering which was not of the
Spirit of God: but the arm they were
trusting to was the arm of Egypt.
Now Egypt had from the first been
the deadly enemy of the Israelites,
and of their God. Egypt was the
source from which all manner of
idolatrous abominations flowed in
upon them: out of Egypt they had
been called; and they were no longer
to hold intercourse with it.
Therefore the prophet goes on to forbid
their seeking help from Egypt,
and to predict that the help of Egypt
would end in their confusion. If we
are guilty of their sin, we shall not
escape their woe. When trials come
upon men to-day, they are apt to
listen to Satan&rsquo;s assurance that in
that particular emergency he can help
them better than God can. They
listen; they sin, and the one sin leads
to other sins; and ere long they are
ruined (H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I., 173&ndash;175).</p>

<p>Still it is woe to those who take
counsel of anything earthly! In times
of difficulty it is of God alone that we
must seek and take counsel. He
alone can give us such counsel as will
never fail us even in this life: and
the wisdom of His counsel, which we
now see only through a glass darkly,
will become brighter than the sun at
noon, when the veil of this world
is drawn away from before it.&mdash;<i>Julius</i>

From that unbelief which loses sight of
and forgets the Ruler and Lawgiver of the
world, and which is prone to worship whatever
dazzles the senses and flatters our carnal nature.
What should we say if a child, in a
time of doubt or danger, would not run to ask
its parents what to do, but were to run away
from its parents and ask a stranger, or were
to ask its own ignorance, or its own whims, or
the ignorance of its playfellows&mdash;yea, were to
ask its toys? Surely such conduct would bespeak
a loveless, undutiful heart and a silliness
such as could only be excused during the
faint early dawn of the mind. So is it a proof
of a loveless, undutiful heart not to seek counsel
of God; nor is such conduct less unwise
than undutiful. For what do we want in a
counsellor except wisdom and foresight&mdash;wisdom
to know the principles and laws of things,
and foresight to discern their consequences?
Now, neither of these faculties can we find in
any earthly counsellor, except in a very low
degree. For, not to speak of the numberless
accidents which warp and bias our own judgments
and those of our fellow-men, and
lead them awry, even at best man&rsquo;s understanding,
unless so far as it is enlightened
from above by a knowledge of heavenly laws,
can only reckon up what is wont to be, without
any insight into what must be; and his
eyes are ever so hoodwinkt by the present
that he cannot even look forward into to-morrow.
Whereas everything that God ordains
must be right and true, and must stand fast
for ever, even after heaven and earth have
past away. He knows what we ought to
do, <i>and He will bear us through in doing it.</i>
Yet we choose rather to be led by the blind
than by the Seeing.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Herein the very
heathens condemn us. For they, though they
know not the true God, yet believed there were
powers in the heavens far wiser and longer-sighted
than man; and so believing, they
acted accordingly. Rightfully distrusting
themselves, they sought to ascertain the will
and purpose of those powers by searching it
out according to the means whereby they imagined
it would be revealed.&mdash;<i>J.&nbsp;C. Hare.</i></p></div>

<h3 class="tdc" id="o274"><span class="smcap">The Spirituality of the Divine Nature.</span></h3>

<p class="bq">xxxi.&nbsp;3. <i>The Egyptians are men, and not God; and their horses flesh,
and not spirit.</i></p>

<p>Among the sins to which the ancient
Israelites were addicted, one of the
most prevailing was a disposition, in
seasons of invasion or calamity, to
place confidence in the power of surrounding
nations, and to seek the
assistance of their sovereigns, instead
of trusting in the living God. Egypt,
being the largest monarchy in their
immediate neighbourhood, was frequently
their refuge in times of distress
and difficulty. Remonstrance
(vers. 1, 2).</p>

<p>In the text an important and infinite
disparity between God and man,
which rendered the Egyptian monarch
infinitely inferior to Him in the qualities
which entitle to confidence and
trust. The spirituality of the Supreme
Being is the contrast.</p>

<p>I. <i>The spirituality of the Deity is intimately
connected with the possession of
that infinite, unlimited power which renders
Him the proper object of entire confidence.</i></p>

<p>There is a prejudice in favour of
matter and against spirit, as if the
former were possessed of greater force
than the latter. It arises from our
mistaking secondary and remote effects
for causes, instead of ascending to
God the supreme cause. Thus we
think of the elements of nature and
of mechanical forces. We have no
power of operating on the objects immediately
around us but by means of
our bodies. But it is mind alone
which is the seat of power. The
power by which all changes are effected
through the instrumentality of
the body resides immediately in the
mind. It is that mysterious principle
called Will. Whatever motions the
mind wills instantly take place. This
is an illustration of the control which
the Deity exercises over the universe.
The Divine Being has only to will the
most important changes and they are
instantly accomplished. It is impossible
to give any account of innumerable
changes continually taking place
in the visible world, without tracing
them up to mind.</p>

<p>II. <i>The spirituality of God stands in
close and intimate connection with His
Invisibility.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="p345">[p.&nbsp;345]</span>
1&nbsp;Tim. vi.&nbsp;15, 16. Were He the
object of sight, He must be limited.
He cannot, therefore, be figured out
by any art or skill of man (Acts xvii.&nbsp;24&ndash;29;
Deut. iv.&nbsp;15; Ex. xx.&nbsp;4, 5).
Hence the great impiety of those who
have attempted to paint and figure out
the persons of the Trinity. The necessary
effect of any attempt to represent
the Deity to the human senses, by pictures
or images, must be to degrade,
to an incalculable degree, our conception
of Him. Hence images of angels,
the Virgin Mary, and saints of inferior
character.</p>

<p>III. <i>The spirituality of God is inseparably
connected with His Immensity and
Omnipresence</i> (Jer. xxiii.&nbsp;23, 24; Ps.
cxxxix.&nbsp;7&ndash;12).</p>

<p>1. It is necessary that matter should
have some figure. But figure is circumscribed
within a certain outline.
To conceive of the Divine Being as
material would involve absurdity.
2.&nbsp;If matter were unlimited there would
be no possibility of motion. 3.&nbsp;If the
Divine Being were material, He would
render impossible the co-existence of
created beings. Two portions of
matter cannot occupy the same space.
But the infinite Spirit is present with
every part of His creation.</p>

<p>IV. <i>The spirituality of God enables His
infinite Wisdom.</i></p>

<p>This seems a necessary property of
that Being who is present to all His
creatures at all times. His infinite
acquaintance with His creatures is a
necessary consequence of His presence.
Every one is as much within His survey
at one moment as at another. We
judge of men&rsquo;s character by their
actions, He by their motives. And
His judgment is always according to
truth.</p>

<p>V. <i>The spirituality of God establishes
an intimate relation between Him and all
His intelligent creatures.</i></p>

<p>Their dependence on Him is absolute;
their subjection to Him constant and
incessant; but in a special manner is
He the Father of spirits. The body
has a tendency to separate us from God,
by the dissimilarity of its nature; the
soul unites us to Him by those principles
and faculties which are congenial
to His own. To estrange ourselves
from God is to be guilty of a most
enormous kind of offence: it is forgetting
our proper parent, the author of
our existence. To love him, to seek
union with Him, is to return to our
proper original.</p>

<p>VI. <i>The spirituality of God renders
Him capable of being the satisfying Portion,
the Supreme Good, of all intelligent
beings.</i></p>

<p>He is the source and spring of all
happiness (Lam. iii.&nbsp;24, 25; Ps. lxxiii.&nbsp;25, 26).
1.&nbsp;That which constitutes
the felicity of the mind must be something
out of it. Whoever retires into
his own mind for happiness will be
miserable. God is qualified to be the
everlasting and inexhaustible spring
of happiness. 2.&nbsp;He who can always
confer happiness on another being
must be superior to that being. To
be the source of happiness is the prerogative
of God. 3.&nbsp;That in which
the happiness of a rational and mental
creature consists, must be congenial to
the nature of that creature. 4.&nbsp;That
which forms the principle of our felicity
must be something that is capable
of communicating itself to us. God, as
He is a Spirit, is capable of communicating
Himself to the spirits of His
rational creatures. These communications
will constitute the felicity of
heaven. Even while they continue on
earth, it is the privilege of the faithful
to enjoy union with the Father of
spirits through His Son.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Improvement.</span> 1.&nbsp;Let us raise ourselves,
in contemplating the Divine
Being, above what is sensible, visible,
and corporeal. 2.&nbsp;Since God is a
Spirit, there must be an everlasting
connection established between Him
and us, on which will depend our destiny
for ever. Hence Jesus Christ has
come. What movements are in your
minds toward this great object?&mdash;<i>Robert Hall: Works,</i>

<h3 class="tdc" id="o275"><span class="smcap">A Call to the Revolted.</span></h3>

<p class="bq">xxxi.&nbsp;6. <i>Turn ye unto Him from whom the children of Israel have deeply revolted.</i></p>

<p>Had mankind adhered to the Divine
idea, no such word as this would have
been necessary. Divine communications
would have consisted probably
of counsels, directions, predictions,
progressive revelations of truth. The
demand that man turn shows that he
has gone astray. All Divine communications
suppose the existence of sin
and the need of salvation. Happily
for us, they show the way in which
salvation may be obtained. The parts
of the human race are as the whole.
The people God distinguished by separating
them from the nations, with
special connection to Himself, followed
the universal tendency to wander from
Him. They forsook His law. When
trouble came, they sought help anywhere.
At the time of this prophecy
they were looking to Egypt instead of
to the Lord. The prophet remonstrates,
and invites them to make a
friend of God against Assyria. The
text may be addressed to sinners now.
Here is&mdash;</p>

<p>I. <span class="smcap">A serious accusation.</span></p>

<p>God was the King of Israel. Departure
from His laws was a national revolt.
Man&rsquo;s revolt from God consists in&mdash;1.&nbsp;<b>Disaffection.</b>
When love to the
sovereign departs, the way is prepared
for any act of hostility circumstances
may favour. The disaffection of man
to God is inbred. From the original
fall man derives a mysterious tendency
to depart from God (H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I., 3390&ndash;3397).
Human nature dislikes the
Divine holiness; dislike of the Divine
holiness is the root from which grow
men&rsquo;s evil deeds. So deep is the revolt
that man has no desire to return.
2.&nbsp;<b>Disobedience.</b> You may say it is
natural to sin, and we cannot be held
responsible for it. Do you judge of,
and deal with your fellow-man in that
way as to their conduct to you? If
they injure, defraud you, do you say
they have a natural inclination to fraud
and wrongdoing, and therefore are not
responsible? When a son who has
been carefully trained develops tendencies
and inclinations to evil, attaches
himself to bad companions, &amp;c., do you
exonerate him from blame because it
is his nature? You say he ought to
have resisted the evil inclinations and
cultivated such as were good. You
are right. But why should there be
a difference when the object of the
wrongdoing is God? The dislike of
God&rsquo;s holiness inherent in human
nature develops itself in the indulgence
of sinful passions and disobedience
to God&rsquo;s commands. Does the
fact that it was your nature free you
from responsibility? Are you not possessed
of reason and conscience? Do
not these constitute responsibility? Is
not the fact that you decline the help
God offers for the subjugation of evil
sufficient to throw on you the entire
blame of your continued revolt?
3.&nbsp;<b>Distrust.</b> A large part of the revolt of
ancient Israel from God consisted in
distrust. When man withdraws his
love from God and abandons himself
to disobedience, he is sure to lose faith.
You will soon cease to trust the friend
whom you persistently wrong and disregard.
Is not this the explanation
of much of the unbelief among men?
They are unhappy in their severance
from God, yet unwilling to return.
Then they expunge from their beliefs
His declarations concerning sin and its
punishment. Truth after truth disappears.
Then He disappears.
They persuade themselves that there
is no need of Him, then that He does
not exist. The wish is father to the
thought. Because the heart and life
have revolted from Him, the intellect
labours to sweep Him out of the world
which He has made.</p>

<p>II. <span class="smcap">An earnest call.</span></p>

<p>1. &ldquo;Turn ye unto Him.&rdquo; From the
folly of the intellect; from the perversity
of the heart; from the disobedience
of the life in which your
revolt has manifested itself. God is.
He is a living person, with all the feelings
<span class="pagenum" id="p347">[p.&nbsp;347]</span>
of one, as well as a supreme
ruler clothed with governmental authority.
He is worth turning to.
2.&nbsp;In the Gospel, He invites you to repent,
to turn. It is a complete change
of your heart and life. You can
examine and reflect upon the truth.
You can consider the righteousness of
His claim. You can consider the
motive that is furnished by His offer
of a free pardon and a full salvation
procured for you by the death of His
Son. 3.&nbsp;Do you feel yourself weak?
He will help you to turn. 4.&nbsp;Turn
from the wrong path to the right one.
(1.)&nbsp;Turn to the trust which He
encourages. Bring your sin and need
to Jesus. (2.)&nbsp;Turn to the obedience
He demands. There must be a complete
surrender. All sin must be relinquished,
even the dearest. Choose
the way of holiness. (3.)&nbsp;Turn to
the love He deserves. It comes
indeed into the heart with submission
and faith. 5.&nbsp;Think of the danger
of continued revolt; of the wrongfulness
of revolt; of the blessedness of
return.&mdash;<i>J. Rawlinson.</i></p>

<h3 class="tdc" id="o276"><span class="smcap">The Fiery Ordeal of the Church.</span></h3>

<p class="bq">xxxi.&nbsp;9. <i>The Lord, whose fire is in Zion, and whose furnace is in Jerusalem.</i></p>

<p>There is a variety of purposes for
which fire is used. One of them was
of old for the sacrifice, the burnt-offering;
another was for incense, to
keep it always smoking. Furnaces
were used by the workers in metals.</p>

<p>I. <span class="smcap">The fire.</span> &ldquo;Whose <i>fire</i> is in
Zion.&rdquo; Without the sacred fire there
would have been no burnt-offering, no
clouds of incense; and therefore God
commanded that it should be kept
ever burning. In this sense, the fire
is the emblem of the life Divine, the
Holy Spirit&rsquo;s work. May it be for
ever burning! Where it burns
strongly, what clouds of incense of
praise and prayer ascend to heaven!</p>

<p>II. <span class="smcap">The furnace.</span> &ldquo;Whose <i>furnace</i>
is in Jerusalem.&rdquo; It is there for
the purpose of accomplishing God&rsquo;s
designs with regard to His people.
A furnace is nothing without fuel,
and the fuel may be of various kinds.
God heats His furnace with different
kinds of fuel&mdash;sometimes with bodily
afflictions, sometimes with losses of
various kinds, sometimes with bereavements,
sometimes with persecutions,
sometimes with all these
combined. Oh, the fast importance
of viewing every trial of a temporal
kind as sent on purpose to constitute
a little fuel for God&rsquo;s furnace! God
is doing three things with His furnace.

is making useful. 1.&nbsp;He is <i>melting.</i>
We are so hard and stubborn, so full
of dross, that nothing less than the
fire will serve (Isa. i.&nbsp;25). 2.&nbsp;He is
<i>manifesting.</i> The fire tests both
<span class="wsnw">us<a id="o276_fna1" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#o276_fn1">[1]</a></span>
and our work (1&nbsp;Cor. iii.&nbsp;13). In
this way God manifests the difference
between His people and the false
professor, and shows who are His
own (Zech. xiii.&nbsp;9). 3.&nbsp;He is <i>making
useful.</i> Take a lesson from the very
vessels you use at table every day;
they would have been of no use at
all, had they not passed through the
fire.</p>

Upon one occasion, like the prophet
Jeremiah, I visited the potter&rsquo;s house. I
admired the ingenuity and the beauty of his
work on the wheels. But after a little while,
I found there was really no reliance to be put
on the results of his labour and ingenuity.
When put into the furnace, some of the vessels
were marred and rendered good for nothing;
they cracked and went to pieces. Did not the
potter shape them aright? Did he not make
them of the same clay? Did he not take the
same pains with them? Then what was the
defect? They would not stand fire.&mdash;<i>Irons.</i></p></div>

<p class="bq">xxxii.&nbsp;2. <i>A man shall be as an hiding place, &amp;c.</i></p>

<p>These figures all coincide in setting
forth one great and blessed truth&mdash;the
truth that <i>in Christ there is suitable and
complete relief under every circumstance
of distress:</i> in distress arising&mdash;1.&nbsp;from
<i>temporal sufferings;</i> 2.&nbsp;from <i>conviction
of sin;</i> 3.&nbsp;from <i>strong temptation;</i>
4.&nbsp;from the <i>near approach of death.</i>&mdash;<i>John

<p class="gap" id="o277B">This prediction, uttered in the days
of Ahaz, had a primary reference to
Hezekiah, and to the relief from
wicked magistrates which would be
experienced in his reign. But its ultimate
reference was to the Lord Jesus
Christ. Here are three separate figures,
very striking to an Eastern ear, which
admit of distinct illustration:&mdash;<b>I.&nbsp;&ldquo;A
hiding-place from the wind and a
covert from the</b>
<span class="wsnw"><b>tempest.&rdquo;</b><a id="o277_fna1" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#o277_fn1">[1]</a></span>
This is but one figure, for the latter clause,
as is common in Eastern poetry, is
only the echo of the former. Jesus is
found to be the best hiding-place and
covert:&mdash;1.&nbsp;From the winds and tempests
of <i>affliction.</i> 2.&nbsp;From the tempest
of <i>an agitated conscience.</i> 3.&nbsp;He is
the only hiding-place for the tempest
of <i>Divine wrath.</i> <b>II.&nbsp;&ldquo;As rivers of
water in a dry place,&rdquo;</b>&mdash;that is, Jesus
conveys satisfaction and refreshment
to those who can find them nowhere
else. He alone satisfies the heart&rsquo;s
thirst&mdash;1.&nbsp;for <i>happiness;</i> 2.&nbsp;for <i>consolation;</i>
3.&nbsp;for <i>reconciliation with God.</i>
<b>III.&nbsp;&ldquo;As the shadow of a great rock in a weary</b>

Such a retreat does our Redeemer afford to those who
are fainting under the labours and discouragements
of this wearisome life
(Isa. 1&ndash;4, Jer. xxxi.&nbsp;25). 1.&nbsp;Let us
thank God for such a Saviour&mdash;the
very Saviour we need. 2.&nbsp;Let us
abide in Him&mdash;we always need Him.&mdash;<i>E. Griffin, D.D.:
Fifty-nine Plain
Practical Sermons,</i> pp. 261&ndash;270.</p>

<p class="gap" id="o277C">1. <i>There underlies this prophecy a very
sad, a very true conception of human
life.</i> The three promises imply three
diverse aspects of man&rsquo;s need and
misery. The &ldquo;covert&rdquo; and the &ldquo;hiding-place&rdquo;
imply tempest and storm
and danger; the &ldquo;rivers of water&rdquo;
imply drought and thirst; the &ldquo;shadow
of a great rock&rdquo; implies lassitude and
languor, fatigue and weariness. Sad
this is, but how true! Do we not
need a &ldquo;covert&rdquo; from the tempests of
adverse circumstances, of temptations,
of God&rsquo;s anger kindled by our sins!</p>

<p>II. <i>There shines through these words a
mysterious hope</i>&mdash;the hope that one of
ourselves shall deliver us from all this
evil in life. &ldquo;A <i>man,</i>&rdquo; &amp;c. Such an
expectation seems to be right in the
teeth of all experience, and far too
high pitched even to be fulfilled. It
appears to demand in him who should
bring it to pass powers which are more
than human, and which must in some
inexplicable way be wide as the range
of humanity and enduring as the succession
of the ages. All experience
seems to teach that no human arm or
heart can be to another soul what these
words promise, and what we need.</p>

<p>III. <i>This mysterious hope is fulfilled
in Jesus Christ.</i> That which seemed
impossible is real. The forebodings
of experience have not fathomed the
powers of Divine Love. There <i>is</i> a
man, our brother, bone of our bone,
and flesh of our flesh, who can be to
all human souls the adequate object
of their perfect trust, the abiding
home of their deepest love, the unfailing
supply for their profoundest wants.
Behind His protection they are safe,
by His grace they are satisfied, beneath
His shelter they have rest.&mdash;<i>A. Maclaren, B.A.:

<p class="gap" id="o277D">I. We have here <span class="smcap">an instrument of</span>
<span class="wsnw"><span class="smcap">consolation.</span><a id="o277_fna3" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#o277_fn3">[3]</a></span>
<b>1.&nbsp;It was an</b>
<span class="pagenum" id="p349">[p.&nbsp;349]</span>
<b>instrument of consolation to those
who first heard it.</b> The prophecy in
which it occurs was given in the time
of Ahaz, when justice was perverted,
and the government, which should
have been for the protection of the
people, was organised for their oppression.
Terrible are the sufferings of
men at such a time, and precious was
the hope which this prophecy held
out of &ldquo;a man&rdquo;&mdash;a ruler&mdash;who should
be a defence and blessing to the poor
of the nation. <b>2.&nbsp;It was an instrument
of consolation to devout men
in all the centuries which intervened
between its utterance and the coming
of Christ.</b> In due time Hezekiah
ascended the throne, and in him this
prophecy had a partial fulfilment.
But he passed away, and Israel needed
such &ldquo;a man&rdquo; as much as ever.
Devout men learned to look for him
in the Messiah for whom they and
their fathers had waited. In the
midst of national and personal humiliation
and sufferings, they were sustained
and cheered by the hope of His advent.
3.&nbsp;In due time He appeared. Whether
in Him this prophecy was completely
or only partially fulfilled, let any
reader of the Gospels testify. <b>And
since the days when Christ went about
Jud&aelig;a, solacing human woes, and
ministering to human necessities, this
declaration has been still more full of
consolation to generation after generation
down to our own day.</b> It has
taught men to whom to flee in their
distresses, and fleeing to Him they
have found that it was with no vain
hope that it had cheered them. When
you think what it has been to men
ever since it was uttered, can you
help looking upon it with love?</p>

<p>II. <span class="smcap">Of this instrument of consolation
all men have need.</span>
There are some portions of Scripture
which have only a limited interest,
because they are for special classes
(<i>e.g.,</i> kings, subjects, parents, children,
&amp;c.); but this is a portion for every
one. The needs of which it speaks
will be felt by all men; and all men,
at some time or other, will long for
the blessings which it promises. Hence&mdash;<b>1.&nbsp;It
should be stored up in the memory of the</b>
<span class="wsnw"><b>young.</b><a id="o277_fna4" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#o277_fn4">[4]</a></span>
<b>2.&nbsp;The aged should count it one of their chief</b>
<span class="wsnw"><b>treasures.</b><a id="o277_fna5" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#o277_fn5">[5]</a></span></p>

<p>III. <span class="smcap">To the present and permanent
value of this instrument of
consolation there are millions of
living witnesses.</span> The declarations
of our text are very beautiful, but the
important question is, Are they <i>true?
Is Christ to His people all that He is here
said to be?</i> 1.&nbsp;Our text says that
<b>Christ is a refuge for His people.</b> &ldquo;As
a hiding-place from the wind, and a
covert from the tempest.&rdquo; Remember
what kind of storms sometimes sweep
across the Eastern deserts. [See outline:
<a href="#o278"><span class="smcap">The Christian&rsquo;s Refuge,</span></a> section
I.] As you have pursued the pilgrimage
of human life, have any such
storms burst upon you?&mdash;the storm
of adversity? of persecution? of an
awakened conscience? of temptations?
The worst storms are those which rage
<i>within</i> a man! In such storms where
did you find shelter? what did you
find Christ to be to <i>you?</i> 2.&nbsp;Our text
says that <b>Christ will satisfy the thirst
of His people.</b> Picture the scene at
Rephidim. To the multitudes who
had almost died of thirst, how welcome
were the streams that burst from the
smitten rock! All men thirst for
<i>happiness;</i> the distressed for <i>consolation,</i>
the penitent for <i>reconciliation with
God.</i> In these respects, has Christ
been to <i>you</i> &ldquo;as rivers of water in a
dry place?&rdquo; 3.&nbsp;Our text says that
<b>Christ will give rest to His</b>
<span class="wsnw"><b>people.</b><a id="o277_fna6" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#o277_fn6">[6]</a></span></p>

<p>IV. Every truth is a call to duty.
<span class="smcap">To what duties does our text call
us?</span> If we have had a personal experience
of the truth of its declarations, it
says&mdash;1.&nbsp;<span class="smcap">Praise God.</span> Would not a
storm-driven traveller give thanks for
&ldquo;a covert,&rdquo; the thirst-consumed for
&ldquo;rivers of water,&rdquo; the faint and weary
for &ldquo;the shadow of a great rock?&rdquo;
Let us remember what Christ has
been to us, and give &ldquo;thanks unto God
for His unspeakable gift!&rdquo; 2.&nbsp;<span class="smcap">Take
courage.</span> Usually as years increase
troubles multiply: but what Christ
has been to you in the past, He will
be in the future&mdash;an all-sufficient
<span class="pagenum" id="p350">[p.&nbsp;350]</span>
Saviour! 3.&nbsp;To those who have not yet
had a personal experience of the truth
of its declarations, my text says, <span class="smcap">Come
to Jesus.</span> Its promises are invitations.
Is not a well of water in itself
an invitation to a thirsty man? You
need all that the text promises; and
in the experience of millions of men
living <i>now,</i> you have abundant evidence
that its promises are worthy of
your trust. Familiarise yourself with
the &ldquo;hiding-place&rdquo; <i>before</i> the tempests
of life burst upon you, that in the day
of storm you may know whither to
flee. Blessed are they who have made
the Man of whom our text speaks their
friend. According to His word (Matt.
xxviii.), He is with them &ldquo;always,&rdquo;
&ldquo;as a hiding-place from the wind, and
a covert from the tempest; as rivers
of water in a dry place, as the shadow
of a great rock in a weary land.&rdquo;</p>

We arose with the sun, and went out
to saddle our dromedaries, when we found to
our great surprise that their heads were buried
in the sand; and it was not possible for us to
draw them out. We called the Bedouins of
the tribe to our aid, who informed us that the
instinct of the camels led them to conceal
their heads thus, in order to escape the simoom;
that their doing so was an infallible presage
of that terrible tempest of the desert, which
would not be long in breaking loose; and that
we could not proceed on the journey without
meeting a certain death. The camels, who
perceive the approach of this fearful storm
two or three hours before it bursts, turn
themselves to the side opposed to the wind,
and dig into the sand. It is impossible to
make them stir from that position either to
eat or drink during the whole tempest, were
it to last for several days. Providence has
endowed them with this instinct of preservation,
which never deceives them. When we
learned with what we were threatened, we
partook the general consternation, and hastened
to take all the precautions which they
pointed out to us. It is not sufficient to put
the horses under shelter; it is requisite also
to cover their heads and stop up their ears,
otherwise they will be suffocated by the whirlwinds
of fine impalpable sand, which the
storm sweeps furiously before it. The men
collect under their tents, block up the crevices
with the greatest care, and provide a supply
of water, which they keep within reach; they
then lie down on the ground, their heads
covered with the mashlas, and thus remain
all the time that the tornado continues.</p>

<p>The camp was thrown into the greatest
bustle, each bent on providing safety for his
cattle, and afterwards withdrawing precipitately
under his tent. We had scarcely got
our beautiful Negde mares under cover ere
the tempest burst. Impetuous blasts of wind
buried clouds of red and burning sand in eddies,
and overthrew all upon whom their fury fell;
or, heaping up hills, they buried all that had
strength to resist being carried away. If, at
this period, any part of the body be exposed,
the flesh is scorched as if a hot iron had
touched it. The water, which was intended
to cool us, began to boil, and the temperature
of the tent exceeded that of a Turkish bath.
The hurricane blew in all its fury for six
hours, and gradually subsided during six more;
an hour longer, and I believe we had all been
stifled. When we ventured to leave the tents,
a frightful spectacle presented itself; five
children, two women, and a man were lying
dead on the still burning sand, and several
Bedouins had their faces blackened and
entirely calcined, as if by a blast from a fiery
furnace. When the wind of the simoom
strikes an unfortunate wretch on the head,
the blood gushes in streams from his mouth
and nostrils, his face swells, becomes black,
and he shortly dies of suffocation.&mdash;<i>Lamartine:
Travels in the East,</i> p. 213.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A hiding-place from <i>the wind,</i> a covert
from <i>the tempest.</i>&rdquo; Soon Red Sea and all were
lost in a sand-storm, which lasted the whole
day. Imagine all distant objects entirely lost
to view,&mdash;the sheets of sand fleeting along the
surface of the desert like streams of water;
tempest of sand, driving in your face like
sleet. Imagine the caravan toiling against
this&mdash;the Bedouins each with his shawl thrown
completely over his head, half of the riders
sitting backwards,&mdash;the camels, meantime,
thus virtually left without guidance, though,
from time to time, throwing their long necks
sideways to avoid the blast, yet moving straight
onwards with a painful sense of duty truly
edifying to behold.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Through the
tempest, this roaring and driving tempest,
which sometimes made me think that this
must be the real meaning of &lsquo;a <i>howling</i> wilderness,&rsquo;
we rode on the whole day.&mdash;<i>Dean
Stanley: Sinai and Palestine,</i> pp. 68, 69.</p></div>

I was reading, a day or two ago, one
of our last books of travels in the wilderness
of the Exodus, in which the writer told how,
after toiling for hours under a scorching sun,
over the hot white marly flat, seeing nothing
but a beetle or two on the way, and finding
no shelter anywhere from the pitiless beating
of the sunshine, the three travellers came at
last to a little Retem bush only a few feet
high, and flung themselves down and tried to
hide at least their heads from those &lsquo;sunbeams
like swords,&rsquo; even beneath its ragged shade.
And my text tells of a great rock, with blue
dimness in its shadow, with haply a fern or
two in the moist places of its crevices, where
there is rest and a man can lie down and be
cool, while all outside is burning sun, and burning
sand, and dancing mirage.&mdash;<i>A. Maclaren.</i></p></div>

When I was at Nuremberg, among the
scenes of interest, I visited the tower where
are preserved some of the instruments of torture
which were used both by the Inquisition
and the Municipality in the Middle Ages. As
one looked at them, the heart grew sick at the
thought of the pain which by means of them
had been inflicted upon countless victims; and
<i>as</i> instruments by which human beings had
been tortured, they were hateful. On the
other hand, when one thinks what this verse
has been to countless human souls, what consolation
and courage it has ministered to those
who were sick at heart in many generations,
it is impossible not to look upon it with love.</p></div>

It is one of a large number of passages
which I like to think of as <i>Scripture&rsquo;s lamps.</i>
Starting at mid-day from a railway terminus,
you wonder to see that the lamps in the carriages
are lighted; but very soon the train plunges
into a tunnel, and you perceive that they were
not lighted a moment too soon. So with
these lamps of Scripture: get them hung up
in your soul at the outset of your journey in
life. Sooner than you think you will find
yourself in some dark tunnel of trial. It will
be too late <i>then</i> to think of furnishing yourself
with them. Blessed are those then in
whom they are brightly shining!</p></div>

It is not to be expected that the young
will fully appreciate it. They have not had
the experience necessary to enable them to do
so. At the outset of a voyage, passengers are
apt to think most about those things in a ship
which are comparatively unimportant&mdash;the
size of their berths, the elegant decorations of
the cabin, &amp;c.; but before it is ended, especially
if the voyage is a stormy one, they come
to think more about the staunchness of the
vessel, the strength of the rigging, the seamanship
of the captain rather than of his
fitness or unfitness for a drawing-room. So
in dealing with the Bible: at the outset of
life, we are apt to give our whole attention to
things <i>comparatively</i> unimportant, such as the
possibility of reconciling the first chapter of
Genesis with the teaching of modern science,
&amp;c.; but, by and by, trouble teaches us to value
the Scriptures as our only sure guide amidst
life&rsquo;s moral perplexities, as our only true comforter
amidst life&rsquo;s sorrows. It is trouble
that teaches us that the promises are &ldquo;precious
promises;&rdquo; and therefore I may fairly
expect that the promise of our text will be
prized by the aged.</p></div>

One day&mdash;one of the most beautiful and
happy days I have ever known&mdash;I and some
friends visited the Valley of Rocks, at Lynton,
in North Devon. We had selected for our
dining-place the shaded side of one of the
largest of the rocks which have made that
valley famous. Just as we were finishing our
repast, an aged gentleman approached us, and
asked to be permitted to share our resting-place.
&ldquo;I should not have intruded upon
you,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but I am very weary.&rdquo; Instantly
my text recurred to my memory, and
I saw somewhat of its power and beauty: &ldquo;As
the shadow of a great rock in a weary land.&rdquo;
In such a land, on such a day, how welcome
is the sight of a great rock! How sweet and
refreshing to rest in its cooling shade! Amid
the toils and troubles of life we often need rest
and refreshment. <i>Have you found them in
Christ?</i> Are the declarations of our text
true?</p></div>

<h3 class="tdc" id="o278"><span class="smcap">The Christian&rsquo;s Refuge.</span></h3>

<p class="tdc">(<i>For Christmas Day.</i>)</p>

<p class="bq">xxxii.&nbsp;2. <i>A man shall be as an hiding place, &amp;c.</i></p>

<p>This is a very remarkable prophecy
and promise, and at first sight most
strikingly at variance with almost
every other declaration of the Word
of God, <i>e.g.,</i> Isa. ii.&nbsp;22; Ps. clxvi.&nbsp;3;
lxii.&nbsp;8, 9; Jer. xvii.&nbsp;5. &ldquo;A <i>man</i> shall
be as an hiding place from the wind!&rdquo;
A poor, weak, helpless mortal, unable
to protect himself from the wind and
tempest, shall <i>he</i> be our refuge? Shall
God&rsquo;s own Word command us to leave
the living Fountain, and betake ourselves
in our necessities to the broken
cisterns of earth? Strange inconsistency,
astonishing contradiction to
every other portion of God&rsquo;s Word?
But who is this Man? He of whom
it is also written (Zech. xiii.&nbsp;7; Phil.
ii.&nbsp;6); and who is thus spoken of by
the Spirit of God Himself, when predicting
the event of this day (Isa. ix.&nbsp;6).
It is the Lord Jesus Christ, then,
who reveals Himself in the words before
us under two striking similitudes;
the first of which regards His people&rsquo;s
safety, and the second their consolations.</p>

<p><b>I. As regards their safety:</b> &ldquo;hiding
place from the wind, covert from the
tempest.&rdquo; Picture to yourself one of
those scenes which Eastern travellers
paint, when they describe the passage
of a caravan across some dreary desert,
where, throughout the long day&rsquo;s
journey, there is no house, no rock,
no tree to afford a moment&rsquo;s shade or
<span class="pagenum" id="p352">[p.&nbsp;352]</span>
shelter. The wind suddenly rises, the
lightning glares, and in the distance
are beheld gigantic columns of sand,
raised and kept together in such
vast masses by the whirlwind that
drives them towards the poor bewildered
travellers, who behold in them
at once their destruction and their
grave. In vain do they attempt to
fly; as vain were all thoughts of resistance.
Before the shortest prayer
is finished, that multitude that was
just now full of life and animation, is
hushed in silence; every heart has
ceased to beat; the simoom of the
desert has passed over them, and the
place they occupied is scarcely to be
distinguished from the surrounding
plain. This is no flight of the imagination,
but a simple statement of a
fact of not unfrequent occurrence. Now
imagine in such a scene with what
feelings these alarmed and flying travellers
would greet &ldquo;a hiding-place&rdquo;
and &ldquo;a covert.&rdquo; If a rock of adamant,
a barrier which neither sand, nor wind,
nor tempest could beat down or overleap,
should suddenly spring up between
them and those swiftly advancing
columns of death, what would be
their feelings of joy, their thoughts of
gratitude, their language of praise!
Who can imagine the heartfelt cry of
thanksgiving to God which would
arise from that vast multitude at so
complete, so merciful, so unhoped-for
a deliverance? With such feelings
should we &ldquo;behold the Man&rdquo; of whom
I speak to-day. We stood in as great
a danger. Our sins had raised a
tempest of the wrath of God, against
which the whole created host of
heaven would in vain have attempted
to erect a barrier. But our Lord has
wrought a deliverance for us as much
needed, as unexpected, as complete.
He has interposed between us and the
mighty &ldquo;wind,&rdquo; the appalling &ldquo;tempest,&rdquo;
which justly threatened our
destruction. Let us who have
found shelter in Christ rejoice in Him,
and be glad this day because of the
quietness we enjoy. Let those who
are still outside the great &ldquo;Hiding-Place,&rdquo;
the wondrous &ldquo;Covert&rdquo; which
God&rsquo;s mercy has provided, remember
that an unapplied Saviour is no
Saviour. Their peril has been in no
sense lessened by His advent. In the
gladness of this day they can have no
share.</p>

<p><b>II. His people&rsquo;s consolation.</b> &ldquo;As
rivers of water in a dry place, as the
shadow of a great rock in a weary
land.&rdquo; Before we had symbols of
<i>safety;</i> here we have symbols of <i>consolation.</i>
1.&nbsp;<i>God&rsquo;s people often feel that
this world is a dry and barren place
and thirst for consolation and succour.</i>
That which they thirst for, they may
find in Christ. He is not merely a
river, but (so abundant are His consolations)
&ldquo;rivers of water&rdquo; to them
that are fainting under the trials,
anxieties, or distresses of the world.
But it is not enough that the river is
running at your feet; you must know
it is there, you must drink of its
waters, or they will not assuage your
thirst. In Hagar sitting down in utter
hopelessness and helplessness, when
near her there was an abundant supply
of water for herself and her child
(Gen. xxi.&nbsp;15&ndash;19), we have an emblem
of too many distressed and sorrowful
Christians. &ldquo;<i>Rivers</i> of water&rdquo; are
flowing past you: arise, and drink!
(Rev. xxii.&nbsp;17). 2.&nbsp;<i>God&rsquo;s people are
often faint and weary as they pursue their
earthly pilgrimage.</i> But during every
stage of it they may &ldquo;renew their
strength,&rdquo; and so be enabled to persevere
until at length &ldquo;they stand in
Zion before God,&rdquo; for Christ is &ldquo;as the
shadow of a great rock in a weary
land.&rdquo; Don&rsquo;t be satisfied with just
coming <i>within the range of the shadow</i> of
the Rock; there are in the Rock
recesses where you may find a complete
shelter and a sweeter rest. Enter
into them. Cultivate a closer fellowship
with Christ. So in every stage
of your journey you shall have not
only strength, but joy (Isaiah xxxv.&nbsp;10).&mdash;<i>H. Blunt, A.M.:
Posthumous Sermons,</i> pp. 23&ndash;42.</p>

<p class="gap" id="o278A">The &ldquo;Man&rdquo; here referred to is the
Divine Redeemer&mdash;the one theme of
the Bible. &ldquo;Hiding-place&rdquo; and
<span class="pagenum" id="p353">[p.&nbsp;353]</span>
&ldquo;covert&rdquo; express substantially the
same idea&mdash;shelter, defence, safety,
deliverance from both actual and impending
evil. Jesus Christ in this
broad and comprehensive sense is the
Refuge of His people. Fleeing to Him,
men find protection, &amp;c.</p>

<p><b>I. Christ is a refuge in the day of
earthly disappointment.</b> Human life
full of disappointments. Few of our
anticipations of good realised. Our
fondest and most sacredly cherished
hopes blighted. The world deceives
men: it is not what it seems to be, it
does not satisfy the desires it awakens.
The god of this world is the master
spirit of lying and deception, and he
so manages the shifting scenes as to
keep up the deception until the last.
So with (<i>a</i>)&nbsp;the man of business,
(<i>b</i>)&nbsp;those who aspire to earthly honour,
fame, power, (<i>c</i>)&nbsp;the student, (<i>d</i>)&nbsp;the
pleasure-seeker. To these children of
disappointment, Christ is a refuge; He
has Himself felt the ills of life (Heb.
iv.&nbsp;15, 16). There is a &ldquo;hiding-place&rdquo;
where the fury of life&rsquo;s storms never
comes; the God of mercy offers eternal
life in the Gospel. Forsaken, disheartened,
disappointed men may still
be accepted of Christ, and find peace
and rest in Him.</p>

<p><b>II. Christ is a Refuge in time of
affliction.</b> This is a world of sorrow
and suffering; men turn from it in disgust
and anguish to seek relief elsewhere,
or to weep life away in sadness
and darkness. Now Christ alone is
available in just such an hour. When
the world turns its back upon us, there
is a Friend who sticketh closer than a
brother&mdash;one born for adversity&mdash;a
shield and a deliverer in the day of
affliction. We may not be able to explain
the philosophy of the thing, but
the soul that looks to Christ is so sustained
as to rejoice in the tribulation, and
the heaviest burden is lightened and
made a blessing.</p>

<p><b>III. Christ is a Refuge in the day
of trial.</b> It pleases the Lord to make
full proof of His people. He puts their
love, fidelity, and integrity to the test.
God tries (<i>a</i>)&nbsp;our faith, (<i>b</i>)&nbsp;hope,
(<i>c</i>)&nbsp;patience, (<i>d</i>)&nbsp;principles. And in His
day of fiery trial our only safety is in
the &ldquo;hiding-place&rdquo; of Divine mercy&mdash;we
need the &ldquo;covert&rdquo; of the Almighty
wings. None but Christ is
able to give the soul confidence in
such days and hours.</p>

<p><b>IV. Christ is a Refuge in the day
of fear.</b> Sin is darkness, and hence
wherever there is sin there is gloom
and fear. The wicked man is a slave
to fear, and even the Christian at
times suffers greatly because of it.
The remedy for this gloomy experience
is in Christ; and there is a power in
the Gospel to lift the soul into a region
of perpetual sunshine. In Christian
experience, peace, joy, and hope are
the ministering angels (Hab. iii.&nbsp;17, 18).</p>

<p><b>V. Christ is a Refuge from the torments
of an accusing conscience.</b> The
day of self-convicted guilt always a
day of memorable experiences. Conscience
upbraids, justice demands satisfaction;
the soul is ready to sink into
hell. Whose arm can save you in such an
hour? where shall he seek refuge?
in that hour none but Christ can
save.</p>

<p><b>VI. Christ is a Refuge in the day
of final wrath.</b> The wrath to come&mdash;the
just, final, and eternal wrath of
God&mdash;a reality, a fixed fact in thought
and experience. Jesus Christ is a
refuge from this impending evil. The
Cross lifted up on Calvary has received
the thunder; God and the believer in
Jesus Christ are reconciled. What,
then, have they to fear whose life is
hid in Christ? Death cannot harm,
the judgment-day need not terrify.</p>

<p>Glorious Refuge! it never fails&mdash;is
never shut against the penitent soul&mdash;has
never been shaken&mdash;and will yet
resist the fire and deluge of the great
day of wrath. This is the Ark, and they
are eternally safe who are therein.&mdash;<i>J.&nbsp;M.

<h3 class="tdc" id="o279"><span class="smcap">Rivers of Water in a Dry Place.</span></h3>

<p class="bq">xxxii.&nbsp;2. <i>As rivers of water in a dry place.</i></p>

<p>The surface sense of this passage
may refer to Hezekiah and to other
good kings who were a means of great
blessing to the declining kingdom of
Judah; but its declarations are too full
of meaning to be applied solely or
primarily to any mere man. They are
never fully understood until they are
applied to Christ, the true King of
righteousness, who confers the highest
blessings upon His people. In Him
there is a fulness and variety of blessing
such as the varied metaphors of
this passage fail to set forth. He is
the true Man of whom Isaiah speaks;
the man in whom the fulness of the
Godhead dwells bodily, and who therefore
can be, and is, &ldquo;as rivers of water
in a dry place.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I. <span class="smcap">The Metaphor.</span> This implies,
1.&nbsp;Great <i>excellence</i> of blessing. How
valuable is a river to the land through
which it flows! So Christ is the source
and the sustenance of the fertility,
fruitfulness, and beauty of His people.
2.&nbsp;<i>Abundance</i> of blessing. Think of
the vast floods that flow through the
Amazon, the Ganges, the Indus, the
Orinoco. So in Christ there is grace
sufficient for all mankind. 3.&nbsp;<i>Freshness</i>
of <span class="wsnw">blessing.<a id="o279_fna1" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#o279_fn1">[1]</a></span>
4.&nbsp;<i>Freeness</i> of
blessing. Though individuals may
claim peculiar rights in rivers, all
creatures drink of them freely, the dog
as well as the swan. So may all, however
vile, partake of the grace that is
in Christ. 5.&nbsp;<i>Constancy</i> of blessing.
Pools and cisterns dry up, but the
river goes on for ever. So it is with
Jesus; the grace to pardon and the
power to heal are not spasmodic
powers in Him, they abide in Him
unabated for evermore.</p>

<p>II. <span class="smcap">A Special Excellence</span> which
the text mentions. &ldquo;Rivers of water
<i>in a dry place.</i>&rdquo; Only the residents in
a tropical country can fully appreciate
that phrase. But Christ came to such
a place when He came to our race. So
He does when with His salvation He
visits the individual soul. Were it not
for Him, the souls, even of His people
under the influence of wealth or of
poverty, of the cares or of the pleasures
of life, would be always dry. But He
refreshes, sustains, and fertilises those
who otherwise would utterly faint and
fail.</p>

<p>III. <span class="smcap">Practical Lessons.</span> 1.&nbsp;<i>See
the goings out of God&rsquo;s heart to man, and
man&rsquo;s way of communing with God.</i>
God&rsquo;s heart is an infinite ocean of
goodness, and it flows forth to us
through Jesus Christ, not in streams
and driblets, but in rivers of grace
and mercy. These streams we cannot
purchase or merit, we have only to
receive them; when we drink of the
stream, we partake of God. 2.&nbsp;<i>See
what a misery it is that men should be
perishing and dying of soul thirst when
there are these rivers so near.</i> Some have
never heard of them; therefore help to
the utmost the Missionary Society.
Others who have heard of them are
smitten with a strange insanity that
leads them to turn away from them.
3.&nbsp;<i>Let us learn where, if we are suffering
from spiritual drought and barrenness,
the blame lies.</i> It cannot lie in Christ.
4.&nbsp;<i>If Christ is ready to be to us as rivers,</i>
drink of Him, all of <span class="wsnw">you.<a id="o279_fna2" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#o279_fn2">[2]</a></span>
Live near Him. Live in
<span class="wnsw">Him.<a id="o279_fna3" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#o279_fn3">[3]</a></span>&mdash;<i>C.&nbsp;H.
Spurgeon: Metropolitan Tabernacle Pulpit,</i>
No. 1243.</p>

<div class="footnotes"><h4 class="tdc">FOOTNOTES:</h4>
<div class="footnote" id="o279_fn1"><p><a href="#o279_fna1"><span class="label">[1]</span></a>
In a river we see not only excellence
and abundance, but <i>freshness.</i> A pool is the
same thing over again, and gradually it becomes
a stagnant pond, breeding corrupt life
and pestilential gases. A river is always the
same, yet never the same; it is ever in its
place, yet always moving on. Filled to the
brim with living water, even as in ages long
gone by, and yet flowing fresh from the spring,
it is an ancient novelty. We call our own
beautiful river, &ldquo;Father Thames,&rdquo; yet he
wears no furrows on his brows, but leaps in
all the freshness of youth. You shall live by
the banks of a river for years, and yet each
morning its stream shall be as fresh as though
its fountain had been unsealed but an hour
ago when the birds began to awake the morning
and the sun to sip the dews. Is it not so
with our Lord Jesus Christ? Is He not evermore
as bright and fresh as when first you met
with Him?&mdash;<i>Spurgeon.</i></p></div>

<div class="footnote" id="o279_fn2"><p><a href="#o279_fna2"><span class="label">[2]</span></a>
Is Christ a river? then <i>drink of Him,</i> all
of you. To be carried along on the surface
<span class="pagenum" id="p355">[p.&nbsp;355]</span>
of Christianity, like a man in a boat, is not
enough, you must drink or die. Many are
influenced by the externals of religion, but
Christ is not in them; they are on the water,
but the water is not in them; and if they continue
as they are they will be lost. A man
may be in a boat on a river and yet die of
thirst if he refuses to drink; and so you may
be carried along and excited by a revival,
but unless you receive the Lord Jesus into
your soul by faith, you will perish after all.&mdash;<i>Spurgeon.</i></p></div>

<div class="footnote" id="o279_fn3"><p><a href="#o279_fna3"><span class="label">[3]</span></a>
If Christ be like a river, let us be like the
fishes, <i>live in it.</i> The fish is an ancient Christian
emblem for Jesus and His people. I sat
under a beech-tree some months ago in the
New Forest; I gazed up into it, measured it,
and marked the architecture of its branches,
but suddenly I saw a little squirrel leap from
bough to bough, and I thought, &ldquo;After all,
this beech-tree is far more to you than me,
for you live in it. It delights me, it instructs
me, and it affords me shade, but you live in it
and upon it.&rdquo; So we know something about
rivers, and they are very useful to us, but to
the fish the river is its element, its life, its all.
So, my brethren, let us not merely read about
Christ, and think of Him, and speak of Him,
but let us live on Him, and in Him, as the
squirrel in the tree and the fish in the river.
Live <i>by</i> Him, and live <i>for</i> Him: you will do
both if you live <i>in</i> Him.&mdash;<i>Spurgeon.</i></p>

<h3 class="tdc" id="o280"><span class="smcap">Comfort in Christ.</span></h3>

<p class="bq">xxxii.&nbsp;2. <i>As the shadow of a great rock in a weary land.</i></p>

<p>This chapter begins with a prophecy
of the Messiah, and of the happiness
which the godly should enjoy under
His reign (ver. 1). True as well as
beautiful are its descriptions of Christ.</p>

<p><b>I. To the children of God this world
is often &ldquo;a weary land.&rdquo;</b> 1.&nbsp;<i>Because
of the labours they have to undergo.</i> This
is a laborious world (Eccles. i.&nbsp;8). Employment
is in itself a blessing; it was
provided for man in Eden; but every
day the sun sets upon millions who
are faint and weary, who are overwrought,
and for whom there will be
no sufficient rest until they lie down
in the grave. To God&rsquo;s children it
is a special cause of weariness that
they are compelled to devote so much
time in labouring for &ldquo;the meat which
perisheth,&rdquo; and that they have so little
time for meditation and for communion
with God. 2.&nbsp;<i>Because of the troubles
to which they are exposed</i> (Job v.&nbsp;7).
Troubles attend every stage and condition
of life. They are national, domestic,
personal. The pains and evils
of life commonly increase as its length
is protracted. And there is nothing
more wearisome than troubles. Many
who can endure labour cannot endure
trouble. This makes the heart stoop,
and weakens the mind as well as the
body. A troublesome world must be a
wearisome world. 3.&nbsp;<i>Because of the perplexities
by which they are harassed.</i> This
is a dark world. What is past, what
is present, as well as what is to come,
lies involved in darkness. Life is full
of mystery. Strange and unexpected
events are constantly happening,
which disappoint the hopes and frustrate
the designs of the wisest. Providence
often baffles the interpretation
and tries the faith even of the most
devout. Wickedness is often triumphant,
and virtue trampled under foot.
Good men are often tired of living in a
world which subjects them to continual
anxiety and suspense. 4.&nbsp;<i>Because of
the sin by which they are surrounded.</i>
The moral atmosphere in which they
live is uncongenial. The practices and
principles with which they are daily
brought into contact fill them with
disgust, with indignation, and with
grief (2&nbsp;Pet. ii.&nbsp;7, 8; Ps. cxix.&nbsp;139,
156, 158; Acts xvii.&nbsp;16; Ezek. ix.&nbsp;4).</p>

<p><b>II. Whensoever God&rsquo;s children are
weary of the world, they may find
comfort in Christ.</b> They may always
find comfort. 1.&nbsp;<i>In the compassion of
Christ.</i> He knows what it is to be
faint and weary. He knows the heart
of a pilgrim and stranger. And He
has the tenderest compassion for His
friends in distress or want. He is as
pitiful to-day as He was when He
tabernacled on earth. He feels all
that His followers feel (Acts ix.&nbsp;2;
Heb. iv.&nbsp;14&ndash;16). 2.&nbsp;<i>In the intercession
of Christ.</i> As He prayed for Peter
(Luke xii.&nbsp;32) and for all His disciples
before His crucifixion (John xvii.), so
He still makes intercession for His
<span class="pagenum" id="p356">[p.&nbsp;356]</span>
followers according to their necessities.
And His intercession is always prevalent
(John xi.&nbsp;42). 3.&nbsp;<i>In the strength
of Christ.</i> Weakness is the cause of
weariness, and the weary may always
find the strength they want in Christ
(Phil. iv.&nbsp;13; 2&nbsp;Cor. xii.&nbsp;7&ndash;10).
4.&nbsp;<i>In the government of Christ.</i> He has promised
to give them peace even in this
world (John xiv.&nbsp;27; xvi.&nbsp;33; xiv.&nbsp;2, 3).
These are great and precious promises,
because they are sure promises.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Application.</span>&mdash;Since the friends of
Christ, when they are weary of the
world, may always find comfort in
Him&mdash;1.&nbsp;<i>They should not regard the
things which make them weary of it as
curses but as blessings.</i> It is a good
thing to have our hold of the world
loosened. It is a good thing to be
driven to Christ. All their trials and
sufferings are suited to prepare them
to enjoy more peace and rest in Christ,
than they could otherwise enjoy.
When a man finds a covert in a great
storm, he finds more pleasure in it
than he does on a fine fair day. So
Christians enjoy more real satisfaction
and happiness in adversity than in
prosperity, because while prosperity
leads them to the enjoyment of the
world, adversity leads to the enjoyment
of Christ. 2.&nbsp;<i>They enjoy more
happiness even in this life than sinners do.</i>
Sinners often seem happier than saints,
but theirs is a loud and transient
mirth, whereas God&rsquo;s people have a
deep and lasting joy. Autumn is
oftener a pleasanter season than spring,
but it deepens into the gloom and
vigour of winter; whereas after the
storms of March and the rain of April
come the bright joyous days of summer.
The life of the sinner is at best an
autumn life, with autumn prospects,
but the life of God&rsquo;s children is a
spring life. And even here and now
they (and they only) are filled with
that peace of God which passeth all
understanding, affords joy in sorrow,
and gives rest to the weary. 3.&nbsp;<i>They
ought never to be heard murmuring or
complaining under any troubles or afflictions
in which they may be involved.</i>
This world is full of murmuring; and
when God&rsquo;s people complain, it is
highly offensive to God (Ps. cvi.&nbsp;25, 26).
But why should they complain?
(Heb. xii.&nbsp;11). And they have
a present refuge, even Christ, in whom
they may find &ldquo;strong consolation.&rdquo;
4.&nbsp;<i>They ought never to be found depressed
with anxiety as to the future</i> (Phil.
iv.&nbsp;6, 7).&mdash;<i>Dr. Emmons: Works,</i> vol.
iii. 352&ndash;365.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 class="tdc" id="o281"><span class="smcap">Christian Liberality.</span></h3>

<p class="bq">xxxii.&nbsp;8. <i>But the liberal deviseth liberal things; and by liberal things shall
he stand.</i></p>

<p>This prophecy relates to the time
when the kingdom of Judah would
relinquish its foolish dependence on
Egypt. The king would reign in
righteousness. Men and things would
be called by their true names. Selfish
injustice to the poor would contrast
with considerate helpfulness. When
generosity begins to be exercised on a
large scale, the standard is raised.
The raising of the standard tends to
the general enlargement of the scale
of benevolence.</p>

<p>Our subject is Christian liberality.</p>

<p>I. <span class="smcap">The qualities by which it is
distinguished.</span></p>

<p>1. <i>Sympathy.</i> It is the opposite of
the disposition to act on the assumption
that a man&rsquo;s own interest and
happiness is the main end of his existence.
It is the disposition that looks
out to others, imagines their case, feels
for them, desires their happiness.
Difference of race, nationality, church,
opinion sinks to nothing in its presence.
It asks, What is the need?
<span class="pagenum" id="p357">[p.&nbsp;357]</span>
Neither temporal nor spiritual need
exhausts it. Spiritual need is the
chief. It desires the salvation of all
men. And when compassion for men&rsquo;s
souls is tenderest, compassion for their
temporal sufferings is usually also tenderest.
The heart is often larger than
the purse; but the purse-strings will
not be closed. Our hospitals and other
institutions for the relief of suffering
and distress owe their origin and support
mainly to Christian sympathy.</p>

<p>2. <i>Ingenuity.</i> &ldquo;<i>Deviseth</i> liberal
things.&rdquo; Many contribute to benevolent
objects when solicited, but
never originate anything in such a
direction. There should be a thoughtful,
holy solicitude to know what is
needed, and how much of it we are
able to do. Those act a useful part
who discover for themselves and suggest
to others suitable and feasible
methods of usefulness. There should
also be conscientious thoughtfulness
as to the proportion to be established
between what God gives to us and
what we give to Him in return. As
Jacob (Gen. xxviii.&nbsp;20&ndash;22).</p>

<p>3. <i>Action.</i> Liberality does not terminate
in feeling and thought (James
ii.&nbsp;15, 16; 1&nbsp;John iii.&nbsp;17, 18). It does
not devise methods of usefulness and
leave them to be carried out by others.
The good Samaritan did not look at
the man who had been robbed and
half-killed on the road and pass on
(Luke x.&nbsp;33, 37). The woman who
brought the alabaster box of ointment
and anointed the feet of Jesus showed
her love to Him more than if she had
spoken a thousand endearing words.</p>

<p>4. <i>Willingness.</i> No selfish churl
strikes out new plans of usefulness.
Such as exists he unwillingly helps,
if he helps them at all. According to
the Christian idea, no amount of mere
giving which does not come from the
willing heart is accepted as liberality.
The voluntary principle is alone recognised
as the principle of liberality.
And voluntaryism means willinghood
(2&nbsp;Cor. viii.&nbsp;12).</p>

<p>5. <i>Continuance.</i> Not by one generous
act, nor by such an act occasionally,
can the title of liberality be won.
Excitable persons impulsively promise,
but reflection brings them to their
true selves; and they either break the
promise or fulfil it grudgingly. Some
undertake Christian work; for a time
do it; perhaps do it well; but <i>after</i> a
time weary of its inconvenience, sacrifice,
and slow results. Now the liberal
man &ldquo;stands by&rdquo; his liberal things.
The other reading is, &ldquo;adheres&rdquo; to
them. Continuance in the race reaches
the goal.</p>

<p>II. <span class="smcap">The soil in which it is nourished.</span></p>

<p>It is engendered and thrives in the
soil of Christianity. For it is in accordance
with&mdash;1.&nbsp;<i>Its Spirit.</i> It is the
spirit of love. The man who drinks
most into the spirit of Christianity
will be most likely to feel such benevolent
interest in humanity as will
take practical shapes. It tends to the
overthrow of selfishness. It fosters the
spirit of self-sacrifice. 2.&nbsp;<i>Its Precepts.</i>
We are commanded to stretch forth
the helping hand to those in need.
We are to extend the kingdom of
Christ. Gifts and offerings in some
form are demanded by the two great
dispensations; by the Gospel no less
than by the Law. He who lives for
himself, giving forth nothing, or giving
with grudging hand, has yet to learn
the first principles of Christian obedience.
3.&nbsp;<i>Its Examples.</i> The newly
formed Church in Jerusalem. Contributions
throughout the churches afterwards
for impoverished Christians
there. Above all the example of
Christ.</p>

<p>Do not suppose that liberality obtains
no recognition. 1.&nbsp;<i>It becomes a source of
pleasure.</i> Let any one put this to the
test. And the pleasure is in proportion
to the sacrifice it costs (Acts xx.&nbsp;35).
2.&nbsp;<i>It is returned in blessing</i> (Prov.
iii.&nbsp;9, 10). We cannot explain how
this comes about, because we cannot
explain the way of God&rsquo;s Providence.
Everything is in His hands. Can bless
or blast your affairs. It certainly
brings spiritual blessing. Exercises,
develops, improves faith, love, self-denial.
The indwelling Spirit of God
is manifested in larger measure. Conscience
<span class="pagenum" id="p358">[p.&nbsp;358]</span>
approves. 3.&nbsp;<i>It will obtain the
final recognition.</i> It is all recorded.
Nothing forgotten, however little.
&ldquo;Cup of cold water.&rdquo; &ldquo;Ye have done
it unto Me.&rdquo; Let us strive for that
commendation of Jesus, and for His
commendation now, such as that He
gave to the widow who gave her
mites, and to the woman who did
what she could.&mdash;<i>J. Rawlinson.</i></p>

<p><b>I. Who are the careless ones in our

Its main object is to arouse the attention

be regarded as a serious man. He is
careless on the most momentous of all
subjects. 2.&nbsp;<i>Those who neglect prayer.</i>
All who have any proper feeling towards
God must regard this as a
solemn duty. Nature teaches its necessity
and importance, the Scriptures
enjoin it with great earnestness (Luke
xviii.&nbsp;1; 1&nbsp;Thess. v.&nbsp;17). 3.&nbsp;<i>Those who
neglect the Sabbath.</i> This &ldquo;made for
man,&rdquo; appointed for his convenience
and spiritual good. An institution of
unspeakable importance as regards
eternity&mdash;in fact, no religion without
it. 4.&nbsp;<i>Those who neglect the institutions
of the sanctuary.</i> Those anxious to
know &ldquo;what they must do to be saved&rdquo;
always prize the preaching of the Gospel.
On the other hand, as the interest
in religion declines, so will be our
indifference to the means of grace.
See you one who makes his attendance
on God&rsquo;s house a matter of convenience,
who avails himself of any trifling excuse
to be absent, &amp;c., there is a careless
one. So also with those who are so
absorbed in the pursuits of this life,
so as to have neither leisure nor disposition
to attend the place of prayer.
5.&nbsp;In a word, those are careless ones
<i>who live in impenitence and unbelief.</i>
Repentance and faith in Christ. The
great interest of the soul cannot be
secured without these, and no man
can be said to take heed to the things
that belong to his peace, without
obeying Christ&rsquo;s commands concerning
them.</p>

<p><b>II. Why such ought to be troubled.</b>
Those who are indifferent are disposed
to remain so&mdash;carelessness perpetuates
itself. Still there are reasons why such
should be troubled. 1.&nbsp;<i>The fact that
you are careless is a ground of alarm.</i>
Carelessness, an evidence of our ignorance
of the true condition of the soul
in the sight of God. Something truly
frightful in false security where the
danger is real and great. With such
this fancied security is the most alarming
symptom. The sinner suffering
from a disease which no human skill
can remove&mdash;in danger of eternal
death. How fearful then the indifference,
how appalling the apathy of
such! 2.&nbsp;<i>This indifference indicates a
state of mind in which every blessing will
be abused, and every warning neglected.</i>
A habit of body that would render
everything received for nourishment
or for medicine useless would be dreadful;
what, then, of that moral disease
which perverts every gift and makes
the diversified means which God employs
accomplish nothing for our good?
3.&nbsp;<i>You ought to be troubled when you reflect
what it is you are careless about,</i> viz.,
your salvation. The man who is indifferent
about his health, or regardless
of his temporal interest, is unwise;
what, then, of one who hazards the
salvation of his soul by neglect? Salvation
is offered in Christ&mdash;indifference
is unbelief. Why so eager after
the acquisition of wealth, and indifferent
about the true riches? 4.&nbsp;Another
cause of alarm <i>is the exposure of your
present position.</i> Neglect of the Gospel
ensures destruction (Heb. ii.&nbsp;3). This
apathy a crime for which no amiableness
or morality can atone. 5.&nbsp;<i>No</i>
<span class="pagenum" id="p359">[p.&nbsp;359]</span>
<i>more powerful means will be employed to
awaken you to the concerns of your soul.</i>
God disclaims any responsibility for
your loss (Isa. v.&nbsp;4; Matt. xxiii.&nbsp;37).
Ministers have preached, Christian
friends have entreated, the Holy Spirit
has been sent down, and still you are
careless. The very heathen will rise
up in judgment. If one rising from
the dead would not make those hear
who had Moses and the prophets, what
shall awaken those who have Christ
and the apostles? 6.&nbsp;<i>This carelessness is
induced, it is not natural.</i> A long process
of hardening the heart is gone through
before such a state of apathy is reached.
But once ours, it has all the force
of habit, and is not easily broken up
(Matt. xi.&nbsp;21). This indifference is
<i>voluntary</i> (Acts xxiv.&nbsp;25). Felix <i>might</i>
have taken a different course. No
iron necessity binds men to the fatal
course they take, but a perverse will
and an unbelieving heart. 7.&nbsp;<i>This carelessness
is a state of mind that provokes
God to withdraw His Spirit.</i> Deeply
criminal. No apathy in heaven, there
ought to be none on earth. Must it
not offend God, to say that He has
failed to reveal Himself in a way to
interest His creatures? And yet men
can be interested in a novel while the
Gospel is neglected. Under the old
dispensation He said, &ldquo;My people
would not hearken to My voice, so I
gave them up to their hearts&rsquo; lust.&rdquo;
What of those who then reject the Son?
8.&nbsp;<i>This indifference will ultimately be
broken up, and will aggravate condemnation
a thousandfold.</i> Though retribution
sleep, it must come and will not tarry.
The Jews were spared forty years after
the Saviour had wept over their doomed
city. So with the sinner; there comes
a time when he can be indifferent no
longer; the realities of judgment and
eternity produce a conviction which
will go on deepening for ever. How
it will embitter the soul then to dwell
upon this carelessness of the past.
Recollection itself a source of misery
(Luke xvi.&nbsp;25). What words can express
the anguish of a soul thus reminded
of lost opportunities, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Throw off this lethargy. From this
moment seek the Lord with your
whole heart, and call upon Him while
He is near. Why run the desperate
hazard of having to do all this on a
dying bed?&mdash;<i>Mark Tucker, D.D.:
National Preacher,</i> vol. vii. p. 138.</p>

<p class="bq">xxxii.&nbsp;13&ndash;15. <i>Upon the land of my people, &amp;c.</i></p>

<p>This chapter commences with a
prophecy of the appearance and the
kingdom of Christ. But instead of
finishing the painting of that beautiful
scene, with what might be anticipated
as the effect of this appearance, Isaiah
proceeds, in our text, to paint a scene
of great desolation and barrenness.
So, when our Saviour came, the effect
of His appearance was by no means
such as might have been expected;
after gathering a few out of the Jewish
nation and thus planting the first
Christian Church, He retired from
the nation, on account of its impenitence
and unbelief; and the land is
still abandoned to desolation and barrenness.
That barrenness, and the
spiritual barrenness and blindness of
that despised people, will continue
until the arrival of the important
event predicted in the last verse.</p>

<p>Though the immediate bearing of
these words is upon the state and
prospects of the Jewish people, yet
they may be considered as assigning
the reason why the nations of the
earth continue in so wretched a state,
with respect to things spiritual and
Divine, as they now exhibit; and as
directing our expectations, and regulating
our confidence, respecting the
final termination of this state of
things. The momentous truth taught
in this passage is, that <i>the ultimate
success of missions depends upon the communication
of the Spirit.</i></p>

<p>That the Spirit of God is afforded
<span class="pagenum" id="p360">[p.&nbsp;360]</span>
at present to the Church is evident
from its existence; for, since the
Church is entirely a spiritual structure,
raised and preserved by that Divine
Spirit, if it had been utterly withdrawn
the Church would have been
annihilated. But the especial time
here announced has not yet arrived;
the Spirit is not &ldquo;poured from on
high&rdquo; in that plenitude and variety
of gifts which may reasonably be expected.</p>

<p>I. That the success of missions
depends on the outpouring of the
Spirit of God, appears to be manifest,
1.&nbsp;From the Scriptures (<i>text:</i> chap.
xli.&nbsp;19, 20; Zech. iv.&nbsp;6, xii.&nbsp;10; Joel
ii.&nbsp;28&ndash;32, with Acts ii.&nbsp;16&ndash;18; Ezek.
xxxix.&nbsp;29). 2.&nbsp;From the record concerning
the Great Captain of our salvation,
He did not enter upon His
work until He was anointed by the
Spirit of God (Luke iv.&nbsp;18, 19).
3.&nbsp;From the experience of the apostles.
Until the effusion of the Spirit from
on high, on the day of Pentecost, they
were not qualified for their work in
the nations to which they were sent.
4.&nbsp;From the testimony of the apostles.
All their successes they attributed to
a Divine agency (Acts xi.&nbsp;21, xiv.&nbsp;27,
xvi.&nbsp;14; 1&nbsp;Cor. iii.&nbsp;5&ndash;7, &amp;c.). 5.&nbsp;From
the testimony of those who have had
the greatest success in preaching the
Gospel in heathen as well as in Christian
<span class="wsnw">lands.<a id="o283_fna1" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#o283_fn1">[1]</a></span>
6.&nbsp;From the records of their most eminent
<span class="wsnw">successes.<a id="o283_fna2" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#o283_fn2">[2]</a></span>
7.&nbsp;From the nature of the work to be
accomplished. Considering the state
of men, it is impossible to suppose
that anything less than a Divine power can change the
<span class="wnsw">heart.<a id="o283_fna3" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#o283_fn3">[3]</a></span></p>

<p>II. There are two reasons why we
are in danger of forgetting our dependence
on the Spirit of God. 1.&nbsp;We
cannot arrange the time and manner
in which the Divine agency will be
exerted; and we are called upon to
exert ourselves in much the same
way as though there were no such
doctrine existing in our creed, and no
such expectation existing in our minds.
Consequently, even while strenuously
attending to our duty, we are very
apt to lose sight of that mysterious
Divine agency on which the success of
all our efforts must depend, and to
direct our attention exclusively to the
apparatus we are setting in motion.
2.&nbsp;This is an invisible power, and is
manifest to us only in its effects;
whereas our own actions and plans
are objects of distinct observation.
It is one thing to believe that there
is an agency of the Spirit, and quite
another thing to have a deep and
practical persuasion of it, and to regulate
all our actions and expectations
in dependence on it.</p>

<p>III. Some practical results which
should follow from our belief that the
success of missions depends on the
agency of the Divine Spirit. 1.&nbsp;In
attempting the work of the evangelisation
of the heathen, we ought to
renounce all expectations of success
founded on our own strength or resources.
2.&nbsp;In connection with every
attempt for the conversion of the heathen,
there should be earnest prayer.
In every period of the world, a spirit
of prayer for this great object has been
the precursor of real success. 3.&nbsp;In
the manner in which we prosecute this
work, we should be exceedingly careful
not to grieve the Spirit of God.
There must be nothing in our conduct
or temper opposed to the simplicity
and purity of the Christian dispensation.
Our mission must not be made
the instrument of ostentation and gratification,
or of amusing the public
by a display of gaudy eloquence. All
rivalry between different societies that
has not for its end the knowledge and
service of God, is offensive in His
sight. Let us guard against the least
disposition to depreciate or hide in
silence the success of others; which
shall lead us to look coolly on the most
splendid acts of missionary labour, unless
they emanate from ourselves, or
bring honour to our party. 4.&nbsp;Our
dependence for the men and the means
wherewith to carry on this great work,
must rest absolutely and exclusively
on God. Whensoever He puts forth
the influence of His Spirit, some of
His servants will devote themselves to
the work, and others of them will
<span class="pagenum" id="p361">[p.&nbsp;361]</span>
gladly contribute to it of their wealth
(Isa. lx.&nbsp;5&ndash;7). 5.&nbsp;The doctrine of the
text teaches us to regulate our confidence
with respect to the success of
every particular mission, at the same
time that it animates that confidence
in regard to the final success of the
success itself. 6.&nbsp;If success in any
field of effort does not reward our toil,
instead of charging God with any arbitrarily
withholding of the help of His
Spirit, let us examine the instruments
wherewith we are endeavouring to
effect so great and important a charge,
and see if there be not in them something
unworthy of the enterprise, and
keeps back the needed blessing.
7.&nbsp;However success may seem to delay,
let us acquiesce, without repining, in
the dispensations of God; and let us
point our views forward to a future
period, that will certainly come, when
the Spirit will be poured out from on
high, and when the Redeemer will
take to Him His great power, and
reign universally in the hearts of
men.&mdash;<i>Robert Hall: Works,</i> vol. vi.
pp. 158&ndash;180.</p>

<p class="gap" id="o283A">As regards the final and universal
triumphs of the Gospel, believers cannot
entertain a doubt. Glorious things
are spoken of Zion, &amp;c. We are explicitly
assured that the kingdoms of
this world shall one day become the
kingdoms of Christ.</p>

<p>But what is to secure this? Our
hope hangs on one thing&mdash;the promise
of the Spirit. Every past conquest
has been the effect of union and
communion with the Comforter; and
our own ability for the enterprises of
the future must be derived from the
same source. The chapter begins with
a cheering account of the approach
of a brighter day following a season
of gloom and depression, which is to be
terminated finally and only by the pouring
out of the Spirit from on high.
So always. Large as are our resources,
we were never more dependent on
help from heaven than now. Without
special Divine aid we can do nothing.</p>

<p>I. The Spirit of God must be with
us, <i>or we shall not use the right means
for converting the world.</i> Our work is
a vast one, but we are not left in uncertainty
as to the way in which it is
to be accomplished. The Gospel made
for man. Sending the knowledge of
Christ abroad through the nations is
the appointed method of saving men.
1.&nbsp;More faith is needed in God&rsquo;s
instrumentality. The cause may seem
unequal to the effect, but a Divine
unseen agency accompanies it, and
difficulties must pass away. 2.&nbsp;No
part of our business to make experiments
for the relief of human woe or
guilt; or dig channels for our compassion
other than those in which the
Saviour&rsquo;s flowed. Calvary our sole
expedient, &amp;c. 3.&nbsp;We need to keep to
the means by which all this is accomplished
without deviation or faltering.
A downward tendency in the best of
men, even when engaged in the holiest
of work, which nothing but a constantly
exerted influence from God
can effectually counteract. Charters, subscriptions,
pledges will not do it.
4.&nbsp;Must not lay our strength out on
extraneous matter. Our true service
only performed while relying on
Divine aid.</p>

<p>II. Unless the Holy Spirit be with
us, <i>we shall never prosecute our work with
proper energy.</i> An enterprise like ours
cannot be expected to flourish unless
it takes fast hold on the hearts and
sympathies of its friends. It is a cause
of too much import to be carried on
lukewarmly. One of the main purposes
of the Church, her own self-extension.
How shall we get up to
this state of feeling, this standard of
action? Never! until we have more
of the Spirit of God.</p>

<p>Again, half our strength has to be
expended in trying to keep our enterprise
up to the lines already reached. We
seem at times to be merely stationary,
and this side by side often with great
secular prosperity. Why this falling
off? And that as contrasting with the
success of primitive believers? They
seem to have carried with them a
never-failing assurance, that where
they planted and watered, God would
give the increase. The Church can
<span class="pagenum" id="p362">[p.&nbsp;362]</span>
never come up to this standard until
the Spirit is more copiously poured
upon us from on high. We are shut
up to this single resource.</p>

<p>III. That the Spirit must be given
us, <i>or we shall never see our efforts crowned
with success.</i> Something in a simple
dependence on Divine help which imparts
to our labours a character so
earnest and decided as betokens a
favourable result. We work best ourselves
when we feel that God is working
in us and by us. Nothing so
nerves the arm and strengthens the
heart as confidence in Him. So Luther,
Whitfield, Paul wrought. Nothing
else will keep zeal alive in the Church.</p>

<p>Hence arises 1.&nbsp;<i>Our encouragement.</i>
Faith in the efficacy of the Gospel
preached under the influence of the
Holy Ghost is to be the mainspring of
all our efforts. The Spirit is to take
of the things of Christ and show them
to men. We can only be straitened
on that side. 2.&nbsp;<i>Our duty.</i> All converging
to a single point&mdash;prayer.&mdash;<i>David Magie, D.D.:
National Preacher,</i> vol. xxi. p. 221.</p>

<p class="gap" id="o283B">Let it be supposed that the invader
and the conqueror have been in our
land. Cultivation has disappeared, impoverishment
and neglect reign over
its once fertile and well-cared-for fields.
The city, formerly the centre of life
and activity, depopulated and desolated.
Its factories dilapidated, its
exchange a ruin, its streets overgrown
with grass. Such was the ruin the
prophet saw about to befall his
country. How long would it continue?
Until God should pour His Spirit upon
the people, so as to turn them from
their iniquities. When the moral
scene changed, the material scene
would also. Prosperity would return.
The city would again be populated;
the country resume its beauty and
fertility; the wilderness would be a
fruitful field, and the fruitful field be
counted for a forest.</p>

<p>It is a picture of the world&rsquo;s moral
desolation without the Gospel; of the
time when the power of the Gospel
shall be displayed; and of the happy
state of the world in that day of its
power. These topics are presented in
the text; the necessity, the certainty,
and the condition of the world&rsquo;s salvation.</p>

<p>I. <span class="smcap">Its necessity.</span> It is a fallen
world. Scepticism at present criticises
the Christian representation of the
moral state of human nature as too
low, while its standard is too high.
Whatever may be said of the latter
part of the indictment, the former part
must be denied. The alienation of the
human heart from God; its aversion
to His holiness; the depth of its pollution,
as evinced in the crimes and
vices which disfigure the face of society,
and are too patent to be refined away.
With all the restraining influences
around us, we have enough at our
hand to justify the representation that
man is morally fallen and desolated.
Add to this the idolatry, with its
attendant cruelty and impurity, prevalent
over so large a population of
the human family. And to this the
extreme and manifold wickedness of
men in history. The Christian representation
of the state of human nature
is fully justified. There is universal
sin. There is need of mercy, change,
conversion. Not merely the adoption,
by large masses of men, for various
reasons, of new religious names and
forms. It is a personal conversion.
Men need the change one by one.</p>

<p>II. <span class="smcap">Its certainty.</span> We should
despair of the world&rsquo;s conversion if
our vision were limited to its existing
state. We should pronounce it as
hopeless as the attempt to tear up the
everlasting mountains from their roots,
or to drive the ocean from its bed.
But we are not thus limited. We are
not at liberty thus to limit our vision.
In the Word of God we find it declared
that the redeeming dominion of Christ
shall be co-extensive with the globe.
Plain statements sometimes, utterly inexplicable
except in this way. Including
these in our vision, we have nothing
to do with the difficulties, but only
with the great duty of their destruction.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="p363">[p.&nbsp;363]</span>
Include in the vision the words of
Christ. His declarations and commands
before leaving the world contemplate
the universal diffusion of His
salvation. And we must include His
work. The expenditure will bear some
relation to the result. It cost the death
of the incarnate Son of God. That the
event is long delayed proves nothing
when we remember how long the world
had to wait for His coming.</p>

<p>III. <span class="smcap">Its condition.</span> The moral
desolation will continue until the
Spirit be poured upon us from on
high. The Gospel only saves as the
Spirit makes it efficacious. The
human heart and will are opposed to
the entrance of the truth. Not only
evidence but influence is required. It
is essentially a spiritual work, and
only the Holy Spirit is equal to it. It
is a work in hearts opposed to God,
and His power can alone produce the
willingness which is the very essence
of the saving change. Every time we
pray for the conversion of sinners and
for the coming of God&rsquo;s kingdom, we
practically acknowledge the necessity
of the Spirit&rsquo;s work. The universal
necessity is the necessity of the individual
case. The world&rsquo;s conversion
is pictured out in the conversion of
every sinner. The power of the Spirit
is the security for the fulfilment of the
Word (Joel ii.&nbsp;28&ndash;32; Acts ii.&nbsp;17&ndash;21;
Ezek. xxxvii.&nbsp;1&ndash;14; John iii.&nbsp;6&ndash;8; 1&nbsp;Cor.
ii.&nbsp;4, 5, iii.&nbsp;6, 7).</p>

<p>From the text, then, we may learn
two or three lessons relative to the
work of Christ&rsquo;s Church in the world.</p>

<p>1. That all such work should be
conducted in humble dependence on
the Holy Spirit. Such dependence
does not supersede labour, any more
than the consciousness that the sun
and the air and other mysterious influences
of nature are necessary, supersedes
the husbandman&rsquo;s labour.</p>

<p>2. That it should be conducted in a
spirit of prayer for the outpouring of
the Holy Spirit. Whatever God promises
to His Church, it is warranted
to ask in prayer. Prayer is the condition,
on the Church&rsquo;s part, on which
the promise is suspended. In that
wonderful passage of Ezekiel where
the Spirit is promised in His cleansing
and renewing power, the condition is
expressly named (Ezek. xxxvi.&nbsp;37).
While the hundred and twenty disciples
were gathered together praying,
the Holy Ghost fell upon them. How
often does the great missionary apostle
ask those who have been brought to
Christ to pray for him in his continued
work among those who have not.</p>

<p>3. That all Christian effort should
be conducted, therefore, in <i>expectation</i>
of the outpouring of the Spirit. Do
we not dishonour Him, when we fail
to believe in the Spirit&rsquo;s work as a
living reality&mdash;when we do not <i>expect</i>
prayerful work for Christ to be followed
by proportionate success! &ldquo;Until
the Spirt be poured upon us from
on high,&rdquo; all is desolation; when the
Spirit shall be poured upon us from
on high, all shall be beauty.&mdash;<i>John
Rawlinson.</i></p>

Brainerd, Schwartz, and Eliot, and
those who in every age have had the most
success in turning men to righteousness, have
been the first to declare that they were
nothing. They, of all men, most ardently
implored, and most entirely depended upon,
the agency we are now contemplating; and
their success appears to have been more in
proportion to their earnest solicitude in seeking
this blessing, than to any other cause.&mdash;<i>Hall.</i></p></div>

<div class="footnote" id="o283_fn2"><p><a href="#o283_fna2"><span class="label">[2]</span></a>
Look at the history of those who have
been the most successful missionaries to the
heathen, and see whether you cannot trace
certain results for which you cannot account
on any other hypothesis than that most
momentous one of a Divine influence, at
certain periods, accompanying their labours.
In the history of Brainerd and Eliot, and
others, you perceive that for a considerable
time there seem to have been the same efforts
employed, the same doctrines taught, the
same earnest and zealous prayers, and the
same watchfulness over their own hearts, and
yet no saving effect produced on others: all
still remained barren; no desirable movement
of the heart was excited; and this continued
for a long period. Such was the state of
things when Brainerd first undertook the
mission to the Indians; but, after a considerable
time, while he was propounding only the
same doctrines, and using only the same
means, the Spirit of God put forth its energy,
and Divine communication was imparted at
one season &ldquo;like a rushing, mighty wind,&rdquo; at
others &ldquo;like the dew and the rain from
heaven,&rdquo; softening and thus opening the
<span class="pagenum" id="p364">[p.&nbsp;364]</span>
heart which had resisted the entrance of
sacred truth, and causing the tear of genuine
penitence to steal down the cheek. Nobody
could doubt that there was some one greater
than a missionary there;&mdash;that the Spirit of
God had changed the barren soil to sacred
ground, and had wetted it, &ldquo;like Gideon&rsquo;s
fleece, with the dews of heaven.&rdquo; And so it
is, my brethren, that every person who has
had any long acquaintance with the Christian
ministry, is aware that there are certain
periods of barrenness and certain periods for
bearing fruit. The same talents, whether
great or small, may be brought into action;
but there shall be some seasons in which
efforts, in no way special, shall be crowned
with extraordinary success.&mdash;<i>Hall.</i></p></div>

Were it the design of God merely to
build a foundation already laid, or to repair a
dilapidated edifice, one might talk of the
efficacy of human suasion; but when that
which is to be done is to create a new
principle, to pour new life into the soul, to
give &ldquo;a new heart,&rdquo; to plant new seeds in a
soil where all has been barrenness and desolation,
to turn waters into new channels, to
effect a total change of heart and character,&mdash;what
can accomplish all this but an almighty
power? Human suasion can operate only on
principles which already exist. When Demosthenes,
with his powerful eloquence, excited
the Athenians to combat, he only called into
action, by a skilful grouping of motives, and
an appropriate exercise of his genius, principles
already existing, but which had lain dormant.
He created nothing new; he transformed
them not into new creatures, but only roused
and stimulated those principles which had
animated the bosoms of nations in resisting
tyranny in every age. But when the apostles
went forth to preach faith in Christ, they
proposed to make a change in the mind and
heart of man to which there was no natural
tendency; they required a creature "dead in
trespasses and sins" to awake to Christ;
they proposed to convert him into a devoted
servant, a subject most loyal, affectionate, and
ardent; and how was it possible that mere
human art or force could accomplish such
changes as these?</p>

<p>The Gospel is the instrument of God, and
wonderfully fitted by Him for His work; but
even <i>it</i> is nothing more than an instrument;
and when it is successful and baffles every
human effort exerted against it, it is because
it is wielded by an omnipotent arm.&mdash;<i>Hall.</i></p>

<h3 class="tdc" id="o284"><span class="smcap">The Moral Wilderness Transformed.</span></h3>

<p class="bq">xxxii.&nbsp;15. <i>Until the Spirit be poured upon us, &amp;c.</i></p>

<p>This chapter contains three distinct
and important topics: the great and
inestimable blessings resulting from
the reign of Christ; a denunciation of
the Divine judgments on an ungrateful
and rebellious people, and especially
on the supine and careless women of
Judea; and an assurance of more
auspicious days.</p>

<p>I. The mind of man resembles a
moral wilderness. This was not the
case originally. In paradise all was
moral attraction and glory. But,
in consequence of man&rsquo;s apostasy
from God, his powers have been
withered, and his Divine beauty has
been defaced. The mind of man is a
moral wilderness&mdash;1.&nbsp;As it is a seat of
sterility and desolation. 2.&nbsp;As, till it
is transformed, it is of little use, because
its best powers are not consecrated
to God. 3.&nbsp;As it is the soil
where noxious and destructive plants
exist and flourish.</p>

<p>II. The means appointed for the
cultivation of the mind of man are to
be diligently employed, because,
1.&nbsp;These means are unfolded to us in the
Gospel. 2.&nbsp;God requires us to employ
them. 3.&nbsp;The Divine sanction and
encouragement have been given to
those who have diligently used them
(H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I., 3424&ndash;3465).</p>

<p>III. The best and most powerful
means will be unavailing without the
agency and influence of the Spirit.</p>

<p>IV. But with the influence of the
Holy Spirit, a great moral transformation
will be effected. 1.&nbsp;There will
be a scene of cultivation; the wilderness
will be converted into a fruitful
field; enclosed, cleansed, irrigated,
carefully tilled; presenting a beautiful
appearance to the eye, and refreshed
with the dews and rains of heaven.
2.&nbsp;There will be a scene of fertility;
as a field, it will be rich in the variety
and luxuriance of its produce; all the
graces of the Holy Spirit will be fully
and beautifully exemplified. 3.&nbsp;There
will be a scene of grandeur. The
fruitful field will be counted for a
forest. A fine forest is a majestic and
striking feature in a landscape. There
<span class="pagenum" id="p365">[p.&nbsp;365]</span>
is dignity, magnitude, elevation; all
these moral characteristics are found
in the mind on which the Spirit has
been poured out. The saints will
grow in grace, and increase with all
the increase of God.</p>

<p>V. Learn from this subject. 1.&nbsp;The
importance of honouring the Spirit by
reverence, worship, obedience, confidence.
2.&nbsp;The necessity of waiting
for the Spirit. Though He tarry, yet
we are perseveringly to wait. 3.&nbsp;The
duty of praying for the Spirit, and
of expressing unfeigned gratitude for
every communication of His grace.&mdash;<i>G.
Clayton: The Pulpit,</i> vol. xvii. p. 190.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 class="tdc" id="o285"><span class="smcap">Peace the Work of Righteousness.</span></h3>

<p class="bq">xxxii.&nbsp;17. <i>The work of righteousness shall be peace; and the effect of righteousness
quietness and assurance for ever.</i></p>

<p>A large part of the book of Isaiah
is taken up in setting forth the glories
and the blessedness of Christ&rsquo;s kingdom.
Sometimes this is done by grand
images drawn from all that is brightest
in the outward world (xxx.&nbsp;26). Sometimes
the great change to be wrought
in mankind is spoken of under the
figure of a like change in the beasts of
the field (xi.&nbsp;6&ndash;9). Again, in other
places, as in the text and the adjoining
verses, the description puts on more of
a moral and spiritual character, and
declares how God will be glorified in
the hearts and lives of men (vers. 15&ndash;17).
On reading these descriptions of
a time when the world is to be full of
peace and blessedness, we can hardly
help wishing we were in such a world.
But that time is not yet come. Many
places may we find, where all seem to
be bent on hurting and destroying one
another. But the sun himself, with
his all-piercing eye, though he beholds
every dwelling of man, cannot see a
single village which is the abode of
peace and quietness and assurance for
ever. Nor has he in all his journeys
ever seen such a state of things. Did the
prophet, then, see falsely? Was the
vision which he saw a lying vision?
Not so. If the &ldquo;work,&rdquo; the effect, is
wanting, it is that the cause is wanting.
Did righteousness prevail upon
the earth, there peace would also prevail.
Wherever we find anything like
true righteousness, and according to
the degree of the likeness, we also find
peace. Whatsoever is done to promote
righteousness will also promote peace.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The work of righteousness shall
be peace.&rdquo; The words have a sweet
sound; but when we think of the
whole meaning that lies wrapt up in
them, they may well strike us with
awe. For while they declare that
righteousness shall produce peace, they
at the same time imply that nothing
but righteousness shall or can. How,
then, can peace ever abide upon earth,
or dwell in the heart of man?</p>

<p>Another disturbing recollection is,
that when it has pleased the all-righteous
God to show forth His righteousness,
as in the days of Noah, the work
of that righteousness was not peace,
but horror, and desolation, and destruction.
Even when the ministers
and executors of earthly righteousness
pass through a land, they do not bring
peace to the culprits who they visit.
How, then, can the perfect righteousness
of God bring peace to the sinful
race of man? There is but one way, a
way purposed by God in the counsels
of His unfathomable wisdom, the way
whereby He vouchsafes to bestow His
own righteousness upon man, to the
end that He may make man partaker
of His peace.</p>

<p>Here some may object, that righteousness,
with its sternness and terrors,
does not seem to be, of all virtues and
graces, the one best fitted to be the
parent of peace. Rather, they may
say, is peace the work of mercy; for
that mercy alone can produce peace,
at least in sinners; wherefore we are
wont to pray God to grant us <i>pardon
and peace.</i> This is true. Unless mercy
be shown to sinners, they can never
enjoy peace. Yet, unless mercy go
<span class="pagenum" id="p366">[p.&nbsp;366]</span>
along with righteousness, mercy cannot
produce peace. If mercy allowed
the sinners to abide in their sins, they
would still be under the sentence
which declares that there is no peace to the
<span class="wsnw">wicked.<a id="o285_fna1" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#o285_fn1">[1]</a></span>
Christ will never give peace alone. He will only give it
along with righteousness,&mdash;first righteousness
and then peace. Unless He
had been the Lord our Righteousness,
He could not have been the
Prince of Peace. Therefore they who
will not receive His righteousness,
cannot receive His peace. To them
He brings no peace, but a sword.</p>

<p>But although the course of this
world has never been answerable to
the magnificent visions of ancient prophecy,
still in some measure the prophecies
have been fulfilled. To the
godly, to all who believe in Christ and
love Him, to all who desire to serve
and obey Him, He has indeed brought
peace; and even amid the endless
tumults and troubles and jarrings of
the world, they feel that He has done
so. They feel that He has set them
at peace with God, by making them
partakers of that righteousness, of
which peace is the work. Moreover,
there is hardly one of our Lord&rsquo;s commandments
which does not tend, in
proportion as we obey it, to fill our
hearts with peace, which does not dry
up one source or another of disquieting, harassing
<span class="wsnw">care.<a id="o285_fna2" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#o285_fn2">[2]</a></span></p>

<p>We may now perceive why there is
so little peace in the world. It is
because there is so little righteousness.
The effect cannot exist without the
cause. The one simple commandment,
&ldquo;Love thy neighbour as thyself,&rdquo; were
it followed through all the branching
duties into which it spreads, would
turn the earth into a garden of peace.</p>

<p>&ldquo;For the wicked,&rdquo; God has said,
&ldquo;there is no peace.&rdquo; But light is sown
for the righteous, the light of joy and
peace. The true disciple of Christ,
he who has sought to be clothed in
Christ&rsquo;s righteousness, will always
enjoy peace, even here on earth. He
will enjoy it in every condition of life.
In riches, in poverty, in health, in
sickness, in every outward circumstance
of life, in the hour of death,
the godly, and they alone, enjoy peace:
in the day of judgment they, and they
alone, will enjoy peace. And the
peace they will have enjoyed till then
will only have been a poor faint foretaste
of the peace into which they will
then enter, of the peace of God, which
passeth all understanding, and in the
full enjoyment of which they will
live thenceforward through eternity.&mdash;<i>Julius
Charles Hare, M.A.: Sermons
Preacht in Herstmonceux Church,</i> pp.
325&ndash;346.</p>

<p class="gap" id="o285A">The Bible is the revelation of a
gracious remedy for evil. Points out
rightful claims of the Divine government.
Charges the human race with
disregard of these claims. Man is
guilty of unrighteousness. There is
universal sin. It is in man&rsquo;s nature.
It constitutes a moral disqualification
for return. God&rsquo;s remedial plan comprehends
the provision of pardoning
mercy, and of regenerating mercy.
The former is found in the work of
the Lord Jesus Christ, which constitutes
a righteous ground on which
the penal consequences of sin may be
remitted. The latter, in this no less
wonderful work of the Holy Spirit by
which the sinner&rsquo;s disposition undergoes
a change that makes him a new
creature in Christ Jesus. Let it be
supposed that this is the universal
experience: instead of unrighteousness,
the righteousness that springs
from such contact with Christ by His
Spirit universally prevails. It is a
change of which we do not despair.
We are taught to expect it. Thus
the text will be universally fulfilled.</p>

<p>I. <span class="smcap">Internationally.</span></p>

<p>One of the most awful facts of
human history is the extent to which
war has marked its track. In the
causes of all wars unrighteousness is
found. But if the supposition we
have made were a reality, wars would
become impossible. Nations and their
rulers would repress the desire to
possess themselves of what is not
their own. If different interests induced
different opinions between them
<span class="pagenum" id="p367">[p.&nbsp;367]</span>
wise and righteous arbitration would
prevent their imbruing their hands
in each other&rsquo;s blood. There would
be &ldquo;quietness and security for ever&rdquo;
(Isa. ii.&nbsp;4, xi.&nbsp;6&ndash;9).</p>

<p>II. <span class="smcap">Socially.</span></p>

<p>1. Would the scenes witnessed in
our streets, and the revelations of
police courts continue, if all men were
characterised by the righteousness
contemplated in our text? Because
men are unrighteous, they encroach
upon each other. The religion of
Christ can be ill spared. Where its
influence prevails, society is better,
happier, more peaceful, more secure
than elsewhere.</p>

<p>2. Think of the family. In the
home all exhibit their true selves.
Selfishness and injustice may render
it a place of incessant strife. But our
Christian homes, even where allowance
has been made for infirmities and
peculiarities, are usually pervaded by
an atmosphere of peace and love. The
influences that surround them produce
mutual forbearance and studiousness
of others, restrain the harder and
develop the softer passions. Just in
the measure in which the subduing
influences of Christian character prevail
will our homes be secure from
strife and discomfort.</p>

<p>3. Think of the Church. There are
divisions in the Church, it is said.
But there is less alienation of heart
than is commonly supposed. The
common Christian&rsquo;s sentiments override
the separated denominations. So
within the churches. Not many, in
proportion to the whole, are divided.
Animosity, as arising from difference
of opinion, is restrained by Christian
love. And if all were perfectly
Christian, there would be none.</p>

<p>III. <span class="smcap">Personally.</span></p>

<p>1. There is peace with God. Because
there is reconciliation in Christ.</p>

<p>2. There is peace within. The
storms of distress and fear raised by
the sense of sin are allayed by the
cross. The discomfort of unsettled
life-purposes is terminated by a
decision with which the soul is satisfied.
Its peace is enhanced by converse
with heaven.</p>

<p>It is abiding peace. The peace in
all aspects continues as long as the
righteousness. The holiness of heaven,
and therefore its peaceful rest, will
continue for ever.</p>

<p>Have we this righteousness? Have
we it in heart, in sympathy, in life?
If not, we are on the side of unrighteousness.
We are insecure. We
need to be born again. O seek to
possess and extend it.&mdash;<i>J. Rawlinson.</i></p>

<div class="footnotes"><h4 class="tdc">FOOTNOTES:</h4>
<div class="footnote" id="o285_fn1"><p><a href="#o285_fna1"><span class="label">[1]</span></a>
We may see this in human things.
When a parent does not uphold <i>order and law</i>
in his family, there will be no peace in that
family. When a government does not uphold
order and law in a nation, there will be no
peace in that nation. They are to be upheld
mercifully indeed; but still they are to be
upheld. Now in man both are imperfect, both
his righteousness and his mercy; and therefore
they are ever jarring. Sometimes he will
lean to the one, sometimes to the other; and
so neither produces the work of peace. But
in God both are at one: neither shall hinder,
neither can give way to the other. Sooner
shall the heavens split, like a breaking wave,
into foam, and melt away, than the slightest
shadow of anything that is not perfectly righteous
shall pass over the righteousness of God.
Accordingly it could only be when perfect
mercy and perfect truth met together, that
righteousness and mercy could kiss each other.
And thus alone shall any ever enjoy perfect
peace, when they have received the full forgiveness
of their sins from the perfect mercy
of God, and are clothed in the perfect righteousness
of Christ. Even in heaven there can
be no peace, except it be the work of righteousness.&mdash;<i>Hare.</i></p></div>

<div class="footnote" id="o285_fn2"><p><a href="#o285_fna2"><span class="label">[2]</span></a>
When He teaches us that the eye of
God is ever watching over us, and the hand of
God ever providing over us,&mdash;when He commands
us to pray to God with confidence as to
our heavenly Father, and to make all our
wants and wishes known to Him,&mdash;hereby, if
we give heed to His bidding, He at once
hushes all those never-ending, still-beginning
anxieties, which are the thorns and thistles
planted by the curse in the human heart.
When He teaches us to love our neighbours,
and to forgive, nay, to love our enemies, He
roots up all the cause which destroy peace
and breed quarrels between man and man.
Every passion that we subdue is so much gain
to our peace; for every passion is a peacebreaker.
Covetousness, ambition, lust,
drunkenness, vanity, pride are peacebreakers.
All these passions set us at variance with
neighbours; all of them set us at variance
with ourselves. Whereas, contentment, temperance,
sobriety, chastity, modesty, meekness
are peacemakers.&mdash;<i>Hare.</i></p></div>

<h3 class="tdc" id="o287"><span class="smcap">Spiritual Husbandry.</span></h3>

<p class="bq">xxxii.&nbsp;20. <i>Blessed are ye that sow beside all waters, that send forth thither the
feet of the ox and the ass.</i></p>

<p>Two explanations of this description
of agricultural life. The first
refers it to the practice of literally
sowing on the waters. In some parts
of the East, particularly in the sowing
of rice, the time chosen is when the
rivers overflow their banks. Cattle
are turned into the wet land to tread
it and prepare it for the seed, which is
then cast upon the water. It subsides
into the ground and yields a quick
harvest. If this is the allusion, the
corresponding passage will be Eccles.
xi.&nbsp;1. The other explanation refers it
to the sowing of seed in soil that is
well watered by its proximity to some
river, and to such a state of security
that the oxen and asses may be turned
upon the land to feed at large, without
fences to limit their excursions. Either
way the general idea is the same. It
is the close of the beautiful description
of peaceful prosperity after the return
from captivity. The land would be
cultivated in security, the harvests
gathered in peace; a splendid contrast
to the desolation of a country which
has been the seat of war.</p>

<p>We apply the text to the privilege
of labouring for the production of a
moral harvest in human souls by the
teaching of the Gospel of Jesus Christ.
Here is&mdash;</p>

<p>I. <span class="smcap">An Analogy between the Material
and the Spiritual Husbandry.</span>
Our present subject is not
our own spiritual culture, although
that is of supreme importance and
the primary qualification for the cultivation
of other souls. We are always
sowing seed, and the fruit of which is in
our character and destiny, in time and
eternity (Gal. vi.&nbsp;7, 8).</p>

<p>The analogy between the moral and
material husbandry is very obvious
(1&nbsp;Cor. iii.&nbsp;6&ndash;9, ix.&nbsp;10, 11; James iii.&nbsp;18;
Matt. xiii.&nbsp;3&ndash;32). This is the
great work committed to the Church.
We are to tell the story of God&rsquo;s love;
to make known the ruin; to proclaim
the salvation; to persuade men.</p>

<p>Now, this supposes several things:&mdash;1.&nbsp;<i>Opportunity.</i>
By the restoration of
Israel to their own land, they would
have the opportunity of which
they had been long deprived. There have
been times when endeavours to teach
God&rsquo;s Word was prohibited. In some
lands it is so still. There are persons
who will not hear. There are classes
and circles, higher and lower, which
are inaccessible to you. None of us
is responsible for sowing the seed when
there is no opportunity. But in so far
as opportunity exists, or can be made,
it behoves all to avail themselves of
it to the full extent of their power.
Mothers have the opportunity with
<span class="pagenum" id="p369">[p.&nbsp;369]</span>
their children. Sunday-school teachers.
Doors opening in heathen lands.
2.&nbsp;<i>Capacity.</i> To sow a field requires some
knowledge of the kind of work. City
men would make sorry work. So the
spiritual sowing requires some capacity.
Two mistakes may be made. There
is the mistake of those who think any
kind of work will do; and of those who
estimate the requirements so highly
and their own power so humbly that
they never venture anything. The
latter deterrent operates largely. It
falls in with the love of ease. It is
sometimes said that the extension of
popular education demands a higher
class of Sunday-school teachers, for instance,
than sufficed some time ago.
Many Christians think their own education
inadequate. It is a mistake.
If we cannot realise our ideal, let us
do our best. Besides, experience does
not show that boys and girls are ahead
of teachers of average intelligence.
And spiritual earnestness is a greater
qualification than even intellectual endowment.
Capacity for Christian
work, like any other, perhaps more than
any other, increases by exercise.
3.&nbsp;<i>Interest.</i> He who would succeed
must be interested in his work. He
who dislikes it or is indifferent to its
results will not do it well. Commonly
what was undertaken merely as an
occupation, or for advantage, becomes
a pleasure. The various labours of
the husbandman interest him. And
this is essential to the spiritual sower.
There must be a disposition for the
work. It presents attractions only to
such as are in sympathy with its great
ends. There must be a sincere belief of
the truth, thorough conviction of its
necessity to man, and a benevolent
desire for the widest dissemination of
its blessings. Working in this spirit,
your interest in it will constantly
deepen. By the prospect of harvest
you will be animated. With the heart
in the work and the love of Christ in
the heart, the sowing time will be
full of spiritual interest. 4.&nbsp;<i>Diligence.</i>
&ldquo;All waters.&rdquo; This suggests earnestness,
energy, promptitude. Throw
all your energy into this work. The
husbandman watches everything that
bears on his husbandry. Business men
spare no pains in working out their
arrangements. We must be equally
diligent.</p>

<p>II. <span class="smcap">The blessedness of being
engaged in the spiritual husbandry.</span></p>

<p>1. <i>In the work itself.</i> It becomes a
pleasure. Knowledge and experience
of the truth increase by communication, as
seed by being sown. Spiritual
enjoyment is deepened. Christian
character grows. Many can say the
sowing days are the happiest. 2.&nbsp;<i>In
the consciousness of usefulness.</i> It is
not labour in vain. Assured that we
shall reap if we faint not. Already
there are signs. Evil is prevented.
One and another are being trained to
goodness. The future career of those
among whom you sow will be influenced
in the most valuable way.
Some will have their passage to the
grave helped. The future world will
be brightened to them, as well as the
present. 3.&nbsp;<i>In the Master&rsquo;s approbation.</i>
As the work goes on, the consciousness
of this is a blessedness.
And when this world is left behind,
His &ldquo;well done.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Address&mdash;1.&nbsp;Those who are sowing,
with words of encouragement.
2.&nbsp;Those who ought to be, with words
of exhortation.&mdash;<i>J. Rawlinson.</i></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 class="tdc" id="o288"><span class="smcap">The Use of Opportunities.</span></h3>

<p class="bq">xxxii.&nbsp;20. <i>Blessed are they that sow beside all waters, &amp;c.</i></p>

<p>I. We may use the language of
the text <i>as a warning against the
neglect of the least opportunity of usefulness
to others.</i> The prophet pronounces
a blessing upon those who are prepared
to scatter seed, not only where
there is a probable prospect of a rich
harvest, but upon whatsoever soil God
shall bring them in contact with. It
is not only by the waters that are
<span class="pagenum" id="p370">[p.&nbsp;370]</span>
sweet and sparkling that the sowing
is to be carried on, but beside the
floods that seem likely to overwhelm.
We are to maintain a lively sense of
our obligation to do good unto all
men as we have opportunity. Even
those who are alive to the reality of
the effect which one man&rsquo;s life and
conversation may have upon another,
nay, who are desirous to be useful to
their brethren in Christ, are under a
great temptation to be ruled by predilections
for or against particular
persons, and to regard some as too
proud, too insincere, too thoughtless
to reward their labour. Or their
affections are so absorbed in one or
two individuals, united with them by
blood or friendship, that they are
rendered comparatively indifferent
about the influence they may exert
upon others. But whether we choose
or no, our power for good or evil
extends over all who come within
our shadow, and we should neglect no
opportunity to make it a power for
good (H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I. 1857&ndash;65, 4596).</p>

<p>II. <i>We should not neglect any opportunity
of securing benefit for ourselves.</i>
Every period of existence is to be
spent under God. Swift and resistless
the waters of life glide on. But
beside them all, the Christian sows his
good seed. Equally in youth, middle
age, and in advancing years, whatsoever
his hand finds to do, he does it
heartily, as unto the Lord; and in
each he reaps a harvest according to
his sowing in that which preceded
it. Blessed through eternity will he
be who sowed wisely and liberally
beside all the waters of life.&mdash;<i>J.&nbsp;R.

<p class="gap" id="o288A">It should be the ambition of us all to
be useful. The difference between
one man who lives a useful, and
another who lives a useless life, is
simply this&mdash;the one improves his
opportunities for doing good and
making others happy, while he
ministers to his own well-being; and
the other lives only for himself, and
reaps the barren harvest of his selfishness.
Life comes but once to each of
us, and blessed are they who, bearing
this over in mind, are careful to &ldquo;sow
beside all waters.&rdquo;</p>

should never forget the many favourable
opportunities for sowing seed <i>on
the clear and untroubled waters of childhood.</i>
II.&nbsp;Another opportunity for
scattering precious seed is <i>on the
troubled waters of strife</i> (Matt. v.&nbsp;9).
III.&nbsp;Another, <i>on the stagnant and
muddy waters of doubt and unbelief.</i> It
often happens that the Christian is
obliged to listen to the vapid and
senseless discourse of those who seek
to bring the religion of the Son of
God into contempt, and if he would
be prepared for such occasions of seed-sowing,
he ought to be a diligent
student of the Word of God, and of
such works as will give him a right
understanding of it. IV.&nbsp;<i>There will

Some time before the return of the
Assyrians, Hezekiah had sought to deprecate
the wrath of Sennacherib, of which terrible
rumours had reached him from Lachish. For
this end he had sent ambassadors, in the
hope that they might possibly convince the
great king that no treachery was intended,
and save the country from a second invasion,
or possibly even obtain favourable terms for
Lachish itself. The embassy had found him
at the city, which was soon after taken by
storm, and delivered to the tender mercies of
the soldiery. A slab from his palace at Nineveh,
now in the British Museum, shows him
in state &ldquo;receiving plunder of the town of
Lachish.&rdquo; He sits on a throne before his
tent, two arrows in one hand and his bow in
the other, while prisoners are being brought
before him, an officer, attended by a guard,
stating the facts respecting them. Two
eunuchs stand with feather flaps to wave over
him for coolness, and to keep away the flies.
Two horses, ready for his use, are behind,
soldiers with tall lances attending them. The
front rank of prisoners before him kneel to
implore mercy, and behind them is a long file
of their unfortunate companions. Some
whose fate has already been decided have
been led a short way off and killed; others
may be spared as slaves. A chariot with two
horses stands near&mdash;perhaps that of Sennacherib&mdash;and
numerous fruit-trees over the
whole slab show the fruitfulness of the country.

<h3 class="tdc" id="o290"><span class="smcap">The Saint&rsquo;s Attitude in the Time of Trouble.</span></h3>

<p class="bq">xxxiii.&nbsp;2. <i>O Lord, be gracious unto us; we have waited for Thee: be Thou their
arm every morning, our salvation also in the time of trouble.</i></p>

<p>Like its predecessor, this prophecy
belongs to the time of distress and
fear incident on the threatened Assyrian
invasion. Dependence on Egypt
had failed. So had Hezekiah&rsquo;s present
to the invader. He had accepted
the present, but had still pressed on.
The south of Judah was covered with
his soldiers. Isaiah lifts up this prayer
for his country. An example to Christians
to interest themselves in the politics
of their country, and to include
them in their prayers. We have never
known the terrible presence of an invader;
but there is always occasion
for appeal to the Divine Governor and
Helper. It is no mark of spirituality
of mind to exclude national affairs
from thought, as belonging to a sphere
that has nothing to do with God or
with prayer.</p>

<p>The prophet&rsquo;s eye saw, in the immediate
future, the frustration of the
invader&rsquo;s plans. The God of Israel
would interpose. The invasion was
unjust; the negotiations had been
conducted deceitfully by the enemy;
ruin would fall on his head (ver. 1).
But the certainty of deliverance was
no reason for the relaxation of effort,
or for abstinence from prayer. God&rsquo;s
promise is the encouragement and
directory of prayer. Therefore he
cries, &ldquo;O Lord, be gracious unto us.&rdquo;
&amp;c.</p>

<p>The prayer of the text is applicable
to any time of trouble in the personal
experience of any Christian. It is a
time that may come to any one. It
should enter into our calculations
about the future, however exempt
from it at present. It should be prepared
for, as for old age, or death.
We never know when it hangs over
us, nor in what form. To all it comes
occasionally; to some frequently; to
some constantly; to some severely.
Often from quarters whence least expected.
Things and persons most
precious to us are sometimes the occasion
of bitterest grief. The common
lot. We can only really prepare for
<span class="pagenum" id="p372">[p.&nbsp;372]</span>
it by the possession of resource which
it cannot diminish. This is one of the
points at which Christians have so
largely the advantage over others.
God is always with them, and always
accessible.</p>

<p>Our text represents the saint&rsquo;s attitude
in &ldquo;the time of trouble.&rdquo; He
cries to God and waits and waits as he cries.</p>

<p>I. <span class="smcap">He cries to God.</span></p>

<p>How precious to have a friend so
interested in you that anything you
say about your trouble will find an
interested listener. It is a relief to
speak to such a friend. Many of
God&rsquo;s people find this relief every
day. Many a trouble can be told
to none but Him who keeps every
secret and sympathises with every
distress (P.&nbsp;D. 462, 463).</p>

<p>What do we need in the time of
trouble? It is all in this prayer:
<span class="smcap">God Himself.</span> Each petition resolves
itself into something that God is, and
is to us.</p>

<p>1. <i>His Graciousness.</i> The root of
everything must be the Divine disposition.
He might be malevolent, unpitying,
unmerciful. There might be
a cause of separation sufficient to prevent
any favourable access to Him.
In the case of multitudes there is such
a cause. Many live without God,
ignore Him, disregard His authority,
yet in the time of trouble imagine they
may fly to Him, in the face of His
Word, which says until sin is abandoned
there can be no friendship with
Him. He has provided a gracious
way of reconciliation. The first step
we must take is the coming to Him
through the Saviour for the mercy
that obliterates all past transgressions.
In many cases the time of trouble is
sent as the means of leading us to the
Saviour. To be assured of His gracious
disposition while He permits the
trouble, goes far towards the comfort
of the troubled heart. He loves you
although you are under discipline.
The sun shines in full splendour although
it is hidden behind a cloud.
We may wait patiently for the trouble
to pass away, so long as we can confidently
ask the Lord to be gracious
unto us.</p>

<p>2. <i>His Strength.</i> &ldquo;Be Thou their
arm every morning.&rdquo; The time of
trouble reveals our weakness. Mental
energy, courage, bodily power often
succumb under the pressure of heavy
trouble. We realise the value of a
strength beyond our own. It is better
to pass through &ldquo;the time of trouble&rdquo;
with God for our arm every morning,
than to be exempt from trouble and
left without Him. Paul groaned under
the pain of his thorn in the flesh
and besought the Lord thrice to take
it away. But Christ&rsquo;s assurance, &ldquo;My
grace is sufficient for thee, for my
strength is made perfect in weakness,&rdquo;
together with his experience of its
sufficiency, made him glory in his infirmity.
We need the arm of God for
defence against the enemy; to lean upon
for the work that may be necessary to
our extrication from trouble.</p>

<p>3. <i>His Salvation.</i> From some troubles
salvation cannot be in the shape of
restoration of the previously existing
state of things. The young man loses
his precious wife and child; and in their
grave it seems that every interest for
him is buried. They cannot be restored.
But God&rsquo;s salvation can come
to him in the form of a richer spiritual
experience, a deeper acquaintance with
His Word and Way, a completer consecration
to His service, and a larger inflowing
of Divine consolation than he
could have known without it. But
there are some troubles from which
salvation comes by their cessation: sicknesses,
and business reverses. They
are severe while they continue. But
deliverance comes. In some cases
greater prosperity is realised than
formerly, to which, in God&rsquo;s wonder-working
Providence, the trouble was
necessary. Joseph in Egypt. Job.
The trouble may have been severe
temptation. If saved, you are the
stronger for it. Cry to God in trouble.
Let it be the time of special prayer.</p>

<p>II. <span class="smcap">He Waits on God.</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;We have waited for Thee.&rdquo; This
ever accompanies true prayer. The
<span class="pagenum" id="p373">[p.&nbsp;373]</span>
believer looks for the blessing he has
asked. It implies, 1.&nbsp;<i>Faith.</i> That God
hears. Faith has a very close relation
to prayer. 2.&nbsp;<i>Expectation.</i> There may
be degrees of confidence, but there
must be more or less of expectancy.
The sailor&rsquo;s mother watches at the
window for the ship in which her son is
coming. 3.&nbsp;<i>Patience.</i> Wait God&rsquo;s time.
Until His end is accomplished. Thus
let the Church wait for the coming
of Christ, which will be full salvation.</p>

<p>May we know by experience the
blessedness of knowing God in time of
trouble! Blessed is the people that is
in such a case. Come and enjoy this
blessedness. Decide for the Lord Jesus
Christ. The world is insufficient. Renounce
it.&mdash;<i>J. Rawlinson.</i></p>

<h3 class="tdc" id="o291"><span class="smcap">The Importance of Religious Knowledge.</span></h3>

<p class="tdc">(<i>Sunday School Anniversary.</i>)</p>

<p class="bq">xxxiii.&nbsp;6. <i>And wisdom and knowledge shall be the stability of thy times,
and strength of salvation.</i></p>

<p>Primarily these words seem to have
been spoken of Hezekiah, of the happiness
and security which the Jews
experienced under his reign,&mdash;a reign
which was evidently blessed of God
to their good; but, like many other
predictions, it has a larger application.
It refers to the kingdom of
the Messiah; to the blessings resulting
from the reign of Christ over His
redeemed people (chap. xxxii.&nbsp;1, 2).
The declaration is, that in the time of
the Messiah there should be a diffusion
of knowledge so wide and efficacious
that society should be rendered
stable and tranquil by it; that this
wisdom and knowledge should produce
salvation, or deliverance from
temporal and spiritual calamities; and
that this salvation should be a strong
one. This has been already in part
fulfilled; but only in part. Christianity
introduced religious light; and
that light became the parent of every
other kind of useful and excellent
knowledge. So little opposition is
there between Christianity and true
science, that all the most important
discoveries of a scientific nature, all
the knowledge whence nations derive
power and refinement, have occurred
in Christian nations, and Christian
nations only. It is now generally
agreed that it is only from the diffusion
of wisdom and knowledge that
we can expect settled and tranquil
times. But we must remember that
there is no real connection between
mere scientific knowledge and moral
influence. The proposition which I
shall endeavour to establish is, that
<i>no moral influence is exerted, except by the
truths revealed to us in the Scriptures;
and that whatever effects are produced by
knowledge of any other kind, those effects
do not constitute a real moral improvement,
either of society or of individuals.</i></p>

<p>I. <span class="smcap">I appeal to the authority of
Scripture.</span> The Bible is favourable
to knowledge. Every Jewish parent
was commanded to teach his children
diligently the laws and statutes
which God had given, and the historical
circumstances with which they
were connected; that so they might
be, in the sight of all nations, a wise
and understanding people. The New
Testament likewise commands all believers
diligently to study the facts
and doctrines of their faith. Neither
the Mosaic nor the Christian religion
was founded in ignorance. But throughout
the Old Testament, where any moral
influence is ascribed to wisdom, it
is the true knowledge of God that is
to be understood, and that only. So
in the New Testament, so far from
finding any intimation that mere knowledge,
of any and every kind, is sufficient
to exert a moral influence on the
heart and mind, we find passages in
which it is represented as operating to
the hindrance of salvation (Matt. xi.&nbsp;25;
1&nbsp;Cor. i.&nbsp;21; Col. ii.&nbsp;8).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="p374">[p.&nbsp;374]</span>
II. <span class="smcap">I appeal to reason.</span> Reason
shows&mdash;1.&nbsp;<i>That religious knowledge
tends to produce moral results.</i> This is
the natural effects of the truths it
presents to the mind, and of the standard
of duty which it holds up before
us. 2.&nbsp;<i>That all kinds of knowledge
which exert no power upon the conscience
must leave the life unreformed.</i> He who
expects a moral result from mere
worldly knowledge, looks for an effect
without a cause; as well might he
expect a man to become a skilful botanist
by studying astronomy. To improve
the morals you must give moral
instruction; and this is what no
branch of science even professes to do.
We take nothing from the just value
of science by confining it to its proper
objects. One science only can improve
your morals, even that Divine philosophy
which describes, with authority,
the manner of life to which God, your
Sovereign and Judge, requires you to
conform.</p>

<p>III. <span class="smcap">I appeal to experience.</span> Reason
shows that between religious knowledge
and morality there is a connection,
and that between morality and
any other knowledge there is no connection
<span class="wsnw">whatever.<a id="o291_fna1" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#o291_fn1">[1]</a></span>
And this is also the testimony of experience in
all times and <span class="wsnw">countries.<a id="o291_fna2" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#o291_fn2">[2]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Conclusion.</span>&mdash;1.&nbsp;<i>Morality must have
a religious base.</i> Man must be taught
not only what is right, but why it is
right; and he must be shown that he
is bound to do it. The term &ldquo;duty&rdquo;
refers not merely to the action which
is to be done, but to the obligations to
do it. Take away the morality of the
Bible from that which God has
connected it, and you make it powerless.
Moral influence and power come
only from the whole truth of God
2.&nbsp;<i>The whole truth of God is used by the
Holy Spirit as an instrument to effect
moral reformations, and that truth only.</i>
We have here another most important
reason for looking for the advancement
of morality from the diffusion of such
truth <span class="wsnw">only.<a id="o291_fna3" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#o291_fn3">[3]</a></span>
3.&nbsp;<i>Religious truth benefits
only those who make it their earnest
study.</i> It does not operate necessarily.
The Bible must be diligently read,
with much prayer that its teachings
may be applied to your conscience;
that they may be in you a good seed
sown in good ground. 4.&nbsp;<i>The duty of
parents is thus made plain.</i> 5.&nbsp;<i>We see
also the true aim and the extreme value
of Sunday schools.</i>&mdash;<i>Richard Watson:
Works,</i> vol. ix. pp. 458&ndash;471.</p>

<p class="gap" id="o291A"><b>I. What constitutes &ldquo;stability of
times?&rdquo;</b> 1.&nbsp;Civil order and subjection
to law. 2.&nbsp;A regular flow of
commerce, and employment for the
general orders of men. 3.&nbsp;Freedom
from war, defensive or aggressive.</p>

<p><b>II. What influences has the &ldquo;wisdom
and knowledge&rdquo; of Christianity
on &ldquo;the stability of times?&rdquo;</b> 1.&nbsp;The
principles and rules of Christianity
are those of practical &ldquo;wisdom and
knowledge,&rdquo; and, must, if acted on,
give &ldquo;stability of times.&rdquo; Look at its
instructions in relation to civil government
(Rom. xiii.&nbsp;1, 2, 6, 7; 1&nbsp;Tim. ii.&nbsp;1&ndash;3);
to the domestic and social duties of
life (Col. iii.&nbsp;18&ndash;iv.&nbsp;1; 1&nbsp;Tim. vi.&nbsp;1); to
integrity, industry, and love of our
fellow-men (Rom. xiii.&nbsp;8&ndash;10; 1&nbsp;Thess.
iv.&nbsp;2). Universal conformity to such
precepts would produce universal harmony,
industry, and confidence. With
equal clearness it denounces oppression,
insubordination, and war. Were
those injunctions and prohibitions
heeded, a new era of settled prosperity
would begin (H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I. 1124&ndash;1132,
1134). 2.&nbsp;Christianity gives &ldquo;stability
of times&rdquo; by the <i>intellectual</i> wisdom
and knowledge it imparts. What
a contrast in this respect between
Christian and heathen nations! Christianity
promotes intellectual strength
by the grandeur of the subjects which
it brings before the mind, by the freedom
it enjoins in the exercise of every
right, and by the rules it gives for the
government of nations and the guidance
of individuals. And its instructions
are those of wisdom and mental
strength. Moreover it enlarges the
conceptions of those who receive it,
by leading them to strive to promote
the welfare of the whole world.
3.&nbsp;By its <i>sanctifying</i> influence. The real
causes of peace and permanent prosperity
<span class="pagenum" id="p375">[p.&nbsp;375]</span>
are moral; and the very tendency
of Christianity is to promote
civil order, integrity, industry, and
benevolent conduct (H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I. 4164&ndash;4166).
4.&nbsp;By leading men to that
obedience to the laws of God which
brings down upon them His blessing.</p>

<p>From all this it follows, 1.&nbsp;That it
is the wisdom of every nation that has
the knowledge of Christianity to retain
and improve it, and to guard against
its corruption and abuse. Whatever
diminishes its purity weakens its practical
influence. 2.&nbsp;That we should
gratefully acknowledge how much we
owe to God for &ldquo;the wisdom and
knowledge&rdquo; which He has imparted
to us. Let us trace our prosperity to
its true cause. 3.&nbsp;That national ruin
will be the result, if we reject &ldquo;the
wisdom and knowledge&rdquo; God has
vouchsafed to us. 4.&nbsp;That every one
who seeks for himself the &ldquo;wisdom
and knowledge&rdquo; of the Bible is a
patriot. He adds, in his own personal
religion, to the stability and wealth of
the nation. 5.&nbsp;That true patriotism
will lead us to value and support those
institutions which exist for the diffusion
of the Gospel in our own and
other lands.&mdash;<i>John Johnson, M.A.:
Sermons,</i> vol. ii. pp. 156&ndash;177.</p>

<p class="gap" id="o291B"><b>I. Wisdom and knowledge both resemble
and differ from each other,
and should be carefully distinguished.</b>
Many have great knowledge and no
wisdom. Some have wisdom and little
knowledge. Wisdom is knowledge
digested and turned to account; knowledge
is the food changed into chyle and
blood, and sent through the system.
Knowledge is often a mere chaotic
mass; wisdom is that mass reduced to
order. Knowledge may remain inactive
in the memory and understanding;
wisdom is the same turned to
practice and incarnated in life. Many
men possess great knowledge, but hold
it in unrighteousness; hold it along
with folly, indolence, and a host of other
counterbalancing elements. The wise
man may err like others; but his
general conduct and the general course
of his mind are well regulated. &ldquo;Wisdom
is profitable to direct.&rdquo; Knowledge
puffeth up; but wisdom is too
calm and moderate, too wide in its
views, and too sober in its spirit to
be often found in alliance with undue
self-esteem. The man of knowledge
resembles Dr. Kippis, of whom Hall
said that he put so many books in his
head that his brains could not move.
In a mind like Burke&rsquo;s, the more books
that were heaped upon the fiery and
fertile brain the better; it turned them
into flame (H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I. 3091, 3092,
3112&ndash;3120).</p>

<p><b>II. Knowledge and wisdom, when
combined, give stability to persons,
states, and churches.</b></p>

<p>1. <i>To individual character.</i> Knowledge
is being increased at a wonderful ratio.
The learned man of a century ago would
now be thought a sciolist. But there
have been many drawbacks; many incapable
of grasping all kinds of knowledge
are not incapable of pretending
that they have grasped them; hence
the desire of intermeddling with all
knowledge becomes pre-eminent folly,
and hence generally the preference
given to man of showy attainments,
glib talk, and immodest assurance,
above those of solid strength and
genuine insight. And it is the same,
too often, in the Church. In reference
to this, let the words of the wise man
be pondered: &ldquo;With all thy getting,
get understanding.&rdquo; Even though our
knowledge be less wide, let it be accurate.
Let us ballast knowledge with
common-sense; let our piety be manly;
let our attitude be that of calm but
constant progress. And let our motto
be, &ldquo;The greatest of these is charity.&rdquo;
Such a combination of knowledge and
wisdom would give, as nothing else
can, stability to individual character
(H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I. 3075&ndash;3078).</p>

<p>2. <i>In reference to states and kingdoms.</i>
Here, too, knowledge must
meet with wisdom ere genuine stability
can be secured. This was manifested
in the last French and German war.
Indeed, the whole history of France
shows the evil of knowledge being
separated from wisdom. We see this
<span class="pagenum" id="p376">[p.&nbsp;376]</span>
in its brilliant, but rash and dangerous
science; in its literature&mdash;splendid in
form, inferior in substance; in its
raging love for display and thirst for
war; in its popular idols&mdash;Henry IV.,
Mirabeau, Voltaire, and Napoleon&mdash;all
men as full of ability as they were destitute
of true wisdom.</p>

<p>3. <i>The Church.</i> The whole Bible
has been taken to pieces. All the conceivable
knowledge on the subject has
been amassed. Now, here comes in
the place for the exercise of wisdom.
Let us not leap to conclusions; let us
rather ask: &ldquo;Where does wisdom
dwell, and where is the place of understanding?&rdquo;
There is at present a
divorce between knowledge and wisdom
in spiritual matters; and seldom
were manly morality and true religion
in a feebler condition than in some
quarters. There are noise and sound
enough and to spare; but there is a
lack of stability,&mdash;no progress at once
in piety and intelligence (H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I. 3153&ndash;3155).
Out of that gulf into which
one-sidedness has plunged us, all-sidedness,
broad charity, and wisdom can
alone deliver us. Let us pray that
these may abound, and introduce a
period when wisdom and knowledge,
walking hand in hand, shall be the
stability of a better and nobler era!&mdash;<i>George
Gilfillan: The Study and the
Pulpit, New Series,</i> vol. vi. pp. 9&ndash;11.</p>

<p class="gap" id="o291C">These were the words of comfort
by which Hezekiah was prepared to

and were invariably overtaken
by the calamities from which they
sought refuge. Hezekiah put his trust
in Jehovah, and was not disappointed.</p>

<p>The text contains, at the same time,
a general principle, viz., <i>that wisdom
(or practical religion) and knowledge are
the best elements of the stability of any
people.</i> As patriots let us carefully
consider it.</p>

<p><b>I. Christianity promotes wisdom
and knowledge.</b></p>

<p>1. <i>Christianity promotes wisdom.</i>
(1.)&nbsp;The God whom the Bible reveals is
the fit object of reverence and love.
It reveals the Divine attributes in
forms the most fitted to fill the soul
with solemn awe and reverence. It
ascribes to Him eternal and unchangeable
love, and reveals that love in
forms of ineffable grace and mercy.
It does not efface any of the more
awful attributes of Godhead, or merge
them in a perverted view of the parental
relation; nor does it degrade
His more amiable attributes into the
tenderness, or rather weakness, which
loses sight of the criminal&rsquo;s guilt in the
consideration of his misery&mdash;the
world&rsquo;s conception of the Divine!
<i>That</i> character, however, is not enough
to rekindle the flame of piety in a
fallen world (James ii.&nbsp;19). But
(2.)&nbsp;Christianity provides, in the great
facts through which it conveys the
knowledge of God, the means of
reducing men to contrition and restoring
them to hope. The Gospel is
adapted to convert the soul. How?
In its adaptation the element of hope
occupies no mean place. Any scheme
of regeneration must contain a provision
of mercy. By its mode of opening
the door of hope; it impresses
sinfulness on the mind; it moves to
repentance, and inspires obedience on
the ground of conscious obligation to
Divine grace. The tendency of the
doctrine of the cross is no doubtful
matter (Rom. i.&nbsp;16).</p>

<p>2. <i>Christianity promotes knowledge.</i>
It points out the only true way to the
knowledge of God; but further it promotes
general knowledge. (1.)&nbsp;Revealing
God, it makes known the highest
truths; and, making known the highest
truths, it promotes and facilitates
inquiry into every other. The uncovered
heavens reflect their light on
all earthly things. (2.)&nbsp;By the healing
power which it applies to the heart
and conscience, it fits the soul for
vigorous and healthful action. The
Christian can have no reason to dread
the advances of knowledge&mdash;he may
tremble for the temporary evils resulting
from philosophy, falsely so
<span class="wsnw">called.<a id="o291_fna4" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#o291_fn4">[4]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="p377">[p.&nbsp;377]</span>
<b>II. By promoting wisdom and knowledge,
Christianity establishes a
people.</b></p>

<p>1. <i>It purifies and elevates society.</i>
(1.)&nbsp;It is an acknowledged fact that the
Gospel makes man unfit for a state of
slavery. It may teach submission to
the bond, but it will create a moral
influence whose fire will melt his
chains. (2.)&nbsp;The Gospel civilises the
savage. It produces dissatisfaction
with his abjectness, and creates the
desire and imparts the means of rising
in the scale of intelligence.</p>

<p>2. <i>If Christianity thus elevates, how
much more will it establish!</i> If it imparts
life, how much more will it
maintain it! But what are the
means of the stability of a nation?
(1.)&nbsp;<i>Religion.</i> This is the foundation
of all others. An irreligious and
wicked nation has the elements of
misery and dissolution within itself;
a righteous nation, like a righteous
individual, may be afflicted, but, as
in the one case, so in the other,
&ldquo;all things work together for good.&rdquo;
Knowledge has an indirect influence.
Galileo could sacrifice truth and honour
to escape imprisonment; the tale of
Bacon&rsquo;s moral weaknesses is a humbling
page of human history; but the diffusion
of knowledge tends to correct
a taste for low and sensual habits.
(2.)&nbsp;<i>Virtue.</i> Religion produces the
best morals; here the connection is
direct and immediate. The Gospel
provides an authoritative principle&mdash;wanting
elsewhere&mdash;which responds
to its moral precepts, and renders it
a matter of moral necessity to give a
ready and cheerful obedience.
(3.)&nbsp;<i>Freedom.</i> The foundation of this is
in the virtue which Christianity creates
and promotes. If the ark of God were
in danger, we might well tremble for
the ark of liberty; religious degeneracy
endangers the existence of freedom.
(4.)&nbsp;<i>Good order.</i> This follows,
as the natural and necessary consequence
from the promotion of virtue
and freedom.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Conclusion.</span>&mdash;British society, with
all its boasted civilisation, is only in a
state of childhood; it speaks as a child
and it acts as a child. We expect
better days, not as the result of a
natural and inherent tendency to progress
and improvement, but as the
result of the operation of Divine principles
implanted in the midst of us,
under the blessing of a favourable
Providence. That we may put forth
our strength to accomplish this change,
we must have an adequate impression
of existing evils and of our obligation
to apply a remedy. Christianity is the
lever by which we can raise man (Eph.
v.&nbsp;14).&mdash;<i>John Kennedy, D.D.: Weekly
Christian Teacher,</i> vol. iii. pp. 769&ndash;764,
777&ndash;781.</p>

<div class="footnotes"><h4 class="tdc">FOOTNOTES:</h4>
<div class="footnote" id="o291_fn1"><p><a href="#o291_fna1"><span class="label">[1]</span></a>
What connection is there between the
knowledge of mechanics and morality? What
moral duty have you impressed on the conscience
when you have taught a man to make
a table? So with the knowledge of numbers,
or of language, whether ancient or modern.
In none of these sciences is there any principle
that can connect itself with moral feeling.&mdash;<i>Watson.</i></p></div>

<div class="footnote" id="o291_fn2"><p><a href="#o291_fna2"><span class="label">[2]</span></a>
The Gospel was first preached, beyond
the limits of the Jewish church, to a very refined,
but to a very immoral people. Even with
what they had learned from tradition, the wisest
among them&mdash;I may not even except Socrates&mdash;could
contemplate with perfect indifference,
and even practise, the most abominable
vices. The same results are found in our own
day. Wherever infidelity prevails, we witness
the decay and destruction of moral principle.
We find, perhaps, some exceptions in Christian
countries; but let us see how they are produced,
and we shall find that they prove the
rule. They proceed from awe of public
opinion; from a feeling of shame with regard
to personal honour and character. But what
provides that standard whose elevated purity
men thus practically acknowledge, even while
they reject its source? It is this book, it is
the faithful preaching of the Gospel, which so
keeps up the standard of public opinion that
even infidels are obliged to acknowledge its
authority. Even among our peasants who have
been carefully instructed in religious truth&mdash;men
without a single ray of science&mdash;we find
the practice of all the Christian virtues; whilst,
too often, we see the brightest beams of human
philosophy gliding and giving splendour to
baseness and corruption.&mdash;<i>Watson.</i></p></div>

<div class="footnote" id="o291_fn3"><p><a href="#o291_fna3"><span class="label">[3]</span></a>
Along with the truth of God there
goes an accompanying influence. The words
that are spoken to you are &ldquo;spirit and life:&rdquo;
this is because the illuminations of the Holy
Ghost go along with them. We may not overlook
the fallen state of man; he is dead in
trespasses and sins. The very law is weak
<span class="pagenum" id="p378">[p.&nbsp;378]</span>
through the flesh; it gives direction, but it
cannot give life. The Spirit must convince
man of sin and righteousness; and if He be
removed, the Agent is taken away by whom
only our moral renovation can be effected.
Now, this blessed, this mighty Spirit only
works on our hearts in connection with His
own revealed truth; it is not with human
science that He works for the amendment of
our principles and tempers.&mdash;<i>Watson.</i></p></div>

<div class="footnote" id="o291_fn4"><p><a href="#o291_fna4"><span class="label">[4]</span></a>
I fear it is incontrovertible that what
is denominated poetic literature, the great
school in which taste acquires its laws and
refined perceptions, and in which are formed,
much more than under any higher, austerer
discipline, the moral sentiments, is, for the far
greater part, hostile to the religion of Christ;
partly by introducing insensibly a certain
order of opinions unconsonant, or, at least,
not identical with the principles of that religion,
and still more by training the feelings
to a habit alien from its spirit. And in this
assertion I do not refer to writers palpably
irreligious, who have laboured and intended
to seduce the passions into vice, or the judgment
into the rejection of Divine truth, but to
the general community of those elegant and
ingenious authors who are read and admired
by the Christian world, held essential to a
liberal education, and to the progressive
accomplishment of the mind in subsequent
life, and studied often without an apprehension,
or even a thought, of their injuring the views
and temper of spirits advancing, with the New
Testament for their chief instructor and guide,
into another world.&mdash;<i>John Foster.</i></p></div>

<h3 class="tdc" id="o292"><span class="smcap">God Avenging His Own Elect.</span></h3>

<p class="bq">xxxiii.&nbsp;7&ndash;12. <i>Behold, their valiant ones shall cry without, &amp;c.</i></p>

<p>I. <span class="smcap">A picture of desolation.</span></p>

<p>The picture has two distinct points
of interest&mdash;1.&nbsp;<i>Man</i> (ver. 7). Desolation
receives nowhere so strong and
pathetic expression as in the strong cries
and tears of a man. The purer and
nobler the man, so much the more affecting
is it to hear his despairing cry and
look upon his tears. The child cannot
bear to see his father weep, because
his father is to him the ideal man.
Eliakim&rsquo;s grief, on returning from the
interview with Rabshakeh, would be
more grievous to Hezekiah than
Shebna&rsquo;s. Peter&rsquo;s repentant tears
were bitter; but by the cry of the
Christ, <span lang="arc-Latn">&ldquo;Eloi! lama sabathani?&rdquo;</span> and
His tears at the grave of Lazarus, we
are much more affected. 2.&nbsp;<i>Nature</i>
(vers. 8, 9). The world is partly
bright and beautiful, because noble
men of God dwell in it; Nature reflects
and interprets man. The Assyrian
invader weighed heavily on
Jewish hearts (xxxvi.&nbsp;22, xxxvii.&nbsp;1)
and the Jewish land.</p>

<p>II. <span class="smcap">The redresser of wrong.</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Now will I rise, saith the Lord,&rdquo;
&amp;c. 1.&nbsp;<i>God rules the world in the
interests of His people.</i> &ldquo;Now will <i>I</i>
rise.&rdquo; Democrats are fond of saying,
&ldquo;The Queen may reign, but she does
not govern;&rdquo; but the reins of government
are firmly held by the great I
AM. 2.&nbsp;<i>God&rsquo;s interposition comes at
the right moment:</i> &ldquo;<i>Now</i> will I rise.&ldquo;
Man&rsquo;s extremity is often God&rsquo;s opportunity;
because not until his case
is desperate, will he cast himself unreservedly
upon God. So man often
retards the arrival of the right moment.
Meanwhile the innocent (comparatively)
suffer for the guilty; the
good for the bad, the just for the
unjust. If it is the teaching of Scripture
that God&rsquo;s people are &ldquo;the salt
of the earth,&rdquo; preserving it from destruction,
it is no less the doctrine of
the Bible that untold sorrows are to
the righteous because they dwell on
the earth with the wicked. The
Isaiahs and Hezekiahs of the world
feel something of the weight of the
world&rsquo;s sin. But there is always a
&ldquo;thus far and no farther.&rdquo; &ldquo;<i>Now</i>
will I rise, saith the Lord.&rdquo;</p>

<p>III. <span class="smcap">The desolator desolated.</span></p>

<p><i>Cf.</i> Luke xviii.&nbsp;8; Isa. xlii.&nbsp;1. The
greater wickedness is employed by God
to be the scourge of the less, until its
own time comes to be scattered as
chaff, and destroyed as fire destroys
(vers. 11, 12). To one whose &ldquo;eyes
are in his head,&rdquo; it is sad to hear the
ambassador of Sennacherib saying,
&ldquo;The Lord said unto me, Go up
against this land and destroy it.&rdquo; In
the midst of this judgment of God&mdash;in
which the righteous suffer most&mdash;meted
out instrumentally by wicked
hands, we do well to remember the
words of Christ: &ldquo;Knowest thou
<span class="pagenum" id="p379">[p.&nbsp;379]</span>
not, said Pilate to Him, that I have
power to release thee? Jesus answered,
Thou couldest have no power
at all against Me, except it were given
thee from above.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Note that where the avenging is
pictured in this passage, the two sides
spoken of in the former part of it&mdash;men
and nature&mdash;are summed up in
the terrible destruction of the <i>human.</i>
So terrible is this, that a burning
world is lost sight of! The first
picture of desolation is as nothing to
the second; and the woe is seen to
reach its intensity in this regard.&mdash;<i>J.
Macrae Simcock.</i></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 class="tdc" id="o293"><span class="smcap">A Blessed Life.</span></h3>

<p class="bq">xxxiii.&nbsp;15&ndash;17. <i>He that walketh righteously, &amp;c.</i></p>

<p>This is a gleam of bright sunshine
after a heavy storm. It describes a
truly happy, holy life, such as we may
all attain, and may all well desire to
be ours.</p>

<p>1. It is <i>a gracious life.</i> This is not
especially mentioned here. We have
only what is outward and visible described.
But this always implies an
inward hidden life. When we see
such a great, green, spreading, fruitful
tree of righteousness as this, we may
always assuredly conclude that, deep
in the heart out of sight, there must
be a great, strong, living Lebanon-root
of faith and love (Tit. ii.&nbsp;12). This is
the secret or source of all that follows
(H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I. 2840, 2841, 4092&ndash;4095).</p>

<p>2. It is <i>an upright life.</i> &ldquo;He that
walketh righteously.&rdquo; A man&rsquo;s &ldquo;walk&rdquo;
is his whole conduct in all the positions
and relations in which he stands. <i>All</i>
that this man does is conformed to
the law of God and the example of
Christ (Luke i.&nbsp;6). &ldquo;He speaketh uprightly.&rdquo;
Most important (Jas. iii.&nbsp;2,
i.&nbsp;26; P.&nbsp;D. 3384, 3394). &ldquo;He
despiseth the gain of oppressions.&rdquo; He
will not take advantage of his neighbour&rsquo;s
distress; will not be hard upon
him when his back is at the wall;
will not abuse his ignorance or simplicity
by charging more than a commodity
is worth. &ldquo;He shaketh his
hands from holding of bribes.&rdquo; He
abhors such temptations. Judas, from
an awakened conscience, horror-struck
at what he had done, cast the blood-money
which he had received on the
ground; but this man, from a clear,
enlightened conscience, at peace with
God, casts from him all that would
offend the Lord. &ldquo;He stoppeth his
ears from hearing of blood.&rdquo; There
is a killing of character by slander and
insinuation, but he will have none of
it (P.&nbsp;D. 3108). &ldquo;He shutteth his
eyes from seeing evil.&rdquo; He is like
God; he <i>cannot</i> look upon sin. He
hates it; can find no amusement in
it; knows its tendency and its fearful
end. Through the unguarded eye
comes ruin (Josh. vii.&nbsp;21; 2&nbsp;Sam. xi.&nbsp;2).
Pictures and descriptions of evil often
destroy. Have we not here a beautiful,
noble character? and yet this is
what believing in Christ and walking
in His footsteps will always produce.
But there must be the root, Christ
dwelling in the heart by faith, else the
outward life, however fair and seemly,
will be only a make-believe, a wretched
caricature, that will break down in
the time of trial, and be rejected in
the day of the Lord.</p>

<p>3. It is <i>a heavenly life.</i> &ldquo;He shall
dwell on high.&rdquo; His heart is set on
things above (Eph. ii.&nbsp;5, 6; Col. iii.&nbsp;1&ndash;3;
Phil. iii.&nbsp;20). He has already
come to Zion, the city of the living
God, the heavenly Jerusalem; he
really dwells on high (H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I. 2766&ndash;2779).</p>

<p>4. It is <i>a safe life.</i> His real all is
above, beyond the reach of chance
and change. He is still beset by foes,
but he is safe. &ldquo;His place of defence
is the munitions of rocks&rdquo; (Ps. xviii.&nbsp;2, 3, &amp;c.)</p>

<p>5. It is <i>a well-supplied life.</i> &ldquo;His
bread shall be given him, his water
shall be sure&rdquo; (Ps. xxxiv.&nbsp;10). But
man needs more than bread to eat
and raiment to put on; like the Master,
<span class="pagenum" id="p380">[p.&nbsp;380]</span>
the servant has meat to eat of which
the world knows not (Ps. iv.&nbsp;6, 7,
liii.&nbsp;5, 6). He has growing light, increasing
life, fuller assurance, and fresh
Ebenezers from day to day.</p>

<p>6. It is <i>a hopeful life.</i> &ldquo;Thine eyes
shall see the King in His beauty.&rdquo;
There is a blessed beginning of the
fulfilment of this promise now (John
xiv.&nbsp;21&ndash;23; H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I. 974, 975). &ldquo;They
shall behold the land that is very far
off.&rdquo; To Christ&rsquo;s friends things to
come are revealed by the Holy Ghost.
They see Jesus, already crowned with
glory and honour, and fairer than the
sons of men. Like the patriarchs, they
see the city which hath foundations,
whose builder and maker is God. Like
Moses, they gaze the landscape over
and gird their loins; they take courage
and press on (H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I. 2771&ndash;2779).</p>

<p>Such a life leads to a blessed death.
The two go together. We cannot have
the one without the other. Balaam
thought he could, but it was in vain.
Such a life prepares for a happy meeting
with the Lord, if He should come
while we are still present on the earth
(Matt. xxiv.&nbsp;46).&mdash;<i>John Milne: Gatherings
from a Ministry,</i> pp. 325&ndash;331.</p>

<h3 class="tdc" id="o294"><span class="smcap">The Blessedness of the Servant of God.</span></h3>

<p class="bq">xxxiii.&nbsp;16. <i>He shall dwell on high: his place of defence shall be the munitions of
rocks; bread shall be given him, his water shall be sure.</i></p>

<p>This is part of the answer to the
question proposed in ver. 14. The
overthrow of Asshur has been predicted;
but the judgment of Asshur
is a lesson for Israel as well as for
the heathens. For the sinners in
Jerusalem, there is no abiding in the
presence of the Almighty. They must
repent. &ldquo;God is a consuming fire.&rdquo;
His furnace was in Jerusalem. Therefore
they inquire, &ldquo;Who among us
can dwell with everlasting burnings?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The prophet answers their question
in ver. 15. It is the description of a
God-fearing man from the Old Testament
point of view. Because of the
predominating religion of his heart,
he avoids the sins of his times. A
Christian, in like manner, renounces
sin, and, so far as the world&rsquo;s principles
and practices are sinful, sets
himself against the world. Instead of
being afraid of the Divine anger, as
sinners and hypocrites are, he dwells
in blessed security, with God for his
Friend (ver. 16). Three things distinguish
him from the unbelieving
world: elevation, provision, and security.</p>

<p>I. <span class="smcap">Elevation.</span> &ldquo;He shall dwell
on high.&rdquo; Leaving out of view the
temporal advantages that sometimes
accrue from true religion as being
only incidental, let us look at the
elevation it secures with regard to&mdash;1.&nbsp;<i>Thought.</i>
Christianity directs the
mind to the most elevated themes,
fosters the habit of thought upon
them, and through them refines and
elevates the mind itself. When a
man is converted he generally becomes
interested in topics beyond the
requirements of daily life. Mind
is awakened. Mental activity is required.
In any number of uneducated
men, some Christians and some
not, the Christian section will probably
be the more intelligent and
thoughtful. If an educated man is
converted, the influence is equally
marked. His previous attainments
remain, and his mind receives a new
impetus from the world of spiritual
thought now discovered. He thinks
of God, Christ, redemption, holy influences
on men from on high, the
invisible, heaven, eternity. The mind
cannot fail to be uplifted by contact
with such themes as these. 2.&nbsp;<i>Character.</i>
Doubtless much excellence
exists among men apart for personal
religion. The civil, social, and
commercial virtues are often exemplified
by men who make no pretension
to religion. Even in these respects
the best man without it would be
better with it. But we must rise
higher. Men never rise above their
<span class="pagenum" id="p381">[p.&nbsp;381]</span>
ideal. The ideal of a man without
religion does not rise above his obligations
to man; but the ideal of
a man in Christ is to be like Christ.
It comprehends all dispositions, sympathies,
duties that either look Godward
or manward. It is not yet realised; but
the entertaining and striving towards
it will lift him to a loftier moral attitude
than if his ideal were lower; when
all allowance has been made for human
imperfection, it remains true that
the Christian is, &ldquo;the highest style
of man.&rdquo; 3.&nbsp;<i>Relationship.</i> Believers
are closely connected with Christ,
their Saviour, their Head, their Elder
Brother. They are &ldquo;united to Him,&rdquo;
&ldquo;in Him.&rdquo; Terms are employed that
give the idea, not, indeed, of personal
identity, but of such close relationship
that whatever concerns Him concerns
them, and whatever glorification He
attains they are to share. Through
Him they are &ldquo;the children of God,&rdquo;
and heirs of the celestial inheritance.
Is it possible for relationship to be
loftier? 4.&nbsp;<i>Companionship.</i> The man
is known by his chosen associates.
The young man that keeps low company
makes it plain that his tastes
are low. Fine natures can only enjoy
congenial society. When a man becomes
a Christian, he seeks the society
of Christians. And not only are his
human companionships superior to
those he previously courted, he enjoys
a Divine companionship which is the
supremest dignity. &ldquo;Our fellowship
is with the Father, and with His Son
Jesus Christ.&rdquo; Is it not dwelling &ldquo;on
high&rdquo; to have free access at all times
to the King of kings? 5.&nbsp;<i>Influence.</i>
God has made us kings of men. The
time is coming when the principles
we hold shall, by our means, pervade
the mass of humanity. Already, in a
thousand quiet ways, in families, in
schools, in churches, in populations,
the influence of individual Christian
men is felt to be good and gracious as
far as it extends. Christian fathers
and mothers will live in the recollection
of their children and their children&rsquo;s
children when the memory of
the wicked shall rot (H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I. 1089&ndash;1095).
6.&nbsp;<i>Destiny.</i> He is to be crowned
and enthroned in the abiding glory.
&ldquo;He shall dwell on high&rdquo; (H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I.
1073&ndash;1076, 1106, 1112&ndash;1119).</p>

<p>II. <span class="smcap">Provision.</span> &ldquo;Bread shall be
given him, his water shall be sure.&rdquo;
His wants shall be supplied in his
elevation. All necessary temporal supplies
and spiritual provision. Christ
the bread of life.</p>

<p>III. <span class="smcap">Security.</span> &ldquo;His place of defence
shall be the munitions of rocks.&rdquo;
There is an enemy who would gladly
attack and overcome him; but he has
retired to a place of perfect safety.
Inaccessible to the adversary. Will
endeavour to dislodge you by various
means; such as: 1.&nbsp;<i>Temptation,</i> which
assumes many forms. Grows out of
everything. Keep before you the
lofty ideal; constant effort, watchfulness,
government of thought and
desires, Divine aid. 2.&nbsp;<i>Trouble.</i> It becomes
temptation. It tries faith. Cry
to God. 3.&nbsp;<i>Death.</i> It is the last enemy.
Christ, our defence, will triumph.</p>

Not the world&rsquo;s sins, pleasures, possessions.&mdash;<i>J. Rawlinson.</i></p>

<p class="bq">xxxiii.&nbsp;17. <i>Thine eyes shall see the King in His beauty; they shall behold
the land that is very far off.</i></p>

<p>The literal application of this prophecy
is generally supposed to have
reference to the deliverance of the
Jews from the Assyrian army. They
would then have the joy of seeing
Hezekiah in his goodly apparel, and,
freed from the presence of the invader,
would be left at liberty to enjoy their
own pleasant and goodly land. The
deliverance was accomplished (2&nbsp;Chron.
xxxii.&nbsp;21). But there is another application
of the text&mdash;to the beatific
<span class="pagenum" id="p382">[p.&nbsp;382]</span>
vision of the King of kings in the
heavenly land. Let us then consider&mdash;</p>

<p>I. <span class="smcap">The glorious prospect before

Heb. ii.&nbsp;9; Rev. i.&nbsp;5; 1&nbsp;Tim. vi.&nbsp;10).
Patriarchs and prophets saw Him
in human form. The Jews saw Him
in His humiliation, as &ldquo;a man of sorrows,&rdquo;
&amp;c. The apostles and disciples
saw Him in His risen glory. John
saw Him in the vision of Patmos (Rev.
i.&nbsp;13, &amp;c.). Hereafter all His people
shall see Him &ldquo;in His beauty,&rdquo; in all
His regal splendour and magnificence.
They shall see Him clearly, fully, eternally.
2.&nbsp;<i>The vision of heaven.</i> &ldquo;The
land,&rdquo; &amp;c. Of heaven Canaan was a
type. It was a land of beauty and
abundance; of freedom, after the
slavery of Egypt; of triumph, after
warfare; of rest, after the toils of the
desert. Its crowning distinction was
the Temple, which God filled with His
presence and glory. But heaven is all
temple.</p>

<p>II. <span class="smcap">The certainty of its realisation.</span>
&ldquo;Thine eyes <i>shall,</i>&rdquo; &amp;c. 1.&nbsp;<i>This
was contemplated by Christ in our redemption.</i>
He designed our emancipation
from the dominion of sin, our
deliverance from this present evil
world, and also our elevation to His
glorious kingdom (Heb. ii.&nbsp;10; John
xvii.&nbsp;24). 2.&nbsp;<i>This is repeatedly the subject
of the Divine promises</i> (Luke xxii.&nbsp;29,
xii.&nbsp;32; John xiv.&nbsp;2, 3, &amp;c.).
3.&nbsp;<i>To this tends the work of grace in all its
influence on the soul.</i> See what our
calling is (1&nbsp;Pet. v.&nbsp;10); to what we
are begotten (1&nbsp;Pet. i.&nbsp;3, 4); why we
are sanctified (Rev. iii.&nbsp;4). 4.&nbsp;<i>A goodly
number are now enjoying the fulfilment of
these promises</i> (Rev. vii.&nbsp;9, 14). 5.&nbsp;<i>The
glory and joy of Christ would not be complete
without the eternal salvation of His
people</i> (Isa. liii.&nbsp;11).</p>

<p>III. <span class="smcap">The preparation necessary
for its enjoyment.</span> Nothing is necessary
in the way of merit, price, or self-righteousness.
But if we would see
the King, <i>we must make Him the object
of our believing, affectionate regard now.</i>
If we would see &ldquo;the land,&rdquo; &amp;c.,
<i>we must seek and labour for its attainment</i>
(Heb. xi.&nbsp;16, iv.&nbsp;10).&mdash;<i>Jabez

<h3 class="tdc" id="o296"><span class="smcap">The Beauty of Christ&rsquo;s Character.</span></h3>

<p class="bq">xxxiii.&nbsp;17. <i>Thine eyes shall see the King in His beauty.</i></p>

<p>There is a difference between the
worthiness and the beauty of a character.
A poetic beauty adorns the worth
of Christ&rsquo;s character.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">What are the elements of the
supremely beautiful character of
Christ?</span></p>

<p><b>I. Sensibility.</b> This is a word to
be preferred to sensitiveness, for it
includes sensitiveness; it has the
passive quality of sensitiveness with
activity of soul in addition exercised
upon the impressions received. The
more perfect the manhood, the more
perfect is this sensibility. The total
absence of it is the essence of vulgarity.
The presence of it in its several degrees
endows its possessor, according to the
proportion of it, with what Chaucer
meant by &ldquo;gentilness.&rdquo; 1.&nbsp;It does
not seem wrong to say that there was
in Christ the <i>sensibility to natural beauty.</i>
He also, like us, wished and sought
that Nature should send &ldquo;its own deep
quiet to restore His heart.&rdquo; We find
His common teaching employed about
the vineyard and the wandering sheep,
the whitening corn and the living
well, the summer rain and the wintry
flood and storm. 2.&nbsp;Still higher in
Him was an intense <i>sensibility to human
feeling.</i> He saw Nathaniel coming to
Him, and in a moment frankly granted
the meed of praise (John i.&nbsp;47); when
the malefactor on the cross appealed
to Him, Christ saw at once that the
fountain of a noble life had begun to
flow (Luke xxiii.&nbsp;43). It was the
<span class="pagenum" id="p383">[p.&nbsp;383]</span>
same with bodies of men as with men;
He wove into one instrument of work
the various characters of the Apostles;
day by day He held together vast multitudes
by feeling their hearts within
His own; He shamed and confuted
His enemies by an instinct of their
objections and their whispers; men,
women, and children ran to Him, as a
child to its mother.</p>

<p><i>How did the sensibility of Christ become
active?</i>&mdash;1.&nbsp;<i>As sympathy with
Nature.</i> There are many who never
employ either intellect or imagination
on the impressions which they receive.
Remaining passive, they only permit
the tide of the world&rsquo;s beauty to flow
in and out of their mind; they do
nothing with it. In Wordsworth,
each feeling took form as a poem. As
Christ walked silently along, He lifted
up His eyes and saw the fields whitening
already to harvest; and immediately
He seized on the impression
and expressed it in words. It marks
a beautiful character to be so rapidly
and delicately impressed; but the
beauty becomes vital beauty when,
through sympathy with and love of
what is felt, one becomes himself creative
of new thought. Sometimes such
sympathy is shown <i>through the imagination,</i>
as when Christ, seeing the cornfield
by the shore of the lake while He
was teaching, looked on the whole
career of the field, and combined impressions
taken up by the imagination
into the Parable of the Sower. Sensibility
becoming sympathy is <i>discriminating.</i>
Praise without distinctiveness
is wearisome. We find perfect discrimination
in the illustrations Christ
drew from Nature. How exquisite
the passage beginning, &ldquo;Consider the
lilies!&rdquo; This distinctiveness appears
still more in the choice of places for
certain moods of mind,&mdash;the temptation
in the wilderness, the hill-side
for prayer. In all this, Christ recognises
natural religion as His own, and
bids us believe in its beauty, and add
it to the spiritual. 2.&nbsp;<i>As sympathy with
human feeling.</i> Examples on this are
numerous. His tenderness stayed Him
on the wayside to satisfy the mother&rsquo;s
heart and bless the children;
touched by the widow&rsquo;s weeping, He
gave her back her son. &ldquo;Jesus wept&rdquo;
even at the moment when He was
about to give back the lost, because
those He loved were weeping. How
discriminating the sympathy which
gave to Martha and Mary their several
meed of praise! How unspeakably
beautiful the words, &ldquo;Woman, behold
thy son!&rdquo; Friend, &ldquo;behold thy
mother!&rdquo;</p>

<p>This, then, is loveliness of character.</p>

<p>Remember, we have no right to boast
of our sensibility to the feelings of
others; nay, it is hateful in us till we
lift it into the beauty of sympathising
action. Remember, too, its wise discrimination.
Christ, while feeling with
all the world, sanctified distinctiveness
in friendship and love.</p>

<p><b>II. Simplicity.</b> Milton tells us that
poetry must be &ldquo;simple.&rdquo; The beautiful
character must also possess this
quality. But by simplicity is not
meant here the simplicity of Christ&rsquo;s
teaching. What is meant is the quality
in His character which corresponds to
that which we call simplicity in poetry;
and that which is simplicity in art is
<i>purity</i> in a perfect character. The
beauty of Christ&rsquo;s purity was first in
this, that those who saw it saw in it
the glory of moral victory. His purity
was not the beauty of innocence in a
child; it was purity which had been
subject to the storm, which had known
evil and overcome it. And from this
purity, so tried and victorious, arose
two other elements of moral beauty&mdash;<i>perfect
justice</i> and <i>perfect mercy.</i> Innocence
cannot be just, nor is the untempted
saint fit to judge; but Christ
is able to be just and yet merciful, because
He is entirely pure.</p>

<p><b>III. Passion,</b> defined as the power
of intense feeling capable of perfect
expression. Milton tells us that poetry
must be &ldquo;passionate.&rdquo; We may transfer
it directly to character as an element
of beauty. It was intense feeling
of the weakness and sin of man,
and intense joy in His Father&rsquo;s power
to redeem, that produced the story of
the &ldquo;Prodigal Son.&rdquo; &ldquo;Come unto
<span class="pagenum" id="p384">[p.&nbsp;384]</span>
Me, all ye who are weary and heavy
laden; and I will give you rest.&rdquo; How
that goes home! How deep the passion
which generalised that want into
a single sentence! It is a beauty of
character, whether seen in words or
action, which passes into and assumes
the diadem of sublimity. Christ&rsquo;s
words to the Pharisees have all the
marks of indignation and none of the
marks of anger. Passion and energy
limited by temperance imply <i>repose of
character.</i> Activity in repose, calm in
the heart of passion, these things are
of the essence of beauty. And in
Him in whom we have found the
King in His beauty, this peacefulness
was profound. This is the final touch
of beauty, which gathers into itself
and harmonises all the others, and
hence no words are so beautiful as
those in which Christ bestows it as
His dying legacy on men, &ldquo;Peace I
leave with you,&rdquo; and repeats it as His
resurrection gift, &ldquo;Peace be unto you.&rdquo;
All moral and spiritual loveliness lies
in knowing what He meant when He
said, &ldquo;Come unto Me&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and I will
give you rest.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Rev. Stopford A.

<h3 class="tdc" id="o297"><span class="smcap">Characteristics of the Church of Christ.</span></h3>

<p class="bq">xxxiii.&nbsp;20. <i>Look upon Zion, &amp;c.</i></p>

<p>It is probable that when this
prophecy was delivered the city of
Jerusalem was threatened with an
immediate siege; but Jehovah engages
to defend it from the attacks of its
enemies, the Assyrians, and to render
it at once quiet and secure. But yet
the text appears to have a direct
reference to the privileges and stability
of the Gospel Church, for
Jerusalem, after this period, was
never long preserved from hostile
invasions; therefore our attention is
turned from it to that glorious city
against which the gates of hell shall
never prevail. (See <a href="#o181"><span class="smcap">The Duty of Gladness</span></a> pp. 228, 229.)</p>

<p>I. The Church of Christ is &ldquo;the
city of our solemnities.&rdquo; Jerusalem
was thus described because of the
solemn assemblies that were there
held, the solemn feasts that were
there celebrated, and the solemn sacrifices
that were there offered. And
it is in the Church that individual
believers come together, and unite in
the enjoyment of Divine grace, and in
the presentation of &ldquo;sacrifices&rdquo; with
which &ldquo;God is well pleased&rdquo; (Heb.
xiii.&nbsp;15, <span class="wsnw">16).<a id="o297_fna1" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#o297_fn1">[1]</a></span></p>

<p>II. The Church of Christ is &ldquo;a
quiet <span class="wsnw">habitation.&rdquo;<a id="o297_fna2" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#o297_fn2">[2]</a></span>
All genuine believers
dwell in it, and peace is at
once the bequest of Christ (John xiv.&nbsp;27)
and the fruit of the Spirit (Gal.
v.&nbsp;22).</p>

<p>III. The Church of Christ is &ldquo;a
tabernacle that shall not be taken
down.&rdquo; &ldquo;A tabernacle&rdquo; in contrast
with the superior glories of the New
Jerusalem in heaven. A tabernacle,
because it may often change its place,
as in fact it has already done. But it
shall never be &ldquo;taken down&rdquo; in the
sense of being destroyed (H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I.
1246&ndash;1251).</p>

<p>IV. Such a contemplation of Zion
as our text calls for will awaken&mdash;1.&nbsp;In
<i>angels</i> complacency and delight;
2.&nbsp;In <i>sinners</i> astonishment at its wondrous
preservation, in spite of all their efforts
to destroy it, and desire to share in
its privileges; and 3.&nbsp;In <i>Christians</i>
wonder, love, and praise.&mdash;<i>Thomas
Spencer: Twenty-one Sermons,</i> pp. 196&ndash;206.</p>

<p class="bq">xxxiii.&nbsp;21. <i>But there the glorious Lord shall be unto us a place of broad rivers and
streams; wherein shall go no galley with any oars, neither shall gallant ship pass
thereby.</i></p>

<p>The prophet here speaks for the
encouragement of God&rsquo;s Church; and
he appears to overstep the boundaries
of time, and gives a glimpse of the
blessedness and safety of the Church
triumphant. In our interpretation let
us take a large view, and refer, as the
course of thought may require, both
to the Church militant and the Church
triumphant. And let it be deeply
impressed on the mind that the promises
of God can be realised only by
those who belong to the true Israel.</p>

<p>I. <span class="smcap">The attractive title proclaimed.</span>
&ldquo;The glorious Lord.&rdquo; God
is glorious in His own perfections,
and as the source of all the glory and
beauty in this and every other world.
Our knowledge of God is gathered
from His manifestations in <i>nature</i> and
<i>revelation.</i> How resplendent in glory
is the Being thus revealed to us!
Especially we may say, with immediate
reference to our subject, He is
glorious in the vastness of His resources.
In the summer the streams
of the Holy Land were either entirely
dried up, and converted into hot lanes
of glaring sands, or reduced to narrow
streamlets. But no summer&rsquo;s heat can
dry up the broad streams of Divine
love and mercy. God is glorious in
the abundant nature of His supplies,
and in His willingness to make ample
provision for His Church.</p>

<p>II. <span class="smcap">The blessed comparison instituted.</span>
&ldquo;The glorious Lord shall
be unto us a place of broad rivers and
streams.&rdquo; That is, all that such rivers
and streams are to a country, God
would be to His people. 1.&nbsp;<i>Broad
rivers and streams give beauty to the landscape.</i>
All beauty is from God, and
it is a revelation of Him; but especially
is it true that He is the source of all
the moral beauty of His people.
2.&nbsp;<i>Broad rivers give fertility and prosperity.</i>
In such a highly cultivated country as
England, where great droughts are
unknown, we have no opportunity of
properly observing the fertilising influence
of a broad river. But remember
what the Nile is to Egypt. So
does God enrich and fertilise the soul,
causing it to bring forth &ldquo;the fruits
of righteousness.&rdquo; 3.&nbsp;<i>Broad rivers
afford protection.</i> Babylon had its
Euphrates, which was a source of
power. &ldquo;Hundred-gated Thebes,&rdquo;
celebrated by Homer, also had its
river. Almost all great modern cities
are built upon the banks of rivers. But
Jerusalem had no great river running
through it. In fact, it was badly supplied
with water. Large cisterns were
constructed in which to catch and preserve
the rain that came down plentifully
in its season. The prophet makes
use of this fact for the encouragement
of the Church. The glorious Lord will
be unto it as broad rivers and streams.
He is the sure defence of His people.</p>

<p>III. <span class="smcap">The distinctive mark of
Divine blessings here symbolised.</span>
&ldquo;Wherein shall go no galley with
oars, neither shall gallant ship pass
thereby.&rdquo; Earthly blessings have
attendant evils; heavenly blessings
alone are pure and perfect. Rivers
may prove a source of weakness as
well as strength to a <span class="wsnw">nation.<a id="o298_fna1" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#o298_fn1">[1]</a></span>
But along the broad rivers of Divine
blessing no foe shall advance to assail
God&rsquo;s people. The presence of God
at once confers blessings and averts
evils.&mdash;<i>W. Burrows, B.A.</i></p>

Rivers are highly important as the
outlets and inlets of commercial enterprise;
but the merchant ship, though richly laden,
may carry the seeds of physical and moral
disease, and inflict untold injury. Rivers give
security to the cities built on their banks, but
they may also prove the means of destruction.
Cyrus made use of the Euphrates when besieging
Babylon, and thus captured the city. The
strength of Babylon became its weakness.
The same river that bears on its tidal waves
<span class="pagenum" id="p386">[p.&nbsp;386]</span>
the merchant ship laden with the precious
produce of distant lands may also bring the
war-ship laden with the instruments of destruction
and death. But the city of our
solemnities is secure. No mischief can come
to us along the broad river of Almighty grace.&mdash;<i>Burrows.</i></p>

<h3 class="tdc" id="o299"><span class="smcap">A Controlling Fact.</span></h3>

<p class="bq">xxxiii.&nbsp;22. <i>The Lord is our Judge.</i></p>

<p>An immense step has been taken in
the moral development of any one
who has been led to say this with the
understanding, with a vivid perception
of the truth of this declaration.</p>

<p><b>I. It is a fact that God is our
Judge.</b> The Bible teaches us&mdash;1.&nbsp;That
God is continually present with us,
intimately acquainted with our real
characters, the witness of all our
actions, words, and thoughts (Prov. v.&nbsp;21,
xv.&nbsp;3; Job xxxi.&nbsp;4; Ps. xi.&nbsp;4, cxxi.&nbsp;1&ndash;7).
Thus He is qualified for being
in an eminent sense our judge.
2.&nbsp;That the God who is perfectly acquainted
with all our dispositions and
actions cannot behold any one of
them with indifference. He observes
them on purpose to estimate their
real nature; He necessarily approves
or disapproves of them. It is this
that renders His knowledge of them
important. He not only is pure from
all moral evil, but He holds it in
abomination; He not only is perfect
in all moral goodness, but He loves
goodness (Hab. i.&nbsp;12, 13; Jer. ix.&nbsp;24;
Ps. v.&nbsp;4&ndash;6, xi.&nbsp;7, xxxvii.&nbsp;23).
3.&nbsp;That this omniscient and holy God is
our proper and righteous Governor.
This brings His approbation and disapprobation
home to us; it implies
that they will be attended with the
weightiest consequences. All that
men can do often is merely to esteem
or to blame us. If they have authority
over us, or are able to promote or
obstruct our interest, their opinion of
our character assumes a new importance
(Prov. xix.&nbsp;12). Honour or dishonour
in the eye of the All-perfect
Being is for its own sake deeply affecting
to every ingenuous mind; but to
the soul of every man not dead to
thought it must, on account of its inevitable
and infinite consequence, appear
of infinite importance. God is
the Sovereign and the moral Governor
of mankind, and His approbation will
be followed by a great reward, His
disapprobation by a dreadful punishment
(Ps. xlvii.&nbsp;2, 8; Jer. xvii.&nbsp;10;
Eccl. iii.&nbsp;17, xii.&nbsp;14). Our conscience
testifies that this should be the case.
And our redemption by Jesus Christ,
which displays the marvellous grace
and compassion of God, displays at
the same time, in the most striking
manner, the inevitable sanctity of His
government of mankind. While it provides
for the pardon of sin, the blood
of Christ, shed for the expiation of sin,
testifies how odious, how deserving of
punishment it is in the sight of God.
While it secures mercy to the penitent,
it seals the condemnation and the
misery of every sinner.</p>

<p><b>II. A recognition of the fact that
God is our Judge will necessarily exert
a controlling influence upon us.</b> We
are greatly influenced by the judgment
passed upon our character and conduct
by our fellow-men, especially if they
are discerning and virtuous, and still
more if their good or bad opinion is
likely to be of advantage or disadvantage
to us. What, then, must be the
effect upon any man who really wakes
up to the fact that we are under the
scrutiny of One who alone can justly
estimate our character, and whose estimation
of it is of infinite importance
to us! To be approved and beloved,
or to be disapproved and hated by the
Ruler of the universe! It is in one of
these conditions that each of us stands
to-day. Disapprobation from God is
the extremity of disgrace and misery;
approbation of Him is the summit
of honour and happiness: the former
is the natural object of fear, sorrow,
and shame, exciting to circumspect
<span class="pagenum" id="p387">[p.&nbsp;387]</span>
avoidance of it; the latter of ardent
desire, elevating hope, and rapturous
joy, conspiring to animate us in eager
pursuit of it.</p>

<p>1. The unpardoned man cannot remember
that &ldquo;the Lord is our Judge&rdquo;
without <i>fear.</i> Thoughts of His nearness,
His omniscience, His omnipotence,
and His hatred of all sin fill him
with alarm. Along with this fear
there springs up within him <i>sorrow.</i>
The sinner who has become conscious
of the discriminating eye of perfect
sanctity marking all his paths, mourns
for his sins and is troubled. His spirit
is broken, his heart is contrite. He
sorrows to repentance (2&nbsp;Cor. vii.&nbsp;9).
To the sorrow is added <i>shame.</i> Whatever
brings a stain upon our character
in the estimation of our fellow-men
naturally produces shame and humiliation.
To be detected in what is base
confounds most men, even though no
further inconvenience is apprehended.
To be lost to shame is the last sign
of degeneracy; but to deserve blame
from God is the deepest ignominy; it
must cover with confusion every man
who has any sense of God (Dan. ix.&nbsp;8;
Luke xviii.&nbsp;13).</p>

<p>2. The fear, sorrow, and humiliation
which arise in sinful men immediately
they remember the holy government
which God exercises over them continually,
influence those also who are
conscious that for Christ&rsquo;s sake He
has forgiven them. They cause them
to proceed through life with unremitted
caution; to exercise steady care
in avoiding every transgression and
every omission displeasing to God.
They constrain them to walk humbly
with Him, and produce in them that
modesty, diffidence, lowliness, and
sober-mindedness which adorn their
character. But these are not the only
results of their constant remembrance
that &ldquo;the Lord is our Judge.&rdquo;
(1.)&nbsp;Recognising that His approbation is
the sublimest honour, they are inspired
with an ardent desire to secure it.
That desire gives a direction to their
whole conduct (Ps. iv.&nbsp;6; Col. i.&nbsp;10;
2&nbsp;Cor. v.&nbsp;9). (2.)&nbsp;Conscious that,
through Christ, they are the happy
objects of God&rsquo;s favour, the hope of
its continuance throughout eternity
produces within them a triumphant
joy (Rom. viii.&nbsp;16, 17; Prov. x.&nbsp;28).
The all-penetrating eye of God, so
terrible to the sinner, is become to the
man who feels himself approved in
His sight the encouraging, the exhilarating
eye of his Father and Friend.
This renders duty delightful, comforts
in sorrow, takes away all fear in
death.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Concluding Observations.</span>&mdash;1.&nbsp;A
remembrance that &ldquo;the Lord is our
Judge&rdquo; will deliver us from bondage
to the opinions of our fellow-men.
While naturally desirous of their approval,
every corrupt fashion presuming
to authorise what God disapproves
or to explode what He approves will
be counted but the silly caprice of
fools. If every sensible man prefers
the esteem of a few able judges to the
applauses of an ignorant multitude, he
must be as destitute of good sense as
of religion who can hesitate in preferring
honour from God to the good
opinion of the whole universe. 2.&nbsp;All
the present pleasures and advantages
which sin can offer will be unable to
seduce the man who preserves a lively
sense of the Heavenly Judge, for they
bear no proportion either to the happiness
which accompanies His approbation,
or to the misery which arises
from His wrath (Matt. xvi.&nbsp;26, 27).
All the losses, troubles, and perils to
which virtue can expose him will not
have power to terrify him from the
love and practice of it (Rom. viii.&nbsp;18).
Conscious that he is observed by God,
animated by the sense of his acting his
part before so august a Presence, he
will exert all the powers of his soul to
act it well. In the exertion he will
feel a noble expansion of heart, and
triumph in the hope of being approved
and rewarded, and his hope shall not
be disappointed, for its largest promises
shall be surpassed by the greatness
of his reward.&mdash;<i>Alexander Gerard,

<p class="bq">xxxiii.&nbsp;22. <i>For the Lord is our Judge; the Lord is our Lawgiver, &amp;c.</i></p>

<p>There are here two propositions,
the one affirming that Jehovah sustains
a certain relationship to us, the
other declaring that in that relationship,
and therefore in a manner perfectly
consistent with it, He will save
us. The same thing substantially is
repeatedly asserted in the Scriptures.
The very prophet in whose writings
these words occur elsewhere speaks
thus in God&rsquo;s name: &ldquo;There is no
God else beside me, a just God and a
Saviour; there is none beside&rdquo; (xlv.&nbsp;21);
&ldquo;I bring near my righteousness,
my salvation shall not tarry&rdquo; (xlvi.&nbsp;13);
&ldquo;My righteousness is near, my
salvation is gone forth&rdquo; (li.&nbsp;5). All
this has been translated into New
Testament language in that remarkable
utterance of Paul&rsquo;s, &ldquo;Christ
Jesus, whom God hath set forth to
be a propitiation through faith in His
blood, to declare His righteousness,
that He might be just, and the justifier
of him who believeth in Jesus&rdquo; (Rom.
iii.&nbsp;25, 26).</p>

<p>Let us endeavour to unfold the
harmony of salvation with the law,
the justice, and the royalty of God.</p>

<p><b>I. Let us look at the relationship
indicated by the three terms Judge,
Lawgiver, and King.</b> We say relationship,
for although the words are
three, the thing is substantially one,
each term giving us only a modification
of the same idea. The judge is
the king on the bench, the lawgiver is
the king writing the statute-book, and
the king is the judge and lawgiver on
the throne of government. The three
things so run into each other that it is
difficult to keep them distinct, each of
the three terms brings before us one
distinct phasis of the governmental relationship
which God sustains towards
us. The judge is set to see that the
guilty shall not escape, and that the
innocent shall not be punished; the
lawgiver has to secure that the majesty
of the law is upheld, and its authority
recognised; and the king has to take
care that the best interests of his subjects
as a whole are not interfered
with but advanced. Now it is here
affirmed that Jehovah stands to us in
this threefold relation, and that as a
judge He saves us criminals, as a lawgiver
He forgives us law-breakers, as
a king He pardons us rebels.</p>

<p>We are not denying that God is
willing and anxious to show Himself
as a <i>father,</i> even to sinners. Our
affirmation is, that <i>now,</i> when man
has sinned, if God is to be to him
precisely as He was before, if the
liberty of God&rsquo;s Son is to be enjoyed
by him, then some means must be
taken to secure that in all this no dishonour
shall be put upon the law of
God, no blot be made upon His judicial
character, and no peril result to His
throne or the interests of His holy
subjects.</p>

<p><b>II. The means by which God the
Judge, Lawgiver, and King saves
man.</b> If we take the Scriptures for
our guide, the answer will not be
difficult to discover, for we are there
uniformly taught that God seeks to
save us through a substitute. At first
this principle was revealed through
animal sacrifices, then through the
more definite offerings of the Mosaic
institute, and then through the still
more definite teachings of the inspired
prophets. The high priest laid his
hand upon the head of his victim,
confessed over it all his iniquities and
all the sins of all the people, and it
was to bear their iniquity. But in
the remarkable oracle contained in
Isaiah liii. the very same phraseology
is used in reference to the expected
Messiah; for we are there told that
God &ldquo;hath laid upon Him the iniquity
of us all,&rdquo; that &ldquo;He was wounded for
our transgressions, and bruised for our
iniquities,&rdquo; and that &ldquo;He shall bear
our iniquities.&rdquo; To this corresponds
the language of the New Testament;
<span class="pagenum" id="p389">[p.&nbsp;389]</span>
for when John the Baptist pointed
out the Messiah, he said, &ldquo;Behold the
Lamb of God that taketh (beareth)
away the sins of the world;&rdquo; and Jesus
Himself declared that &ldquo;the Son of
man came to give His life a ransom for
many,&rdquo; and that &ldquo;the good shepherd
giveth his life for the sheep.&rdquo; And in
perfect harmony with all this are the
utterances of the Apostles. It seems
perfectly clear that the principle of
substitution is the very thread round
which all the other declarations of the
Scripture crystallise. The Bible, from
its beginning to its close, is &ldquo;dipped
in blood;&rdquo; the atoning death of Christ
is the foundation on which its whole
system rests, and if that be rejected,
the whole book must go with it as a
dead and worthless thing.</p>

<p><b>III. Is this arrangement in harmony
with the regal and judicial
character of God?</b> Gathering up the
scattered statements of the Word of
God into one systematic treatment of
this subject, it seems clear that the
following things need to be secured in
order that substitution may harmonise
with and subserve the ends of justice:&mdash;1.&nbsp;<i>That
the substitute shall be himself
free from all taint of sin, and be a
voluntary victim.</i> Christ was &ldquo;holy,
harmless, undefiled, and separate from
sinners&rdquo; as He was God-Man, and did
not need to put Himself under the law
except He had chosen to be the
sinner&rsquo;s friend. He is thus qualified
to be our substitute. And there was
no compulsion. &ldquo;Lo, I come! I delight
to do Thy will, O my God.&rdquo;
2.&nbsp;<i>That the sacrifice he offers be of such value
as to preserve the majesty of the law, and
cover the case of those for whom it was
designed.</i> The sacrifice offered must
be something which the person making
it can call his own property;
and it must be something which is in
itself adequate to the end contemplated.
This is precisely what we
have in the case of Christ. He could
say His life was His own, for He was
God as well as man. Again, it was
such a sacrifice as met the case, for it
was offered in the person of a Divine
Man. As God-man, He infinitely
transcends all other men, and therefore,
when standing as a substitute,
His personal dignity and worth give
infinite value to His substitution.
3.&nbsp;<i>That the persons set free thereby
should be so changed in character that
their after conduct shall not in any way
interfere with or interrupt the happiness
of God&rsquo;s other holy children and subjects.</i>
This is secured in connection with
Christ&rsquo;s work; for when, by the eye
of faith, the love of Jesus is seen as
manifested on the cross, its power is
such that it constrains the sinner to live
to Him who loved him and gave Himself
for him. The criminal who is pardoned
through faith in the substitution
of Christ is also reformed, and no detriment
results from his deliverance to
the other citizens of Jehovah&rsquo;s empire.
4.&nbsp;<i>That the substitute himself have such
compensation given him, that in the end
he shall not lose, but rather gain, through
the sacrifice He has made.</i> Even although
a substitute should willingly
offer himself, it would be injustice to
allow him to suffer if no adequate
return could be made for it. Christ
received as the reward of His sufferings
that which is by Himself admitted
and declared to be a thoroughly
satisfactory recompense for the sacrifice
he made. As He sees of the
travail of His soul, He is satisfied.
5.&nbsp;<i>That the substitute be accepted by
both parties.</i> That He is accepted by
God is evident from the resurrection
of Christ from the dead, His ascension
into heaven, and the outpouring of
the Holy Spirit; and He becomes
accepted by the sinner when he believes
in Jesus. Christ is not my
substitute until I accept Him as such.</p>

<p>Two remarks in conclusion:&mdash;1.&nbsp;It
follows that Jesus Christ is an all-sufficient
Saviour. His work is such
that any sinner choosing to avail himself
of it may be saved through it.
2.&nbsp;It also follows that Jesus Christ is
the only Saviour; for if these requirements
needed to be satisfied,
who is there that can meet them but
Himself?&mdash;<i>W.&nbsp;M. Taylor, D.D.: Life
Truths,</i> pp. 1&ndash;20.</p>

<h3 class="tdc" id="o301"><span class="smcap">The Disabled Ship.</span></h3>

<p class="tdc">(<i>A Sermon to Seamen.</i>)</p>

<p class="bq">xxxiii.&nbsp;23. <i>Thy tacklings are loosed, &amp;c.</i></p>

<p>Seas, rivers, and ships have for ages
afforded the world the mainstay of
commerce. Not only so; the imagery
of many of our best books would have
been very much the poorer had not
visions and dreams of the sea been present
to the writers. Isaiah makes good
use of these. In ver. 21 he says,
&ldquo;The glorious Lord will be unto us a
place of broad rivers and streams,&rdquo; &amp;c.
Jerusalem was badly off, compared
with Babylon and other cities, in that
it had neither sea nor river, but only
a small rivulet. Large and deep rivers
near great towns have their advantages
and disadvantages in time of war.
The prophet here says that God would
be to Jerusalem a place of broad rivers
and streams, wherein no ship of war
should be allowed to approach to injure
His people. It is better to trust in the
Lord than to put confidence in seas or
war-ships. (ver. 22).</p>

<p>Jerusalem, at the time, was in danger
from a great power, and in the text
that power, Assyria, is compared to a
ship whose &ldquo;tacklings are loosed,&rdquo; &amp;c.
A sad plight surely for a ship to be in!
But not only great powers like Assyria
are, in reality, in a bad way, as
abettors of wickedness, but individuals
also, like the disabled vessel spoken of
by the prophet; for, 1.&nbsp;<i>A wicked man
is like a ship whose tacklings are loosed.</i>
The tackle of a ship is of immense service
in many ways; but a ship whose
tackle has got loosed from her masts
is not fit for a voyage. No seaman
would dream of sailing in such a ship.
Every rope must be in its right place
and securely fixed. But how many
men are out on the voyage of life, with
the gear of mind and heart all loose!
In fine weather, even, they make no real
headway; in storms they are in peril
of being cast away. They are at the
mercy of every wind that blows; for,
2.&nbsp;<i>A wicked man is like a ship whose
masts will not stand upright.</i> The tackle
of a ship is of service in strengthening
its masts. But men are out voyaging
on the sea of life: they would fain
stand upright, but they cannot; for
their thoughts and feelings are not
made use of to sustain them in an upright
life; they sway under the blast;
the crash of ruin is always impending.
3.&nbsp;<i>A wicked man is like a ship without
sails.</i> On a mast, unstrengthened by
good tackle, it is worse than useless to
attempt to spread a sail. But without
sails to catch the heaven-sent breezes,
how shall the distant haven be reached?
Even men of some moral ballast are
at best like poor toilers at the oars.
The port is a long way off, and they
need sails&mdash;wings filled with spiritual
energies&mdash;to carry them onward over
miles of sea day by day. 4.&nbsp;<i>A wicked
man is like a dismantled ship which plunderers
attack.</i> &ldquo;Then is the prey of a
great spoil divided; the lame take the
prey.&rdquo; How poor sailors are plundered
by the weakest of mankind and womankind!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Conclusion.</span>&mdash;Sin, iniquity, that is
<i>in-equity,</i> is at the root of the godless
man&rsquo;s loose thoughts and passions, tottering
steps and wingless spirit. The
ship wants a thorough overhauling;
nay, it wants remaking (John iii.&nbsp;3).</p>

<p>We should be homeward-bound for
the kingdom of God; but it is vain to
dream of reaching port as an unseaworthy
vessel.&mdash;<i>J. Macrae Simcock.</i></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 class="tdc" id="o302"><span class="smcap">No Sickness There.</span></h3>

<p class="bq">xxxiii.&nbsp;24. <i>And the inhabitant shall not say, I am sick.</i></p>

<p>In a besieged city, from watching,
anxiety, and scarcity of food, there is
usually considerable sickness. When
an epidemic disease is prevalent, sickness
<span class="pagenum" id="p391">[p.&nbsp;391]</span>
becomes the general experience.
There is in any large population always
a considerable amount of sickness,
more or less serious. Nor is it
confined to the city. In the country
it is much the same. At the best it
is only somewhat less. Medical men
are everywhere required. Sanitary
arrangements, temperate habits, and
medical skill may diminish the extent
and alleviate the severity of sickness,
but they cannot uproot it. When,
therefore, we read of a city in which
there shall be no sickness, our thoughts
turn from earth to heaven. The text
is a beautifully poetic representation
of the termination of the conscious
weakness that rested on Jerusalem
while the Assyrian army lay before it.
But there is a sense in which the
words may be literally understood.
We believe in &ldquo;the holy city, the new
Jerusalem.&rdquo; Let us meditate on that
new condition of our life.</p>

<p><b>I. Sickness is weakness.</b> We give
the name to all states of the body
other than sound and perfect health.
How numerous! Our condition here
is one of constant liability to it. At
every period of life we are exposed to
it. It may be borne to us by the air
we breathe; taken with the food we
eat and the water we drink; received
by contact with our fellows; lurk
secretly in some part of our body
unsuspected; develop itself from the
slight cold, the result of carelessness,
or in spite of the utmost thoughtfulness;
it may attack the youth as well
as the old man, those who boast the
fulness of their strength as well as
those who know themselves to be less
firmly built. But it always supposes
weakness. Under the name of weakness
it holds its victim with a firm
grasp. While he persuades himself
that he has conquered, it secretly
spreads through every vein, and
eventually lays him prostrate. The
strongest man becomes powerless
when sickness holds him in its grasp.
As he is too weak to throw off the
weakness, he is too weak to perform
the tasks which at other times he
performs with perfect ease. The
student, the mechanic, the merchant.
Visit some sick-bed and your confidence
of perpetual strength will depart.
Sickness is humiliating because
it is weakening. It is often attended
with pain. Pain increases weakness.
In the grasp of pain the sufferer may
be held for days, with no power of
resistance, no prospect of relief.</p>

<p>Have you not sometimes thought
what a contrast it would be if you
could be entirely free from sickness
and from liability to it? We may
indulge the thought. That will be
the condition of the resurrection
body in the celestial city. It will be
fashioned like to the body of Christ&rsquo;s
glory (1&nbsp;Cor. xv.&nbsp;42&ndash;44). As Christ
on the cross endured the last sickness
and pain He was ever to know, so
shall all His followers rise, as He did,
to a life from which sickness and pain
are for ever excluded. Are you one
with Him? Then in pain, weariness,
languor, sickness, let all impatience
be subdued as you remember that it
is only a little longer. &ldquo;Neither shall
there be any more pain.&rdquo;</p>

<p><b>II. Sickness is sorrow.</b> Sorrow
because of lost time and business, fear
that the end of life is near, the leaving
behind not only all pleasant
earthly things and persons, but especially
those dependent on the patient&rsquo;s
life, to whom his loss may be ruin.
Not to the patient only is it a time
of sorrow. Enter the house. All
is gloom. Rooms darkened. The
family tread softly and speak under
their breath, as if every sound would
not only disturb the sufferer, but be
out of harmony with their own feelings.
It is the little one that has
come home sick from school (2&nbsp;Kings
iv.&nbsp;19). His mother takes him on
her knee. Soon she perceives the
signs of one of the sicknesses that are
the terror of childhood. Medical aid
is procured. The sickness deepens.
Every one watches with aching heart,
for the child is a universal favourite.
And if he is taken, oh, what distress!
Or it is the young man who has grown
to maturity. He is active in business.
His father, under the burden of advancing
<span class="pagenum" id="p392">[p.&nbsp;392]</span>
years, is gradually devolving
responsibility on him, that he may
himself enjoy a few years&rsquo; rest after a
life of hard and anxious work. But
sickness comes. It passes by those
you would expect it to strike. It
singles out the young and strong.
Gradually that fine young man wastes
away. Day and night the mother,
whose advancing years and infirmities
demand the attention, watches over
him with a breaking heart. All is
done that strong affection can inspire.
It is vain. Oh! what sorrow through
these months! And when the end
comes, what tongue can describe the
agony?</p>

<p>We wonder if it will ever cease to be
true that &ldquo;man was made to mourn.&rdquo;
Thank God we can entertain the prospect
of the complete cessation of sorrow.
&ldquo;Neither sorrow.&rdquo; &ldquo;Sorrow and
sighing shall flee away.&rdquo; &ldquo;God shall
wipe away all tears from their eyes.&rdquo;
For &ldquo;the inhabitant shall not say, I
am sick.&rdquo;</p>

<p><b>III. Sickness is the prelude to
death.</b> It usually precedes. Any
sickness may end in it. Death changes
everything; the body different; the
soul different. But there shall be no
more death. There will be the perpetuated
life of paradise regained;
for there will be the tree of life;
there will be the resurrection body
(1&nbsp;Cor. xv.&nbsp;53, 54).</p>

<p><b>IV. Sickness, sorrow, and death are
the fruit of sin.</b> Does not Scripture
thus trace them? There was no sickness
before sin. Sin was the seed.
The heavenly city is free from sin.
There is perfect holiness. It is the
completion of the redeeming work of
Christ from sin, sorrow, death. The
seed which bears sickness is taken out
of the soil.</p>

<p>Shall we dwell in that city of immortal
health? Are we travelling
towards it? If not, we cannot reach
it. Jesus is the way. Come to Him
(Rev. xxi.&nbsp;27). It is a prepared place
for a prepared people.&mdash;<i>J. Rawlinson.</i></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 class="tdc" id="o303"><span class="smcap">Recovery from Sickness.</span></h3>

<p class="tdc">(<i>Sermon to the Young.</i>)</p>

<p class="bq">xxxiii.&nbsp;24. <i>And the inhabitant shall not say, I am sick.</i></p>

<p>Our sun-dial is not that of Hezekiah:
its shadow has no backward
movement; the last enemy must soon
challenge the traveller to pay the tax
imposed on his pilgrimage. When all
the pains and illnesses of the flesh are
over, there remaineth a place purchased,
prepared, and furnished for the
children of God, and in which &ldquo;the
inhabitant shall not say, I am sick.&rdquo;
Where is this healthy spot? Not in
any place in this country; not in the
world of which our land is so favoured
a portion. To be able always to say,
&ldquo;I am not sick,&rdquo; is one of the privileges
of heaven alone.</p>

<p>I. <span class="smcap">The evils and disagreeables
of sickness.</span></p>

<p>Sickness is certainly not a pleasant
thing&mdash;necessary, profitable, if you
please, but not pleasant. It cannot
be pleasant; for it is the punishment
for sin. Angels are never sick, because
they are of that world of which the
inhabitant shall not say, &ldquo;I am sick.&rdquo;
Sickness helps to crumble us into
death; diseases are Death&rsquo;s servants.
Death sends them out in their different
liveries as his couriers and forerunners;
they apprise sinners that their
Master is coming into their country,
passing by that way, will perhaps
&ldquo;stand at their door and knock,&rdquo; warning
each to be ready to leave all and
follow death, as Peter said he and his
fellow-apostles had done for Christ
(H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I. 1561).</p>

<p>1. Bodily pain often accompanies
sickness. This is sometimes felt in so
grievous and dreadful a degree that
the sufferer wishes and prays for death
to be relieved of his agonies. When
David was tried in this way he said,
&ldquo;The pains of hell gat hold upon me&rdquo;&mdash;a
strong expression, meaning very
excruciating pains. Who can tell but
those who have felt them what sufferings
belong to the burning fever, the
<span class="pagenum" id="p393">[p.&nbsp;393]</span>
tormenting headache, &amp;c.? The curious
machine is out of order; the wheels
grind and grate against each other;
&ldquo;the harp with a thousand strings is
out of tune and full of discords.&rdquo; The
very means taken for recovery often,
for a time at least, increase pain and
suffering. We admire the wisdom
which God has given to man to discover
the healing virtues concealed in
Nature&rsquo;s works. But most of these,
excellent in their effects, are nauseous
to the taste. It seems as if Providence
had ordained this on purpose that
everything should conspire in sickness
to make it a suffering, uncomfortable
time, in order the more deeply to impress
on us the salutary lessons it is
intended to teach us.</p>

<p>2. The interruption it causes to the
active duties of life. Health is the
one thing needful, not only to the
enjoyment of life, but to the vigorous
and successful discharge of the duties.</p>

<p>3. One might mention a third evil,
viz., the trouble one gives in sickness
to those around us, only you might be
ready to cry out, &ldquo;We cannot allow
this to be either a trouble or an evil;
what sister or affectionate brother
would think this a trouble?&rdquo; But
often the sufferer feels it keenly.</p>

<p>II. <span class="smcap">The profits and advantages
of sickness.</span></p>

<p>Begin by thanking Jesus Christ
that sickness it not a punishment and
nothing else&mdash;not a certainty and foretaste
of hell. His sacrifice has taken
away its sting; it bears the peaceable
fruits of righteousness to them that
are exercised thereby. It withdraws
us from the world. We follow too
hotly and incessantly the things of the
world. Some years ago a satire was
written upon us called &ldquo;The World
Without Souls,&rdquo; and the author, without
exaggerating, nearly proved that
most of us live as if we thought this
was really to be the case.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Conclusion.</span>&mdash;So improve the sickness
of earth as to make it the path to
the health of heaven. In health often
look back to the time of sickness;
consider what were then your feelings,
your fears, your good resolutions.
Have you kept your word? Have you
done your part? Is the Great Physician
paid? He seeks not gold, but the
coin of gratitude, love, and obedience.
Every sickness should urge us to secure
the country without pain; to win the
new heavens and the new earth in
which Christ&rsquo;s redeemed people shall
be crowned with unfading youth and
unbroken health.&mdash;<i>George Clark, M.A.:

<h3 class="tdc" id="o304"><span class="smcap">The Controversy of Zion.</span></h3>

<p class="bq">xxxiv.&nbsp;8. <i>For it is the day of the Lord&rsquo;s vengeance, &amp;c.</i></p>

<p>The Lord has always been mindful
of His Church. He is pledged to her
defence against the world, and against
the world-spirit which often intrudes
within her pale. Chapter xxxiv. contains
a description of the effects of the
Divine vengeance in the typical case
of Edom; chapter xxxv. describes the
flourishing state of the Church consequent
upon the execution of the Divine
judgments.</p>

<p><b>I. There is a parallel between God&rsquo;s
dealings with individuals and society.</b>
Such a parallel may be presumed to
exist, inasmuch as any society is made
up of individuals; and God cares
equally for the single and the corporate
life. Taking the mass of men,
evil dispositions lead to evil deeds, and
these to habits, before they are turned
to the service of God. God intervenes
in the way of judgment; times of
judgment are appointed them, foreshadowing
a future day of the Lord&rsquo;s
vengeance. 1.&nbsp;<i>Individual judgments.</i>
God&rsquo;s controversy with Jacob at Peniel,
when Jacob&rsquo;s thigh was put out of
joint, was but the climax of the Divine
vengeance in respect of his sinful past,
and became the <i>turning-point</i> of his
life. Not only are bad men changed
in this way, but good men are made
better (xxxviii.&nbsp;12&ndash;14; Lam. iii.&nbsp;3&ndash;21;
Job x.&nbsp;16&ndash;20; H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I. 56&ndash;59, 66&ndash;70,
116). God strikes, that human nature
may be laid bare in its depths, and a
thorough work of regeneration accomplished,
proceeding from within outward.
<span class="pagenum" id="p394">[p.&nbsp;394]</span>
Afflictions do not always soften;
but they do so often enough to form a
large part of the method of the Divine
vengeance. 2.&nbsp;<i>Social and national
judgments.</i> Jacob became Israel, and
Israel the Church of God, the representative
of God on earth, even as
Edom, of which Esau, the godless, was
the ancestor, is regarded in Scripture
as the representative of the world-power.
Edom was emphatically the
troubler of Israel. Its judgments&mdash;prophetic
of greater in the future&mdash;were
sent by the Defender of Zion&mdash;(1.)&nbsp;To
make manifest its sin; (2.)&nbsp;To
show the theocratic character of Israel.</p>

<p>But the Edom, or world-spirit, was
in Israel herself; hence the judgments
of the Church. The idea of the theocracy
was interfered with when Israel
wished a king, like the other nations
(1&nbsp;Sam. viii.&nbsp;6, 7). That could only
be entertained by Jehovah if kings
had their right to rule direct from
Himself. And so He raised up <i>David
and David&rsquo;s line</i> (1&nbsp;Sam. xvi.&nbsp;1&ndash;13;
Gen. xlix.&nbsp;8). Hence the institution and
perpetuation of the prophetic line&mdash;Samuel,
Isaiah, Ezekiel, &amp;c.&mdash;to assert
and maintain the idea of the theocracy.</p>

<p>With a grander display of the Divine
power this tale has been re-told under
the Christian dispensation. Social and
national crises are still brought about,
in the wise judgment of God, first, to
make manifest the sins of communities
and nations; and, second, to direct men
to the Church of Christ. In times of <i>the
Church&rsquo;s unfaithfulness,</i> apostles, truly
apostolic men, reformers, &amp;c., interfere.</p>

<p><b>II. Antagonism between the Church
and the world must end in the defeat
and subjugation of the world.</b> Jehovah
is the defender of the cause of
Zion through the ages. He has espoused
the cause of holiness against
ungodliness. His people may be dispersed,
but the Church does not die
out. From the lowest ebb it returns
to the flow. The blood of its martyrs
becomes seed. Its opponents turn ever
feebler. This is seen in their more
spasmodic efforts. Its benign influence
has extended far; ever larger numbers
are being brought under its yoke. The
world fights every inch of the ground;
but&mdash;</p>

<p><b>III. The great day is surely coming.</b>
There must come a complete
manifestation of the Church&rsquo;s inherent
glory. 1.&nbsp;This manifestation will
take place by displays of Divine vengeance
on the enemies of Zion. This
method of the ancient time has not
become obsolete. 2.&nbsp;The manifestation
will not be short-lived, but continue,
so that destruction may be succeeded
by a realised state of salvation.
3.&nbsp;Last of all, there shall be seen the
triumph of the Church, when Church
and world shall be conterminous, and
fulness of blessing be enjoyed. (Chapter
xxxv. still awaits its largest fulfilment.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Conclusion.</span>&mdash;1.&nbsp;We have a Gospel
of terror to preach to the world&mdash;a
<i>Gospel of terror,</i> for the Divine vengeance
is informed by the greatest heart of
love. Is the Church, as some say,
becoming less powerful in our time?
Let the question at least provoke
searchings of heart. God still sends
judgments upon unfaithful Churches.
2.&nbsp;Remember, in times of darkness
and trial, that the Lord has the deepest
interest in His Church. It cannot
disappear from the world; but be
alive to removing from it causes of
weakness. 3.&nbsp;Let us encourage one
another in the hope of a time when
the Church&rsquo;s glory shall be fully manifested,
when the time of recompense
for the long controversy of Zion shall
arrive. Let us work in the Church
so as to help to bring about the glad
time coming.&mdash;<i>J. Macrae Simcock.</i></p>

<h3 class="tdc" id="o305"><span class="smcap">A Call to Study.</span></h3>

<p class="bq">xxxiv.&nbsp;16. <i>Seek ye out of the Book of the Lord, and read, &amp;c.</i></p>

<p>On the supposition that a Divine
revelation is given to man, its most
convenient method will be that of a
permanent written record, thus available
for the use of successive generations.
Disparagement of a book
<span class="pagenum" id="p395">[p.&nbsp;395]</span>
revelation proceeds from misconception
of its nature and ends. Out of its
existence flows the universal right to
its perusal, unless it is restricted in
terms. Not only the right, but the
duty. By personal study every one
should know it (John v.&nbsp;39). Our
Lord appealed to the conscience of the
people, combined with their knowledge
of the Word of God.</p>

<p>The duty is here urged in reference
to the prediction of the downfall of
Idumea. It was to become a desolation.
Those into whose hands the
prophecy falls are to search and read
in the Book of the Lord, and compare
the event. Nothing shall fail. Everything
said shall find its mate, its corresponding
fact; for God&rsquo;s Spirit is
the Author of the prediction. Idumea
to-day is its confirmation.</p>

<p>We use the text in order to urge
the study of Scripture as a Christian
duty&mdash;</p>

<p>I. <span class="smcap">Because the Book is Divine.</span></p>

<p>2&nbsp;Tim. iii.&nbsp;16; 2&nbsp;Pet. i.&nbsp;21. It is
the Book of the Lord. The Bible is
a collection of the records of Divine
revelations made at various times, but
bearing on its great design. The inducement
to read a book often depends
on the author. We believe him to be
endowed with literary skill, or an
authority on the subject of the book.
And if God is, in some way, through
the various writers, the Author of the
Book, the authorship is an important
reason for reading it (H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I. 522,
523). Consider who and what He is,
and the solemn relations in which He
stands to us (H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I. 561). Its subjects
will be worthy of Him and important
to us. It will be authoritative.
From the uncertainties of human
thought we find in the Lord&rsquo;s Book a
safe resting-place.</p>

<p>II. <span class="smcap">Because the Book is interesting.</span></p>

<p>In its form, apart from its subject-matter.
Some form it must have. It
might have been in the form of didactic
statement only, without illustrative
facts or poetic beauties. It would
not have been read with interest. Or
it might have been in the catechetical
form. However useful this method in
fastening definite notions in carefully
chosen words, it would have failed to
be a book to which men and women
would return with delight as they
return to the Bible after the period of
youth has passed away. It is made
interesting by the varied forms in
which truth is communicated. It is
poetic, historical, biographical. Its
teaching is usually so connected with
events and persons as to present points
of interest always fresh. The man
finds a solution of the profoundest
problems of time and eternity. The
child finds in its narratives of persons
and events a charm that never fails.
To its interesting form is owing, in a
large degree, its hold on those who
read it from day to day (H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I.
607&ndash;609, 3860).</p>

<p>III. <span class="smcap">Because the Book is instructive.</span></p>

<p>It contains a large amount of information,
not only with regard to the
Jewish nation, but also other nations
of the ancient world. But this is not
its main design. It is subordinate to
the revelation of man as a sinner and
of God as a Saviour. God&rsquo;s character,
man&rsquo;s relation to Him, human duty,
the future state, are all instructively
treated; but they all find their place
in relation to God&rsquo;s great plan for
man&rsquo;s recovery, through the mediation
of Christ, from misery and sin. And
is not this the most important of all
instruction? What would all history
be, all science, all philosophy, if no
voice from Heaven was heard respecting
the most vital of all questions?
Do you desire instruction respecting
salvation? Search and read in the
Book of the Lord.</p>

<p>IV. <span class="smcap">Because the Book is directive.</span></p>

<p>Is not the course of human life like
that of a vessel exposed to the winds that
may drive her leagues out of her proper
course? Does not man need
careful guidance? Conscience is the
captain, but conscience untaught and
unguided will manage the ship uncertainly
and erroneously (H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I. 1299&ndash;1307).
The Book of the Lord is the
<span class="pagenum" id="p396">[p.&nbsp;396]</span>
directory for the conscience. No position
demanding moral action can ever
occur in which adherence to its direction
will not issue safely. How pure
its principles! How righteous its
commands! How wise its directions!
They touch our life at every point.</p>

<p>V. <span class="smcap">Because the Book is consolatory.</span></p>

<p>Sorrows are incident to human life.
There are present troubles. Some
are heart-breaking. We need help
and comfort. The world does not
contain it. Here is the balm that
can heal every wound.</p>

<p>And there is the future. The prospect
of death and eternity. Without
the Book of the Lord men are uncertain
and hopeless. It sheds clear
light on both. How many in the
prospect, are delivered from fear and
filled with hope! What comfort
it affords under the bereaving stroke!</p>

<p>For all these reasons &ldquo;seek ye out
the Book of the Lord.&rdquo; Bring every
question to it. Read it daily, thoughtfully,
for yourself, for others. In your
youth. In your active manhood. In
your old age.&mdash;<i>J. Rawlinson.</i></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 class="tdc" id="o306"><span class="smcap">The Book that Will Endure Testing.</span></h3>

<p class="bq">xxxiv.&nbsp;16. <i>Seek ye out of the Book of the Lord, and read, &amp;c.</i></p>

<p>We may be sure that God would
not give a revelation without affixing
His seal to it; otherwise it would be
useless, there being no evidence of its
Divine origin. Supposing a revelation
given, what would constitute a satisfactory
proof of its Divinity? Evidently
it must be some sign not capable
of being counterfeited, some
unmistakable indication that <span class="smcap">God</span>
has spoken to us. This might be
given by some exertion of Divine
power or some manifestation of Divine
knowledge. As such, miracles and
prophecy would furnish indubitable
proof that a revelation was from God,
and those which attest the Bible are
its proper seals. Along with the internal
evidence and the argument
drawn from the success of the Gospel,
they are so many buttresses supporting
the edifice of revealed truth; but
each is a distinct and sufficient support
by itself. The Scriptures themselves
appeal to the evidence of fulfilled
prophecy in support of their
reception as the Word of God, and
one of the most pointed of these
appeals is that before us. In this
chapter Isaiah predicts the desolations
that were to come on the chief city
of Edom. Placing himself forward in
time amid the scenes he predicts, he
challenges any one to compare the
predictions in the Book of the Lord
with the actual condition of the city;
he is confident that &ldquo;the Book&rdquo; will
bear that test, and will come out of it
triumphantly.</p>

<p><b>I. Read the prophecy before us in
the light of its fulfilment.</b> The apologetic
value of prophecy has often been
discredited. Attempts have been
made to explain it on natural grounds,
as a sagacious forecast, a shrewd prognostication.
But what natural sagacity
could have foreseen that Edom,
so powerful and prosperous in Isaiah&rsquo;s
time, would become a desolate waste?
It has been well remarked that prophecy
possesses as a proof of Divine
revelation some advantages that are
peculiar. Its fulfilment may fall under
our own observation, or may be conveyed
to us by living witnesses. The
evidence from miracles can never be
stronger than it was at first; but that
of prophecy is increasing, and will go
on increasing until the whole scheme
of perdition is fulfilled. It is the
accomplishment, and not the mere
publication of a prophecy, which supplies
a proof of the Divine origin of
the Bible; and this evidence is constantly
accumulating. The prophets
themselves did not understand some
of their oracles (1&nbsp;Pet. i.&nbsp;11, 12). They
were like documents written in colourless
ink, to which some chemical
preparation must be applied to make
<span class="pagenum" id="p397">[p.&nbsp;397]</span>
their characters legible. Their meaning
could be seen only in their fulfilment.
But all the prophetic writings
are not thus obscure; many are clear
and definite; more like the details of
a historical narrative than the visions
of prophecy. Nothing can be plainer
than the description here given of the
state to which Edom would be reduced.
The wards of this lock are too intricate
to be opened by any key which we
choose to apply to it; but the fitting
key has been found. &ldquo;The whole,&rdquo;
says Alexander, &ldquo;is a magnificent prophetic
picture, the fidelity of which,
is notoriously attested by its desolation
for a course of ages.&rdquo; The chief
city in the region of Mount Seir was
Selah or Petra, the Rock City. It
was long unknown till it was discovered
by Robinson, and since then it
has been visited by successive travellers.
It lay embedded among the hills.
So nestled was it in its rocks &ldquo;that
it could only be approached by two
narrow defiles. Dwellings cut out of
the solid stone line the face of the
cliffs, and the central space indicates
that a large city once stood upon it.&rdquo;
Malachi speaks of its utter desolation
(Mal. i.&nbsp;2, 3), but afterwards it recovered
for a time. Its condition for
centuries as described by unbiassed
witnesses is a standing evidence of
the truth of the prophetic Word.</p>

<p><b>II. We may test &ldquo;the Book&rdquo; in
other fields.</b> As a tourist verifies his
guide-book and finds it trustworthy at
every step, so in many regions do we
find the prophetic Word made sure (2&nbsp;Pet.
i.&nbsp;19&ndash;21). Babylon, Tyre, and
the fortunes of the Jewish people, all
bear witness to the truth of the prophecies.
But especially in the career
of our Lord and Saviour do we meet
with remarkable fulfilments of Scripture.
What could be more minute
than some of the prophecies concerning
Him? His miracles, His submission
to unmerited suffering, His riding
upon an ass, His being pierced, His
being sold for thirty pieces of silver
which should be applied for the purchase
of the Potter&rsquo;s Field, the lots
cast on His vesture, and the vinegar
given Him to drink, were all the subject
of definite prediction.</p>

<p><b>III. The Bible will bear testing in
its declarations concerning human
nature.</b> No book so unveils us to
ourselves. We feel its truth in what
it says about our noble origin, our
lamentable fall, our sinfulness, and the
strife within us between the flesh and
the spirit. Because it tells us all that
ever we did, we feel that it must be
Divine.</p>

<p><b>IV. From all this two sound and
important conclusions follow</b>:&mdash;1.&nbsp;<i>We
may put equal confidence in its declarations
concerning God.</i> Nothing but
Divine knowledge and insight can so
disclose the future and the hidden;
and if we have found the Bible reliable
when it tells us of earthly things, may
we not believe it when it tells us of
heavenly things? 2.&nbsp;<i>We may be sure
that its prophecies concerning the future
of Christ&rsquo;s kingdom and the destiny
of the human race will in like manner
be fulfilled to the letter</i> (Ps. lxxii.&nbsp;11,
17; Rom. viii.&nbsp;19&ndash;23). So many of
the prophecies of God&rsquo;s Word have
already been accomplished, that we
should feel confident that those not
yet fulfilled are surely marching on to
their fulfilment. The prospects of
success in the mission field are brighter
in our day than ever they were. The
Church is taking an interest in the
enterprise quite unknown to former
generations, and openings have been
made into lands before closed alike
against commerce and Christianity.
But even if our hopes of success were
less cheering, we would not despair.
With so many Bible predictions behind
us in the past now become history,
we cannot but be encouraged to
look for the fulfilment of those glowing
prophecies concerning the future
coming of the Redeemer&rsquo;s kingdom
which stand on the inspired page.
Let us never lose sight of those grand
predictions; let us cherish a hopeful
and expectant spirit, and in the confidence
of success descend to the spiritual
harvest of the world (H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I.
1166&ndash;1168).&mdash;<i>William Guthrie, M.A.</i></p>

<p>&nbsp;<span class="pagenum" id="p398">[p.&nbsp;398]</span></p>
<h3 class="tdc" id="o307"><span class="smcap">The Certainty of God&rsquo;s Judgments.</span></h3>

<p class="bq">xxxiv.&nbsp;16, 17. <i>Seek ye out of the Book of the Lord, &amp;c.</i></p>

<p>The text occurs midway between a
series of predicted judgments pronounced
on Edom as the representative
of the wicked world, and another series
of blessings foretold concerning the
Church of God, but it is evidently retrospective.</p>

<p>While a minute verification of these
predictions of vengeance might form
a solid, convicting argument for the
validity of trust in the Bible as the
rule of faith and practice, there is
another and more general way of regarding
the text. Search into a certain
book is enjoined because it is the
Book of <span class="smcap">Jehovah.</span></p>

<p>Human faith finds its ultimate basis
in God Himself. The certainty of the
Divine judgments may therefore be
inferred from&mdash;</p>

<p>I. <span class="smcap">The Nature of the Divine
Being.</span></p>

<p>If the Bible be not merely a revelation
<i>from</i> God, but a revelation <i>of</i> God,
too much attention cannot be paid to
those aspects of the Divine nature
afforded by it which man may apprehend
although he cannot comprehend
them. &ldquo;Canst thou by searching
find out God?&rdquo; &amp;c. No; but enough
may be learned of God to make us
sure that it is madness to disobey
Him or trifle with His commands.
1.&nbsp;<i>The long-hidden Name of God.</i>
Proper names were made very expressive
among the Jews. The name
<span class="smcap">Jehovah</span> was sacred above all others;
they treated it with a superstitious
reverence, not daring to pronounce it,
&amp;c. Doubtless they referred with
awe to the time and circumstances of
the communication to Moses (Exod.
vi.&nbsp;1, 2). And so may we in thinking
of the Divine judgments. <span class="smcap">Jehovah,</span>
it is said, &ldquo;remembered His covenant,&rdquo;
and was about to redeem the
Israelites from their bondage in Egypt
&ldquo;with a stretched out arm, and with
great judgments&rdquo; (Exod. vi.&nbsp;1&ndash;8).
<span class="smcap">Jehovah:</span> what does the Name
mean? <i>Being</i>&mdash;unconditioned, absolute,
immutable, eternal Being. If,
then, God changes not, but is <span class="smcap">Jehovah,</span>
to sin against Him is inevitably
to call down judgment; for
<span class="smcap">Jehovah&rsquo;s</span> will must be done on
earth as it is in heaven. 2.&nbsp;<i>Some of
the attributes by the use of which we try
to compass the Divine nature.</i> (1.)&nbsp;<i>God
is just.</i> But sin, in all its forms, is a
crying injustice, and affronts God so
that the Divine majesty must assert
itself in punishment. (2.)&nbsp;<i>God is
good.</i> But sin, as selfishness, is radically
opposed to goodness in God,
who has might, as well as right, on
His side, and, therefore, pursues selfishness
to its last resort. (3.)&nbsp;<i>God is
holy.</i> Separateness from all sin distinguishes
Him in the midst of His
<i>relations</i> to man. How, then, can
sinners go unpunished? (H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I. 2281,
2282, 4478&ndash;4479, 4603&ndash;4610).</p>

<p>II. <span class="smcap">The character of Divine
Law.</span></p>

<p>Law is a transcript of the Divine
nature; the Divine <i>character</i> or handwriting
making Him known to us;
the far-reaching <i>hand</i> of the Eternal.
God reveals Himself in its <i>sanctions,
reward,</i> and <i>punishment.</i> To obey is to
reap reward; to disobey is to be laid
hold of <i>instantly</i> by the outraged
majesty of law. There is no human
way of escape. Visible judgment may
be deferred, but the Divine law is
cognisant of all transgression. In the
matter of the first sin, the formerly
existing <i>potentiality</i> of punishment became
an <i>actuality.</i> The character of
the Divine law may be seen&mdash;1.&nbsp;<i>In
the physical world.</i> The designer of a
ship or bridge diverges from mathematical
truth only to produce disaster.
2.&nbsp;<i>In Providence.</i> 3.&nbsp;<i>In the Word of
God.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Application.</span>&mdash;<i>If the righteous scarcely
be saved, where shall the ungodly and
the sinner appear?</i> 1.&nbsp;The Divine judgments
cannot be evaded. &ldquo;God is
love;&rdquo; but what love! God is &ldquo;a
consuming fire;&rdquo; not sentimentally
<span class="pagenum" id="p399">[p.&nbsp;399]</span>
weak; not given to winking at transgression.
2.&nbsp;God&rsquo;s <i>grace</i> magnifies
His name and law. He condemned
Christ as the <i>Sin-Bearer</i> to <i>death.</i>
Thank God! the sinner may be pardoned,
but the impenitent are surely
handed over to punishment.&mdash;<i>J. Macrae Simcock.</i></p>

<h3 class="tdc" id="o308"><span class="smcap">Transformation.</span></h3>

<p class="bq">xxxv.&nbsp;1, 2, 7. <i>The wilderness and the solitary place, &amp;c.</i></p>

<p>Chapters xxxiv., xxxv., form one
prediction, first announcing the doom
of Edom, and then taking us into a
new sphere where all is light, beauty,
and gladness; a prediction which had
a fulfilment in the return of the Jews
from the captivity of Babylon to
Jerusalem, which they set above their
chiefest joy. But the prophecy is one
of those in which the so-called secondary
meaning is, in truth, the primary;
the spiritual takes precedence to the
natural, and the fulfilment is to be
looked for, not in a remnant of Israel
returning to the land of their fathers,
but in these grand Gospel times, in
which humanity, cursed and bloated
by sin, is blessed, saved, and dignified
by the influences that stream from the
Cross of Calvary.</p>

<p><b>I. The end condition of the localities
on which the Gospel is intended
to operate.</b></p>

<p>How suggestive the descriptive
symbols: a &ldquo;wilderness,&rdquo; a &ldquo;solitary
place,&rdquo; &ldquo;parched ground,&rdquo; a &ldquo;habitation
of dragons.&rdquo; The desolation
turns mainly on the absence of water.
No other similes could so vividly depict
moral barrenness and death. The
unregenerate heart is desolate, weary,
solitary. Moreover, it is &ldquo;a habitation
of dragons,&rdquo; a foul serpent-brood
of uncontrolled passions.</p>

<p>This true of the world as well as of
the individual. Think of the great
unreclaimed wastes of heathendom.
Can civilisation renew them? It has
been tried and found <span class="wsnw">wanting.<a id="o308_fna1" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#o308_fn1">[1]</a></span>
Only the Water of Life, gushing from
the smitten Rock, can give moral life.</p>

<p><b>II. The effects produced by the kingdom of</b>
<span class="wsnw"><b>Jesus.</b><a id="o308_fna2" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#o308_fn2">[2]</a></span></p>

<p>Even we can appreciate the value
of water and the beauty of its effects.
But to Orientals water is a matter of
life and death. Hence as an emblem
it is employed to bring before the
mind the blessed and joy-giving results
of the kingdom of Christ. Note
these results as they are brought before
us in our text. 1.&nbsp;<i>Gladness.</i>
&ldquo;The wilderness and the solitary
place,&rdquo; &amp;c. Music of Nature after
copious rains following on scorching
heat. This an emblem of the joy
brought to human hearts by the Gospel.
The wilderness state one of
sorrow; the river of the water of
life running through the heart makes
it glad. This is seen in cases where
sin and terror are cast out of the
heart by the love of God. How this
result has been manifested in modern
times in nations converted from idolatry
to Christianity (H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I. 1134).
2.&nbsp;<i>Fertility.</i> &ldquo;It shall blossom,&rdquo; &amp;c.
The desert is barren. The Gospel
changes moral wilderness into fruitful
gardens; the individual, the nation.
3.&nbsp;<i>Beauty.</i> Think first of a part of the
earth&rsquo;s surface parched, desert, and
barren, and then of it as a garden
covered with the fairest flowers. The
first and most striking impression
made upon the mind by such a transformation
would not be so much that
of fertility as of surpassing beauty.
So with this moral transformation.
Contrast the state of a country before
with its condition after having received
the Gospel (H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I. 1126,
1127). Look at the annals of missionary
effort: Madagascar, Samoa,
the Fiji Islands, &amp;c. The same change
occurs in individual character.
4.&nbsp;<i>Glory and majesty.</i> &ldquo;The glory of
Lebanon,&rdquo; &amp;c. Symbols of all that
is glorious and majestic. To live by
the power of Jesus the secret of a
noble life. Alliance with heaven
raises men to regal dignity. The
Gospel elevates the character and
dignifies the pursuits of men. Our
<span class="pagenum" id="p400">[p.&nbsp;400]</span>
lower pursuits are ennobled by a
Christian aim, whilst the higher life
has the very glory of God resting on
it. 5.&nbsp;A vision that extends into the
Holy of Holies. &ldquo;They shall see the
glory of Jehovah,&rdquo; &amp;c. Only in Christ
can we see this. He is the glory of
God. The Shekinah is seen above
the blood-besprinkled mercy-seat.&mdash;<i>John
Key in the Modern Scottish Pulpit,</i>
vol. i. pp. 133&ndash;143.</p>

<p class="gap" id="o308A">This chapter is an anticipation of
the great prophecy of the restoration
(xl.&ndash;lxvi.) The firm confidence in God,
the boundless hopefulness, the glowing
visions of the future, the vigour and
joyousness that spread so broad a splendour
over that famous Scripture are
here in a brief compendium. It has
been assigned to the state of Judah
under Hezekiah, to the return from
the exile, to the Christian dispensation,
to a future condition of Palestine,
to some future state of the Church or
of the world, as well as to some other
occasions. Two plain facts are before
us&mdash;1.&nbsp;At no period of Jewish history
was there any approach to a perfect
realisation of the magnificent promises
of this and allied predictions. 2.&nbsp;God
has already given to us so substantial
a foretaste of the blessings here
promised, that we may rest assured
that the one satisfying fulfilment of
the prophecy will be in the triumph
of the kingdom of heaven through the
power of the Gospel of Christ.</p>

<p>Let us look at the picture in the
light of its glowing fulfilment.</p>

<p>I. <span class="smcap">The old scene of the garden.</span></p>

<p>We are not independent of things
around us. Christianity has a transforming
influence over our earthly surroundings.
It is the most beneficent
factor in material civilisation, the
truest patron of art, science, literature,
commerce (H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I., 1124&ndash;1131, 1134).
But behind this lies a deeper truth.
By transforming our hearts the Gospel
changes all things to us. This transforming
influence is shown in various
relations. 1.&nbsp;The <i>wilderness</i> of old bad
things is cleared, and gives place to
new and better things. The axe must
come before the plough. 2.&nbsp;<i>The solitary
place and the desert.</i> It is not all weeds
and bushes. The task of fertilising
the desert with irrigation not less difficult
than that of clearing the wilderness.
(1.)&nbsp;So there are souls that
seem to have lost all soil for spiritual
life. (2.)&nbsp;Then there are deserts of
ruin, the remains of old withered hopes
and joys and loves.</p>

<p>II. <span class="smcap">The new characteristics of
the garden.</span></p>

<p>1. <i>Life.</i> This is the first and most
important thing. Christ, the one
Saviour of society, was the greatest of
iconoclasts. But He was also the
greatest founder, originator, constructor.
He sows seed, gives increase,
brings life. 2.&nbsp;<i>Beauty.</i> The desert
blossoms as the rose. The garden is
not to be solely utilitarian. The
Church is the bride of Christ, and as
such she is to be adorned with every
grace. 3.&nbsp;<i>Gladness.</i> Life and beauty
bring joy. The Church not a prison-house
of melancholy devotion.
4.&nbsp;<i>Varied accessories.</i> The garden will not
only produce its own seedlings, but
plants from all quarters are to be carried
into it. Lebanon gives her cedars;
Sharon her far-famed rose. Christians
are heirs of all things. &ldquo;All things
are yours.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In conclusion, observe two important
points:&mdash;1.&nbsp;<i>This wonderful transformation
will be brought about by the
power of God</i> (ver. 4). We have tried
long enough to reform the world by
merely human agency. The Hebrew
prophets promised Divine help. Christ
fulfils that promise. He comes with life-giving
power. See Him in faith
and obedience. 2.&nbsp;<i>All this is a picture of
the future.</i> Christ has done much for
the weary world. But the old promises
are as yet fulfilled in but a small
part. The Hebrews set the golden
age not in the past, but in the future.
We too must assume their attitude of
faith, and hope, and patience (H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I.
3421). Are we ready to cry, &ldquo;Why
tarry the wheels of His chariot?&rdquo; Let
us remember that God has all eternity
to work with. Meanwhile, let us do
<span class="pagenum" id="p401">[p.&nbsp;401]</span>
what we can to convert our little
corner of the vast wilderness into some
beginning of the garden of the Lord.&mdash;<i>W.&nbsp;F.

i. 231.</p>

The civilisation of Greece and Rome
did not affect anything in the way for changing
spiritual death into spiritual life. The utmost
which it succeeded in effecting was to cover
the frightful corruption of death with a more
beautiful funeral pall&mdash;to hide the naked
hideousness of sin behind a veil spangled
with silver, and gold, and precious stones.
But death was there none the less, and sin
of such a kind that the foulest impurities of
the most degraded heathen could not exceed
the impurities of Athens and of Rome. The
old lesson is being taught us, if we would but
learn it, in our own day. It is not civilisation
that can change the moral desolation of
France, of Spain, of Austria. It is not civilisation,
as understood by men of science and
doctrinaire philosophers, that can change the
moral wilderness existing in our large cities,
and in much of our rural population. It will
only do what it did in Greece; it will merely
cover the ghastliness of death with a more
decent covering.&mdash;<i>Kay.</i></p></div>

<h3 class="tdc" id="o309"><span class="smcap">Encouragement for the Timid.</span></h3>

<p class="bq">xxxv.&nbsp;3, 4. <i>Strengthen ye the weak hands, &amp;c.</i></p>

<p>The Christian ministry addresses
itself to men of various character in
various states. It must be adapted
to all. Sometimes warning and denunciation,
sometimes tenderness, but
always love. The text is addressed
to the officers and leading men of
Jerusalem in a time of general alarm.
The prophet declares that the power
of the enemy shall be broken, and
that instead of desolation there shall
be gladness. The timid and weak
were to be encouraged. God&rsquo;s strength
is made perfect in man&rsquo;s weakness.</p>

<p>I. <span class="smcap">The persons to whom this encouraging
message is addressed.</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;The weak hands,&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;the feeble
knees,&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;them that are of a fearful
heart.&rdquo; Timidity has paralysed them.
After a desolating war the nation might
thus lose heart. A timid woman who
sees insuperable difficulty always in
the way. A man in a storm at sea
lies lamenting that he ventured on the
waters. Some characters shrink from
every touch. They are well-intentioned,
but their faint hearts bar every
effort; and they pass through life purposing
and projecting, but never accomplishing
anything (H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I. 2053, 2054).</p>

<p>This timid and feeble disposition
may be manifested in spiritual as well
as in other things. For instance&mdash;1.&nbsp;<i>In
relation to Christian experience.</i> It
is the privilege of believers in Christ
to know their salvation. But many
fail to attain it. They do not doubt
His sufficiency, but their own interest
in it. They fear their sins are not
forgiven, their spiritual experience not
genuine. Sometimes this is the result
of a tendency to view every subject in
its darker aspects. Sometimes it is
the result of disease. Sometimes of
unwatchfulness, negligence, and sin.
Sometimes of defective conceptions of
the Gospel. Sometimes of a microscopic
self-scrutiny which exposes failings
and defects with severe faithfulness.
The victim of such fears is like
one who wishes to reach the city but
is never sure that he is in the right
way. 2.&nbsp;<i>In relation to Christian enterprise.</i>
Christians are not converted
merely for their own safety. There
is a work to do. Sinful habits, dispositions,
tempers to be overcome.
The dark mass of humanity to be
brightened. The Gospel is to be
carried to the destitute. This work
requires the gifts and opportunities in
the hands of Christians. But the
weak and faint-hearted tremble at
every undertaking. To them the
missionary enterprise is a hopeless
expenditure of money and life. The
time for useful labour in the Church
never arrives. If it is commenced, it
is abandoned when difficulties present
themselves. These weak brethren do
nothing themselves and repress the
plans and efforts of bolder and more
enterprising Christians (H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I. 2057,
2058). Among your fears let there be
<span class="pagenum" id="p402">[p.&nbsp;402]</span>
the fear lest by your fears you should
hinder the cause of Christ!</p>

<p>II. <span class="smcap">Its nature and import.</span></p>

<p>It is intended to strengthen and
confirm the feeble. God&rsquo;s messengers
are to speak words by which faith and
courage be reanimated. They
contain&mdash;</p>

<p>1. <i>An assurance of deliverance.</i> The
deliverance of the Jewish people included
the punishment of their enemies.
God saves in a way suitable to each
case. If your own resources are inadequate,
the Divine resources are
equal to the emergency. He will save
you from your spiritual fears. Has
He not sent His Son? Has not Jesus
died and risen again? Does He not intercede? Does
not His Spirit work? His willingness
to save is equal to His ability. What
wondrous love to man in the work of
redemption! Do you fear that you
will be eventually rejected, or that
you will fail in the service to which
He calls you? (John vi.&nbsp;37; Matt.
xxviii.&nbsp;20). The message is addressed
to your faith. It reminds you of God&rsquo;s
power and grace in Christ. It casts
you on the all-sufficiency of God.</p>

<p>2. <i>A rebuke of fear.</i> &ldquo;Fear not.&rdquo;
Hope is the opposite of fear and the
accompaniment of courage. The fear
of the unaccustomed sailor is dissipated
when the captain announces that
the storm is passing away. The little
child alone in a dark room is afraid,
although she knows not why. But the
mother comes and says there is nothing
to fear; there is no fear where
she is. So let God&rsquo;s presence and promise
drive away all fear respecting our
spiritual condition and our Christian
work (P.&nbsp;D. 1248, 1257, 1258).</p>

<p>3. <i>An incitement to labour.</i> &ldquo;Be
strong.&rdquo; When God&rsquo;s work calls, we
must neither yield to fear nor indolence.
The father leads his child to
the post of duty where his life-work
must be done. He sees something of
the complicated work of the manufactory,
and fears that he will never
be equal to it. His father says, &ldquo;Be
a man; face your work, and strength
for it will come.&rdquo; So God says, &ldquo;Be
strong.&rdquo; Here is work in the Church
and the world. You are weak. Use
the strength He gives. It will grow
by use. &ldquo;Be strong in the grace that
is in Christ Jesus&rdquo; (1&nbsp;Tim. ii.&nbsp;1). &ldquo;Strong in the
Lord, and in the power of His might&rdquo; (Eph. vi.&nbsp;10).</p>

<p>Thus God sends the message of encouragement.
Weak hands are strengthened.
Feeble knees are confirmed.
Fearful hearts are rendered courageous.
And His encouragement is necessary
to comfort in the Christian life,
performance of duty, endurance of suffering
and reproach. And it helps to
recommend the Gospel.&mdash;<i>J. Rawlinson.</i></p>

<p class="gap" id="o309A">Presumption and fear are the Scylla
and Charybdis of the Christian life,
and it requires Divine guidance, together
with all our own watchfulness, to
steer safely between them. On the
one hand, many are inclined to indulge
in vain confidence, and take to themselves
the Christian name and hope
when not entitled to them; and on
the other, many are fearful and disposed
to shrink back from duties and
privileges which really belong to them.
It demands much wisdom on the part
of a pastor so to speak as not to encourage
false hopes, nor discourage weak
and timid piety, especially in reference
to a public profession of religion. My
object is, to suit the case of those who
are well entitled to hope for the Divine
mercy through Christ Jesus, but are
disquieting themselves, or are disquieted
by the enemy, with needless
fears. In meeting their wants I will
state, and reply to, the reasoning by
which I know that many disturb their
own peace.</p>

<p>1. &ldquo;I cannot indulge the hope that
I am a Christian, <i>because I have never
passed through the same religious exercises
and experience that others profess to have
felt and enjoyed.</i>&rdquo; It is not necessary
to dwell at large upon this difficulty.
God has brought many sons to glory,
but no two of them have been led
thither in precisely the same way, or
have been exercised with precisely the
same feelings. If, in the main, our
experiences correspond with the Word
of God in the great points of faith and
love, it need not disquiet us though
<span class="pagenum" id="p403">[p.&nbsp;403]</span>
we never heard of another case exactly
like our own (H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I. 1410&ndash;1429).</p>

<p>2. <i>&ldquo;If I were truly a child of God,
sin would not prevail against me as I find
it does.&rdquo;</i> Answer:&mdash;Sin is never perfectly
subdued in our hearts as long as
we remain upon earth. Some boast of
having attained to sinless perfection,
but they seem to be labouring under a
sort of hallucination, like that of one
in an insane asylum, amid his straw
and rags, who fancies himself a king,
when he is indeed but a poor pitiable
object. &ldquo;The righteous falleth seven
times a day,&rdquo; &amp;c. Read St. Paul&rsquo;s
experience in the last part of the
7th of Romans and be encouraged
thereby (H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I. 329, 1057, 2313, 2861,
4571&ndash;4573).</p>

<p>3. &ldquo;I find that sin not only prevails
against me, <i>but I seem to be worse
than when I first strove against it; my
heart appears to grow more wicked, my
corruptions stronger, and my strength to
resist to be less.</i>&rdquo; Answer:&mdash;To <i>perceive</i>
more of our sin than usual does not
always prove that we are more sinful,
but often the reverse, just as when
one cleanses a room, though the air is
filled with dust floating in the sunbeams,
there is no more of it actually
than before, and there will soon
be less of it as the operation goes on.
We do not know the strength of our
evil passions until we begin to oppose
them. It is also undoubtedly true
that when one is making a special
effort to lead a Christian life, that
then he is especially tempted and
hindered, and that the motions of sin
are then more violent. And further
than this, when any are endeavouring
to break away from the dominion of
Satan, then he assails them with his
most powerful temptations (H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I.
1060&ndash;1062, 1066&ndash;1068, 2524, 2525).</p>

<p>4. Another class of disquieted ones
affirm that they cannot hope they are
true Christians, <i>because they seem to love
everything else more than God.</i> But in
estimating our love to God compared
with our love to earthly things, we
are not to conclude that we love that
most which most excites our affections.
It has been well remarked &ldquo;that a
man may be more moved when he
sees a friend that has long been
absent, and seem to regard him more
for the moment than he does his own
wife and children, and yet none would
think that the friend was loved the
most;&rdquo; so neither must we conclude
because when we are abroad in the
world we find our affections vehemently
stirred towards its various
objects, that therefore they are
supreme in our hearts. We should
judge of our comparative affection by
asking ourselves soberly which of the
two objects we should prefer to part
with (H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I. 3365, 3366, 4188,
4189).</p>

<p>5. <i>&ldquo;A person may in appearance be
like a Christian, and yet be really destitute
of any true piety.&rdquo;</i> Answer:&mdash;Fear
is usually the best remedy against the
thing feared, and none are farther
from the danger of making a false
profession than those who are most
afraid of it (H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I. 339, 2050&ndash;2053).</p>

<p>6. Some again have fears that they
are not true Christians, <i>because they
come so far short of the attainments of
some eminent Christians of their acquaintance.</i>
We reply that the worst part
of the character of those exalted saints
may not be known to us, or they may
not have our hindrances, or they may
have been long in growing up to that
state, while we are only, as it were,
babes in Christ (H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I. 2508&ndash;2526).</p>

<p>7. Another class say <i>that they cannot
think any real Christian ever was so
tempted and distressed with evil thoughts
as they are.</i> We reply, Job was
tempted to curse God, and Christ
Himself to worship Satan. We may
have very wicked thoughts entering
our minds, but if we strive against
them and they are painful to us, they
are no evidence against us. Christ
had thoughts as vile as these suggested
to Him, but He remained sinless (H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I.
4767&ndash;4779).</p>

<p>8. Another class say <i>that they have
doctrinal difficulties, that certain things
in the Bible do not appear clear to them,</i>
and they fear to make any public confession
of Christ till these things are
made plain. We reply that the best
<span class="pagenum" id="p404">[p.&nbsp;404]</span>
way to solve doctrinal difficulties is to
engage in practical duties. Any one
perplexed upon points of doctrine
should read but little on those points,
but engage earnestly in all acts of
obedience which the Bible enjoins,
praying fervently and humbly to be
guided into all truth. One day&rsquo;s
labour in the field of charity, or one
step onward in the path of known
duty, will bring more light into the
soul upon disputed points than weeks
of speculation and controversy (H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I.
590&ndash;596, 1797). It would be endless
to recount all the ways in which
doubts and fears assail us. Their
name is legion, and our prayer should
be that Christ would command them
to come out of the man who is troubled
with them, and to enter no more into
him.&mdash;<i>W.&nbsp;H. Lewis, D.D.: Plain Sermons
for the Christian Year.</i></p>

<h3 class="tdc" id="o310"><span class="smcap">The Healer and Joy-Giver.</span></h3>

<p class="bq">xxxv.&nbsp;5, 6. <i>Then the eyes of the blind shall be opened, &amp;c.</i></p>

<p>This beautiful prophecy is not exhausted
by the first fulfilment of the
promise which immediately precedes.
However great the political deliverance,
it did not include the literal
giving of sight to the blind or
hearing to the deaf. Nor is it only
poetic imagery. It points to something
in the time of the Messiah, to
whose manifestation the scheme of
Old Testament history and prophecy
is subordinate. We find in this text&mdash;</p>

<p>I. <span class="smcap">The blessings Christ imparts.</span></p>

<p>1. We find in the life of Christ a
literal fulfilment of the text, which
compels us to regard it as fulfilled in
Him (Matt. xx.&nbsp;30&ndash;34; Mark vii.&nbsp;32&ndash;35;
John v.&nbsp;5&ndash;9, &amp;c.) Now these
are historical facts. Useless to say
they are miracles, therefore incredible,
because a miracle is impossible.
Who taught you that a miracle
is impossible? You are assuming
what you are bound to prove. The
testimony of the writers of this history
is worth as much as that of any other
historical writers (H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I. 3527&ndash;3529).
Many things have occurred in the
world the like of which we have never
seen. Moreover, the power of God
must be taken into account in deciding
whether a thing is possible or not.
Is it not astounding presumption for
a man to measure Divine power by
his own; to say, because neither himself
nor any other man at present can work
a miracle, therefore God cannot and
never has? After all the argument,
the fact remains. 2.&nbsp;We find that
the coming of Christ is identified
with improvements in the general
character and condition of mankind,
such as may be shadowed forth in
these physical blessings. Where Christianity
comes, the intellectual, moral,
and material standard rises. Savage
peoples become civilised; civilised
nations reach a higher plane. The
influence of personal Christianity commonly
improves the social position of
the individual. 3.&nbsp;But beyond this
we find that the coming of Christ is
identified with the bestowment of spiritual
blessings and the effectuation
of spiritual changes as remarkable as
the miracles it wrought in the physical
region. The spiritual disease of sin,
analogous to the physical diseases it
has caused, is cured by the Gospel.
Take a case. One thoroughly imbued
with hatred to Christ. Not content
with simple indifference to Him, or
rejection of His claims, he throws all
the energy of an unusually energetic
nature into the active measures that
were adopted for the suppression of
His cause. But the saving power of
Christ finds him in a way unexpected
and unusual. He surrenders on the
spot, and finds himself under the command
of Christ to do whatsoever He
wills. He becomes a missionary of
the cross. He is sent to the Gentiles
&ldquo;to open their eyes, to turn them from
darkness to light, and from the power
of Satan unto God.&rdquo; And this case is
a type of multitudes whose spiritual
diseases have been healed, some of
<span class="pagenum" id="p405">[p.&nbsp;405]</span>
them the most virulent and malignant.
It is a work within their souls, which
the power of God alone can effect.
It is a change of the heart&rsquo;s deepest
principles and affections under the
influence of spiritual considerations
only. It is a moral revolution. The
blind eyes are opened to the glory of
Christ&rsquo;s truth. The deaf ear listens
to His voice. The dumb tongue is
eloquent of His salvation, and sings
His praise. And the lame man gladly
walks in the way of His commandments.</p>

<p>II. <span class="smcap">The joy He creates.</span></p>

<p>Gladness runs through the text.
Leaping and singing are expressions
of joy. The blessings of salvation find
the soul in the condition of a traveller
in the sandy desert, weary, footsore,
lame, and silent, who unexpectedly
finds a springing well, and begins to
talk, and sing, and leap for joy. Joy
arises in the heart&mdash;1.&nbsp;<i>From the supply
of a conscious need.</i> Imagine the joy
of those whom Christ healed, when
the blind saw the light and became
interested in the objects around him,
when the deaf heard the sound of the
human voice, when the dumb was
able to make himself understood, when
the lame recovered the use of his
limbs. What joy was brought into
many a home! And when He comes
to the heart with His forgiving, cleansing,
healing love, what gladness He
brings! It is the beginning of days.
It is the enjoyment of life. Christians
have sources of happiness of which
the world knows nothing. &ldquo;Ye rejoice
with joy unspeakable, and full
of glory&rdquo; (H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I. 3041). 2.&nbsp;<i>From
the manifestation of a compassionate
Saviour.</i> His healing miracles illustrate
His character. Beneficence,
tender sympathy with human suffering,
love to man marked His steps.
It brought Him down from heaven.
It nailed Him to the cross. And He
is still the same. He is personally
interested in His people (H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I. 952&ndash;957).
He is the object of Divine
love, and therefore joy. 3.&nbsp;<i>From the
satisfaction of settled faith.</i> Faith connects
the soul with Him. But it is
often assailed. It needs support even
where it exists. The disciples sometimes
wavered, then some new confirmation
was afforded. John the Baptist
in prison doubted, therefore received
the message (Matt. xi.&nbsp;4&ndash;6). Jesus
uses His miracles in evidence. Nor
must we surrender their evidential
power. And there is the confirmatory
evidence of expression. This is always
fresh.</p>

<p>1. This subject calls for grateful
love. Give evidence of your cure by
getting the spirit of Christ&rsquo;s compassionate
love, and by using His instruments
for the cure of others. 2.&nbsp;You
too are still in the power of the disease;
come to Him for healing.&mdash;<i>J. Rawlinson.</i></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 class="tdc" id="o311"><span class="smcap">The Curse Done Away.</span></h3>

<p class="bq">xxxv.&nbsp;5, 6. <i>The eyes of the blind shall be opened, &amp;c.</i></p>

<p>The years of fulfilment linger, and
faith is weak and faint. The picture
of hopeless helplessness is painted in
the context (vers. 3, 4). If we fail,
God&rsquo;s promise cannot (vers. 1, 2). The
transformation of the desert, the planting
of Eden there, and the coming of
God with vengeance and recompense
are one. They signify one vast display
of gracious power. It is no abstract
salvation that we wait and hope
for, but a Saviour. The text describes
the blessings of Messiah&rsquo;s kingdom.</p>

<p><b>I. &ldquo;Is not this poetry?&rdquo;</b> Yes, but
is poetry the opposite of truth? Have
not prophets ever been poets? Is not
poetry the sweetest or strongest or
sublimest expression of man&rsquo;s noblest
conceptions of truth? This poem of
Isaiah is an expression of God&rsquo;s realities.
The poetry, the prophecy has
its answering reality in history. The
age of Christ spake back to it, and
both speak on to us. Nothing shall
be wanting to complete the scene.
The glorious in nature shall but typify
<span class="pagenum" id="p406">[p.&nbsp;406]</span>
the more glorious in man&rsquo;s body, mind,
morals, and spiritual satisfaction and
joy.</p>

<p><b>II. Spiritual and physical evil are
intimately connected.</b> 1.&nbsp;They are
cause and effect. The physical is the
sign of the spiritual. Something <i>radical</i>
was wrong before the wrong things
could come. The doctrine is philosophic
as well as biblical. 2.&nbsp;It is
not meant that any and every special
personal affliction is the result of any
given or particular personal transgression.
A man is not blind because he
or his parents are sinners, but <i>because
of sin.</i> We are living in a violated
order.</p>

<p><b>III. The cessation of physical evil
can only follow the cure of evil that
is spiritual.</b> God&rsquo;s life, God&rsquo;s health,
God&rsquo;s gladness must be poured into
the dumb before his tongue can sing.
The spirit of the blind must be thrilled
with a heavenly vision before his eye
can open on the outer world. God
must come and save before the cripple
can bound as the deer. 1.&nbsp;Man&rsquo;s sin
must be cured, then his sorrow. The
miracles of healing in the Gospels
teach us this. We can never overlook
the moral element in them. It was
when Christ saw <i>faith</i> that He said, &ldquo;Thy
sins be forgiven thee&rdquo; (Matt. ix.&nbsp;2).
2.&nbsp;Health and soundness could not
be given to mankind by a mere miracle-power
apart from spiritual considerations.
No mere almightiness could
effect it. Pentecostal gifts, if repeated,
would probably produce similar signs
and wonders; still miracles can never
be more than periodic and intermittent.
The progressive life of the Spirit of
God must achieve in the race what
they in the individual only foretoken.
Physical healing must keep pace with
moral. The body must protest against
sin. 3.&nbsp;Any philanthropy springing
from other hope lacks truth and wisdom,
and must fail. It proceeds upon
a mistaken conception of human nature.
It only deals with symptoms.
All true philanthropy must begin at
the Cross. The Cross is the sign that
God has come for vengeance and for
recompense.</p>

<h3 class="tdc" id="o312"><span class="smcap">Beautiful Visions Exchanged for Realities.</span></h3>

<p class="bq">xxxv.&nbsp;7. <i>And the parched ground shall become a pool.</i></p>

<p>Read for &ldquo;parched ground&rdquo;
<span class="wnsw"><i>mirage,</i><a id="o312_fna1" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#o312_fn1">[1]</a></span>
and it suggests the inquiry, what
would be the feelings of a wearied
traveller if the mirage he was vainly
pursuing should suddenly become a
pool? It would be new life to him;
if the vision became a reality, it would
be enough. But it is not only the
traveller in southern deserts beneath
the burning sky that sees visions of
beauty floating before his gaze. Countless
thousands thirst for something
better and nobler than they have.
So it has been from the beginning;
and 2500 years ago the prophet declared
that in the days of the Messiah
the soul&rsquo;s desires should be satisfied,
that that which had been only a vision
should become a reality, the mirage
should become a pool.</p>

<p><b>I. Past prediction has become
actual fact:</b> in Christ ideal visions
have become realities.</p>

<p>1. In bygone days some nobler souls
dreamed dreams of a perfect human
character. The &ldquo;Ph&aelig;do&rdquo; of Plato is
an illustration of this. But the dream
remained a dream until Jesus of Nazareth
<span class="pagenum" id="p407">[p.&nbsp;407]</span>
lived among men. In Him all
excellences that were scattered were
localised, focused, centralised; and in
Him we see of what nobleness our
nature is capable. 2.&nbsp;The yearning of
some is for truth, pure truth, stripped
of all human accretions and confusions.
How earnestly search has been made
for it! In this search philosophy and
theology have been traversed and ransacked.
But it is to be found only
in Christ. He Himself declared, not
vainly, &ldquo;I am the truth.&rdquo; In Him are
&ldquo;hid all the treasures of wisdom and
knowledge.&rdquo; 3.&nbsp;In others, conscience
is the most active faculty. Sin is to
them a burden and a torment. They
yearn for peace of conscience. No
suffering seems to them too great if
this can be attained. But they never
find it until they seek it in Christ.
Coming to Him, they are filled with
&ldquo;the peace of God, which passeth all
understanding.&rdquo; The vision has become
a reality; the reality goes beyond
the vision. 4.&nbsp;There are others led
on by visions of a strong virtue and a
noble life. They struggle against their
passions and the allurements of the
world. But alas! how numerous and
lamentable are their defects! They
never learn the secret of victory until
they come to Christ; but when they
have done this, presently they find
that with truth they can say, &ldquo;I can
do all things through Christ who
strengtheneth me.&rdquo; 5.&nbsp;Happiness.
Who has not had visions of it? Who
has not sought it? But, alas! the confession
to which we are all brought is
that of Solomon: &ldquo;Vanity of vanities!
all is vanity!&rdquo; And yet even this thirst
is satisfied in Christ&mdash;profoundly,
exultantly satisfied. In Him we find a
happiness that breaks forth in song,
and triumphs over the pains and sorrows
of this mortal life. The mirage
has become a pool.</p>

<p><b>II. Actual fact is present prediction;</b>
in Christ ideal vision will become realities.
The soul still thirsts&mdash;1.&nbsp;For perfect
purity; 2.&nbsp;For perfect rest from
the carking cares of earth, and infinite
calm in Jesus&rsquo; love; 3.&nbsp;For the perfect
communion of saints. In vision John
saw all this in the new Jerusalem;
and to all who are Christ&rsquo;s indeed they
shall all become realities (1&nbsp;Cor. ii.&nbsp;9).</p>

<p>1. Let those to whom the prediction
of our text has been fulfilled tell the
glad news to others. 2.&nbsp;All for those
who have had these visions all their
lives, but up to this moment have been
utterly disappointed, (1)&nbsp;let them learn
from the experience of others, who tell
them they never knew truth and happiness
until they sought them in Christ;
(2)&nbsp;let them listen to the voice of
rest; (3)&nbsp;let them be sure that until
they do come to Christ, the parched
ground will never become a pool. The
soul needs more than the vision, however
bright and beautiful it may be;
it needs the reality, and the reality
can be found only in Christ.&mdash;<i>Clement
Clemance, D.D.</i></p>

The word <span lang="hbo-Latn">sharab,</span> &ldquo;parched ground,&rdquo;
A.V., more exactly &ldquo;looming sand-waste,&rdquo;
refers to the mirage, of which it is the Arabic
name. The vain shadows of the world, which
deceive and never satisfy, are to be replaced
by the enduring joys of the kingdom of God.&mdash;<i>Birks.</i></p>

<p>Some years ago we were riding over a desert
in intense and almost distressing heat. We
could but lie still and endure it. We turned
our eyes to the south, and, lo! in the horizon
there suddenly appeared a beautiful lake, which
appeared studded with islands of palms! But
it was only appearance, there was no water;
and had we been perishing from thirst, the
beautiful vision would but have mocked our
need.&mdash;<i>Clemance.</i></p>

<p>No one can imagine, without actual experience,
the delight and eager expectation (when
the vision first is seen), or the intense and
bitter disappointment which the appearance
of a mirage occasions to travellers, specially
when their supply of water is spent.</p>

<p class="bqpoemr">
&ldquo;Still the same burning sun! No cloud in heaven!<br />
&nbsp;The hot air quivers, and the sultry mist<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Floats o&rsquo;er the desert, with a show<br />
&nbsp;Of distant waters mocking their distress.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Kitto.</i></p>

<p>The word <span lang="hbo-Latn">sharab,</span> here rendered &ldquo;parched
ground,&rdquo; is the same that in Isaiah xlix.&nbsp;10 is
translated <i>heat:</i> &ldquo;They shall hunger no more,
they shall thirst no more; the <span lang="hbo-Latn">sharab,</span> nor the
sun, shall never smite them more.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The primary sense of <span lang="hbo-Latn">sharab,</span> giving the key
to both applications, is the dazzling, vibrating,
noonday heat. Thence it is here taken as a
name for its effect, of the mirage in the desert
caused by the intense meridian rarefaction and
<span class="pagenum" id="p408">[p.&nbsp;408]</span>
refraction. It is a well-known delusive appearance,
arising from the motions of the
heated atmosphere, taking great varieties of
form, but especially suggesting pictures of
grove and fountain scenery&mdash;lakes, rivers,
green valleys, waving trees, cool and sequestered
shades, with every image most grateful
to the imagination of the wearied traveller.
These often seem so vivid as to be mistaken
for realities.</p>

<p>The very common use of the same word
(<span lang="ar-Latn">sarab</span>) by the Arabian poets, in this mirage
sense, makes certain the real meaning here.
It gives it, too, a glorious significance of which
our translation, though etymologically correct,
and, to a certain extent, quite plausible, falls
far short. It should be rendered: &ldquo;The
mirage shall become a lake (a <i>real</i> lake, not a
mere mockery of one), and the thirsty land
springs of water.&rdquo; For the expressive meaning
of the word rendered &ldquo;thirsty-land,&rdquo; see
Deut. viii.&nbsp;15&mdash;&ldquo;that great and terrible wilderness.&rdquo;
So Gesenius, very happily: <span lang="la">Et
desertum aqu&oelig; speciem referens commutabitur
in lacum&mdash;in veram aquam.</span> (And the desert
having the <i>appearance</i> of water shall be
changed into a lake&mdash;<i>into true water.</i>)</p>

<p>The spiritual idea which the passage, thus
interpreted, suggests is most striking, whilst
at the same time commending itself as having
a solid basis, and far removed from the character
of an arbitrary sentimentalism. It has
a substantial philological support, and comes
so directly from the peculiar word employed,
that we are compelled to regard it as entering
into the prophet&rsquo;s conception.</p>

<p>The primary reference is to the exiles returning
from captivity, passing through the
land of drought, the valley of Baca (Ps. lxxxiv.&nbsp;6),
and refreshing themselves at &ldquo;the wells of
salvation;&rdquo; but there is a glow and a glory in
the language, as in so many other parts of the
Scriptures, that carries it far beyond this,
though the Rationalist, if he chooses, may
rest in the lower sense, and maintain it on undeniable
exegetical grounds. The spiritually-minded
reader finds something more&mdash;something
which alone comes up to the splendour
of the style, and without which the hyperbole,
beautiful as it is, would seem tumid and extravagant.
It is a <i>mounting sense,</i> as we may
call it, rather than a <i>&ldquo;double&rdquo;</i> or enigmatical
representation. The lower is the basis, undoubtedly,
but we cannot rest in it. As elsewhere,
in the Prophets and in the Psalms,
the earthly salvation is described in terms and
figures powerfully suggestive of higher spiritual
realities. The exegesis, therefore, that
comes from this is not arbitrary. To the mind
in spiritual harmony, it seems to be the only
one that truly satisfies the emotional glow and
fervour of the language. The mirage of this
world in the highest reality it can claim&mdash;still
more the mirage our &ldquo;vain imaginations&rdquo;
create in it&mdash;is worse than the dry desert itself;
its delusions, when discovered, produce
more pain; the disappointment intensifies the
thirst. Hence the exceeding impressiveness of
the prophet&rsquo;s figure when rightly understood.
The unreal shall vanish; truth, substance,
eternal reality shall take the place of all that
is false. Man shall cease &ldquo;walking in a vain
show&rdquo; (<span lang="hbo-Latn">betselem</span>), an image, a shadow (Ps.
xxxix.&nbsp;6). This mirage of time shall become
a fountain of <i>real</i> water, of &ldquo;<i>living water,</i>
springing up to everlasting life.&rdquo; &ldquo;With joy
shall ye draw water from the wells of salvation&rdquo;
(Isa. xii.&nbsp;3).</p>

<p>&ldquo;The shadows are gone, truth has come.&rdquo;
Mohammed seems to have, in some way,
caught a spark from the prophetic inspiration,
when he represents the righteous saying this,
as they lift up their hands in the morning of
the resurrection. In the Arabic, as in the
Hebrew, the power comes from the graphic
mode which both languages possess, in so high
a degree, of picturing the future in the present,
and even in the past. &ldquo;Joy and triumph <i>are</i>
overtaking them, sorrow and sighing <i>have fled</i>
away.&rdquo; This is not the land of reality. The
idea comes down from the pilgrim language
of the patriarchs, who so pathetically declared
themselves to be but &ldquo;travellers and sojourners
upon the earth.&rdquo; They were looking for &ldquo;the
better country,&rdquo; the <i>real</i> home, the &ldquo;city which
hath foundations,&rdquo; firm and everlasting. Something
of the same idea, and from the same
early source, perhaps, may be traced in the
most ancient Arabian poets who lived before
the days of Mohammed. From them he most
probably borrowed the striking similar figure
we find in the Koran (Sura xxiv.&nbsp;29), entitled
&ldquo;Light.&rdquo; It has the same word (<span lang="ar-Latn">sharab</span>), and,
in other respects is immediately suggestive of
the passage in Isaiah: &ldquo;As for the unbelieving,
their works are like the <span lang="hbo-Latn">sarab,</span> the mirage
of the plain. The thirsty traveller thinks
there is water there; but lo, he comes and
finds it nothing.&ldquo; The latter parts remind us
of the description in Job vi.&nbsp;17, which may be
cited, too, as one of the examples of its Arabian
imagery. It is a picture of the thirsty traveller
sustained by the hope of finding the refreshing
wady stream; but instead of the imagined
reality, nothing meets the eye but dried-up
bed whose waters have vanished, &ldquo;gone up
to <span lang="hbo-Latn">tohu,</span>&rdquo; the formless void, as the Hebrew so
graphically expresses it</p>

<p class="bq">
&ldquo;What time they shrink deserted of their springs,<br />
&nbsp;As quenched in heat they vanish from their place;<br />
&nbsp;&rsquo;Tis then their wonted ways are turned aside:<br />
&nbsp;Their streams are lost, gone up in emptiness.<br />
&nbsp;The caravans of Tema look for them;<br />
&nbsp;The companies of Sheba hope in vain;<br />
&nbsp;Confounded are they where they once did trust;<br />
&nbsp;They reach the spot and stand in helpless maze.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Another very striking passage, where the
same word is used, may be found in the Koran
(Sura lxxviii.&nbsp;20): &ldquo;When the hills are set in
motion, and become like the <span lang="ar-Latn">sarab</span>&rdquo;&mdash;the
vanishing mirage. It is a description of the
day of judgment, when the world will be found
to have been a <span lang="ar-Latn">sarab,</span> a departing dream. Or
<span class="pagenum" id="p409">[p.&nbsp;409]</span>
it may represent its exceeding transitoriness,
like that other name <span lang="ar-Latn">ajalun,</span> the <i>rolling, hastening,
passing</i> world, which the Koran and
the early Arabian poets give to this present
mundane system as compared with the reality
of Paradise. Hence the word <span lang="ar-Latn">sarab</span> becomes
a common or proverbial expression, <span lang="la">pro re
evanida,</span> for anything light, transient, and unsubstantial.
There is a beautiful allusion to
it in the very ancient poem of Lebid (<i>Moallaka
de Lebid, De Sacy&rsquo;s ed.,</i> p. 294). See also
the account of the phenomenon as given by
Diodorus Siculus, lib. iii. ch. 50. It differs,
however, from the picture usually presented
by the Arabian poets, in that the appearances
are those of animals and wild beasts, rather
than of rivers and fountains. The particular
kind of phantoms, however, would depend
very much on the kind of imagination possessed
by the travellers, and the circumstances
by which it was excited. It is, in any way,
an apt representation of a delusive world,
whether in its images of terror or of attraction.
That the word is thus frequently used in the
Arabic, and that it corresponds well to its
ancient Hebrew etymology, is sufficient to
warrant us in thus interpreting the idea the
prophet so impressively sets forth.&mdash;<i>Taylor
Lewis.</i></p></div>

<p>The chapter of which these words
are a part testifies of Christ. The
prophet, while foretelling it in the
return of the Jews from their captivity
in Babylon, is enabled to look forward
to a more spiritual and much greater
deliverance. With the eye of faith
he sees the kingdom of the Messiah
established in the earth, and beholds
Him open a new and blessed road by
which a multitude of the enslaved and
perishing escape from their miseries
and are led to His kingdom. This
prophecy calls upon us to consider&mdash;1.&nbsp;The
travellers of whom it speaks;
2.&nbsp;The way along which they are
journeying; 3.&nbsp;The home to which it
is leading them.&mdash;<i>Charles Bradley:
Sermons,</i> vol. ii. pp. 127, 128.</p>

<p class="gap" id="o313A">Whatever primary reference this
prophecy might have to the return of
the tribes from captivity, it is evident
that all its interesting and beautiful
descriptions can only be fully realised
in the blessedness and glory of the

spiritually referring to the Gospel way
of salvation.</p>

<p>I. <span class="smcap">The way itself.</span></p>

<p>A religious course is often spoken
of as a way (Prov. xv.&nbsp;21; Jer. xxi.&nbsp;8;
Matt. vii.&nbsp;14). The way of which
our text speaks is described&mdash;1.&nbsp;<i>As a
highway.</i> It is not a secluded private
path, but a public highway opened by
the authority of the King of kings; a
way designed for the general accommodation
of the human race, and leading
to the metropolis of the universe.
2.&nbsp;<i>It is a holy way.</i> 3.&nbsp;<i>It is a plain way.</i>
Not a way requiring extensive philosophical
knowledge or deep metaphysical
research to comprehend it.
All the Gospel requirements and duties
are plain. 4.&nbsp;<i>It is a safe way.</i><a id="o313_fna1" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#o313_fn1">[1]</a>
Satan may try to allure us from it,
but he cannot interrupt us while

<p>&ldquo;The redeemed,&rdquo; &amp;c. 1.&nbsp;<i>Once they
were slaves.</i> Slaves of sin and Satan.
2.&nbsp;<i>They have been redeemed.</i> By the
precious blood of Jesus Christ. Redeemed
to God; redeemed from sin,
the power of Satan, and the wrath to
come. 3.&nbsp;<i>They are now the Lord&rsquo;s freemen.</i>
Now sons, members of the
Divine family; sharers of the Divine
goodness and peace; and they bear
a holy resemblance to their Elder
Brother.</p>

<p>III. <span class="smcap">How they travel along it.</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;They shall return and come to Zion
with songs.&rdquo; 1.&nbsp;They sing the praises
of their great Deliverer (Rev. i.&nbsp;5, 6).
2.&nbsp;They sing on account of the deliverance
itself. 3.&nbsp;They sing on
account of the joys of their present
experience. 4.&nbsp;They sing on account
of their glorious prospects.</p>

<p>IV. <span class="smcap">The blessedness to which

This is important in our own country,
where there are no ferocious animals lying in
wait to destroy; but it was peculiarly important
in Jud&aelig;a and the countries adjoining it.
Many parts of these are said to have been infested
with beasts of prey, which frequently
rushed from their places of concealment upon
the passing traveller, and rendered even the
public roads exceedingly dangerous. Hence
the prophet says of the way to heaven through
Christ, that &ldquo;no lion shall be there, nor any
ravenous beast go up thereon; it shall not be
found there.&rdquo; Not that we are to conclude
that the redeemed have no foes to combat,
and no difficulties to surmount in their course.
Like the Israelites returning from Babylon,
they have to pass through an enemy&rsquo;s country
in their journey to Zion. But He who has
redeemed them accompanies them in their
pilgrimage; and though they are called to
struggle and fight, He gives them the victory,
and renders their path as safe as though there
were no dangers near it, nor any to hurt and
destroy.&mdash;<i>Bradley.</i></p></div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 class="tdc" id="o314"><span class="smcap">The Road to the City.</span></h3>

<p class="bq">xxxv.&nbsp;8&ndash;10. <i>And a highway shall be there, &amp;c.</i></p>

<p>Human life is a journey&mdash;a journey
to the grave. The Christian life is a
journey&mdash;a journey to a better country.
Abraham journeyed to the land of
Canaan; Israel in the wilderness;
their descendants on the return from
Babylon (Ezra viii.&nbsp;31). If you would
reach your destination, it is necessary
to know and traverse the way.</p>

<p><b>I. It is a way easily known.</b> Some
are difficult to find. They are crossed
and intersected so often, and so imperfectly
supplied with guiding-posts,
that mistakes are almost inevitable.
This is a way in which &ldquo;the wayfaring
men, though fools, shall not err.&rdquo;
Serious mistake is almost impossible.
You have a directory so clear that
reference to it settles every question.
God&rsquo;s Word is the guide of life. He
may read who runs. It is true there
are no difficulties in the ascertainment
of the way of life. The road the
child travels to his home is quite plain
and easy, yet he may be ignorant of
the means by which it was made, the
materials of which it is constructed,
the sources whence they were obtained,
the engineering appliances by which
they were bound together, the quarters
from which the cost was defrayed.
At present he has no information, or
it is beyond his comprehension. Thus
in the Bible there are many things
difficult and beyond the present knowledge
of the student. They diminish
with advancing knowledge and
thought. And even if they remain,
they do not affect the matters on
which certainty is necessary. The
way of forgiveness through the
Saviour&rsquo;s death is written with the
clearness of a sunbeam. The rule of
life in its application to all circumstances
is so clearly laid down that
all cases in the court of conscience
find an easy settlement; where there
is a disposition to follow it, no practical
difficulty exists. It is like the
pillar of cloud and fire which infallibly
guided the children of Israel in the
wilderness.</p>

<p><b>II. It is a purified way.</b> &ldquo;The
unclean shall not pass over it.&rdquo; It is
a holy way. The text fastens attention
on those who traverse the road
as giving it its character. They are
holy persons in the company of holy
persons. What is holiness? It is
separation, setting apart, purity, always
with reference to God. 1.&nbsp;Its
meaning is not covered by morality.
That term is ordinarily met by the
performance of the duties that arise
between man and man. 2.&nbsp;Nor is
the meaning of the term &ldquo;holy&rdquo;
covered by humanity. We hear much
of what is called &ldquo;the religion of
humanity,&rdquo; which means a benevolent
desire for the well-being of mankind.
Like morality, it is to be commended
as far as it goes. It is, indeed, a step
in advance of morality. It is a man&rsquo;s
<span class="pagenum" id="p411">[p.&nbsp;411]</span>
worldly interest to practise its virtues.
Humanity rises higher. It looks
beyond self. In proportion as a man
looks out from himself to the well-being
of others, he is ennobled.
Holiness includes them both, but they
do not necessarily include holiness.
They terminate in man, whereas holiness
is in immediate relation to God.
It is the separation of a man&rsquo;s nature
from all sin against God, and is consecration
to Him. God brings a sinner
under the power of His grace, and a
saint emerges. The love of God in
Christ, which pardons him, so influences
his nature that he comes into
sympathy with God, and desires to
be like Him. He makes the Divine
will the rule of his life. He is born
anew. He is holy in heart. His
growing practical obedience to the
Divine authority is his walk in the way
of holiness. Those who have not
experienced such a change cannot
walk in it. They tire. Holiness of
heart precedes holiness of life (H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I.
2813&ndash;2817).</p>

<p><b>III. It is a pleasant way.</b> There
are pilgrim songs. The walk through
the country may be so pleasant that
nothing is thought of its difficulty or
its fatigue. The way of holiness is
rendered pleasant by congenial companions,
by Divine thoughts, by
heavenly communings. There are
difficulties. The way is sometimes
steep; here and there are formidable
obstructions. There are temptations
to weariness and abandonment of the
way. Yet the difficulties are not insurmountable.
They disappear before
the traveller&rsquo;s sanctified determination.
The ability of anything to give pleasure
depends on our feeling in relation
to it. Especially in things of a moral
nature. The regenerated nature of a
Christian makes every step of his
progress a source of pleasure. Christians
are the happiest of men, partly
because happiness is not sought as
their main end (H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I. 1080&ndash;1084,
4161&ndash;4163).</p>

<p>And it is safe as it is pleasant. All
pleasant paths are not safe. Some
pleasant ones are extremely perilous.
The Lord of the way has cleared it of
dangers. &ldquo;He will keep the feet of
His saints.&rdquo; &ldquo;No lion shall be there,
nor any ravenous beast shall go up
thereon.&rdquo;</p>

<p><b>IV. It is a completed way.</b> Some
roads lead to nothing. They abruptly
terminate, and you must retrace your
steps. This is continued to the destination.
&ldquo;They shall come to Zion.&rdquo;
As the Jews reached the earthly
Jerusalem we shall arrive in heaven.
The holy city is a fit termination of the
holy way.</p>

<p>Are you in the way? Keep in it.

<p class="gap" id="o314A">There are a thousand wrong roads,
but only one right one. 1.&nbsp;The road
of the text is <i>the King&rsquo;s highway.</i> It
spans all the chasms of human
wretchedness; it tunnels all the
mountains of earthly difficulty; it is
wide and strong enough to hold all
the millions of the human race. The
King sent His Son to build the road.
He put head, and hand, and heart to
it, and after it was completed cried,
&ldquo;It is finished.&rdquo; 2.&nbsp;It is spoken of as
a <i>clean road.</i> &ldquo;The unclean shall not
pass over it&rdquo; (Prov. xiv.&nbsp;12; Heb. xii.&nbsp;14).
3.&nbsp;<i>A plain road.</i> &ldquo;The wayfaring
men, though fools, shall not
err therein.&rdquo; The pardon is plain.
The peace is plain (1&nbsp;Tim. i.&nbsp;15). If
you are saved, it will be as a little
child (Matt. xviii.&nbsp;3). 4.&nbsp;<i>A safe road.</i>
&ldquo;No lion shall be there,&rdquo; &amp;c. His
soul is safe. His reputation is safe
(Ps. cxxv.&nbsp;2). 5.&nbsp;<i>A pleasant road.</i>
God gives a bond of indemnity against
all evil to every man that treads it
(Rom. viii.&nbsp;28; Matt. vi.&nbsp;26, 28; Prov.
iii.&nbsp;33; 1&nbsp;Cor. x.&nbsp;13). He enables him
to be glad with a great joy (Ps. xxvii.&nbsp;1;

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 class="tdc" id="o315"><span class="smcap">The Happiness of Heaven.</span></h3>

<p class="bq">xxxv.&nbsp;10. <i>And the ransomed of the Lord shall return, &amp;c.</i></p>

<p>&ldquo;Zion,&rdquo; literally speaking, was the
proper name of the city where David
dwelt (2&nbsp;Sam. v.&nbsp;7). But the name
was also given to the ancient Jewish
polity in church and state (Ps. cii.&nbsp;13,
16), to the Gospel Church, with all the
spiritual blessings of the Christian dispensation
(Isa. xxviii.&nbsp;16; 1&nbsp;Pet. ii.&nbsp;6, 7);
and also to the Church in glory, or the
heavenly state of final and complete
happiness with God and Christ for ever
(Heb. xii.&nbsp;22, &amp;c.) We may therefore
regard this text as revealing <i>the general
features of the happiness of heaven.</i></p>

<p><b>I. To whom does the hope of heaven
belong?</b> To &ldquo;the ransomed of the
Lord,&rdquo; whom He has delivered from
bondage and is bringing back from
exile (H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I. 2730, 2829&ndash;2832).</p>

<p><b>II. How do those who attain to
heaven come there?</b> Triumphantly,
&ldquo;with songs and everlasting joy upon
their heads.&rdquo; This is said perhaps
with allusion to the ovations of victorious
chiefs, or to troops coming
home from hard-fought fields and the
privations even of a successful campaign,
crowned with garlands and
waving palms, singing some martial
air, and approaching their homes and
families with shouts of gratitude.</p>

<p><b>III. What do the redeemed realise
when they reach heaven?</b> &ldquo;They
shall obtain joy and gladness, and
sorrow and sighing shall flee away.&rdquo;
In heaven&mdash;1.&nbsp;There will be <i>an entire
cessation of every occasion of grief</i>
(H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I. 1629; P.&nbsp;D. 1753, 1767).
2.&nbsp;<i>There will no longer be any possibility
of falling.</i> What a blessed peace will
spring from this fact! In this world
the sincerest believers, like pilots steering
into port through narrow and
winding channels beset with sunken
rocks and hidden shoals, must work
out daily their own salvation with fear
and trembling (1&nbsp;Cor. ix.&nbsp;27). But in
heaven the spirits of the just are
&ldquo;made perfect,&rdquo; and, like God Himself,
&ldquo;cannot be tempted of evil.&rdquo;
3.&nbsp;<i>We shall meet again with our long-lost
loved ones, never more to part</i> (Rev. vii.&nbsp;15&ndash;17;
P.&nbsp;D. 2996&ndash;2998). 4.&nbsp;<i>The
companionship of saints and angels.</i> The
best and purest friendships here are
often marred by the blots and blemishes
of good men; but there will be
no jarring in the exalted fellowships
of heaven. 5.&nbsp;<i>The possession of Christ
and the beatific vision of God for ever</i> (1&nbsp;Pet.

<p class="bq">xxxv.&nbsp;10. <i>And the ransomed of the Lord shall return, &amp;c.</i></p>

<p><b>I.</b> &ldquo;They shall obtain joy and gladness,&rdquo;
&amp;c.&mdash;<b>this is undoubtedly the
distinctive and ineradicable hope of
human nature.</b> Is that hope a glorious,
and perhaps in its effects a beneficent,
delusion never to be realised?
Or is it the earnest of a reality far
greater than its highest imagination
can conceive? The question receives
contradictory answers from the two
conflicting voices within the soul, as
from time to time one or other gains
a temporary predominance. But the
Christian revelation allows no doubt
on this matter for a moment, and yet
it does not bid us shut our eyes to the
darker phases of actual life. The picture
drawn in this chapter deals with
every sphere of human life. It begins
with the outward: it tells how the
<span class="pagenum" id="p413">[p.&nbsp;413]</span>
&ldquo;desert shall rejoice,&rdquo; &amp;c.; it turns,
then, to the lower nature of man himself&mdash;&ldquo;the
eyes of the blind shall be
opened,&rdquo; &amp;c.; lastly, it speaks to the
spirit of man: the light of God shows
a &ldquo;highway through the desert of life&rdquo;
on which &ldquo;the redeemed can walk&rdquo;
safely; and at the end there is a heavenly
Zion of perfection, to which the
&ldquo;ransomed of the Lord shall come
with songs,&rdquo; &amp;c.</p>

<p><b>II. When did the prophet look to
see his vision fulfilled?</b> He may well
have thought first of the all but present
deliverance from the gigantic
power of Assyria by the redeeming
arm of the Lord. Some such shadow
of fulfilment there may have been, in
the last gleam of unclouded prosperity
which ever fell upon Judah, before its
sun set in the great captivity: such
shadows of fulfilment may have been
felt in the history of man again and
again. Isaiah unquestionably looked
on to the kingdom of the Messiah as
the one ideal of a perfect manifestation
of God and a perfect exaltation of
man. Such fulfilment Christ claimed
for Himself; but it is in the actual
manifestation of the kingdom of Christ
on earth that the prophetic picture is
realised in its fulness.</p>

<p><b>III. If the kingdom of Christ is
what it proclaims itself to be, it must
necessarily be, as on the Mount He
proclaimed it, a kingdom of blessing.</b>
What are the two great sources of the
sorrow which broods over life?
1.&nbsp;Over our bodily life, and the world of
nature which subserves it, there is <i>the
blight of pain and suffering.</i> 2.&nbsp;<i>Spiritual
evil</i>&mdash;the blindness, weakness, sin
of man himself. How does the Gospel
profess to face and scatter both? By
the revelation of the Cross it hallows
doubly the law of suffering and death,
by overruling it to good for ourselves,
and by making it a condition and a
means of helping the redemption of
others. The Gospel deals still more
decisively with the burden of sin: in
this lies the essence of its redemption.
&ldquo;God is in Christ, reconciling the
world to Himself.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. We pray you,
in Christ&rsquo;s stead, be ye reconciled to
God.&rdquo; This is its first message; but
it is not all; &ldquo;Sin,&rdquo; it goes on to say,
&ldquo;shall not have dominion over you.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Ye are sanctified in Christ Jesus.&rdquo;</p>

<p><b>IV. But is that promise actually
realised?</b> We answer boldly, Yes.
It must be remembered that by the
very nature of the case the kingdom
of Christ is seen by us, as yet, only
to the first stages of its conflict against
the powers of evil. What it can offer,
as yet, is a true but only imperfect
earnest of the future. In all the three
phases of this prophecy, Christ asserted
its power to bless the whole
world. He held the reins of the
forces of nature; lifted the burden of
disease and resisted death; brought
in the new life of His grace. He had
joy, like no other joy, amid His continuous
conflict with evil; and to
those who were His, He gave peace in
proportion as they entered into His
spirit. The last conflict was but for
a moment, the chill of dreariness
before the dawn. &ldquo;Then,&rdquo; amidst
some fear, and awe, and perplexity,
&ldquo;were the disciples <i>glad</i> when they
saw the Lord.&rdquo; It is, thank God! a
matter of daily Christian experience,
that, just in proportion as we are
really Christ&rsquo;s, the promise is realised
again and again to us. There is joy
in nature, and a deeper joy and peace
in communion with God. Sometimes
we feel that these things are the only
reality in a fleeting and unsubstantial
world around us. But this reality is
yet imperfect; sorrow and sighing are
rather kept at bay than driven away;
but we have a sure and certain hope
of a perfect future. Without the
realisation of His peace in the present,
without the sure and certain hope of
the future, one hardly sees how man
can care to live; one dares not think
how he can die.&mdash;<i>Canon Barry, D.D.:

<h3 class="tdc" id="o317"><span class="smcap">Modern Rabshakehs, and Their Attempts to Terrify God&rsquo;s People
into a Humble Surrender.</span></h3>

<p class="bq">xxxvi.&nbsp;4. <i>What confidence is this wherein thou trustest?</i></p>

<p>Sennacherib is surprised at the
attitude of resistance taken by Hezekiah,
and sends an embassy to dissuade
him from his mad project.
When they appear outside the walls,
some officers of Hezekiah&rsquo;s court come
out to confer with them, and Rabshakeh
opens upon them with the
taunting question, <i>&ldquo;What confidence,&rdquo; &amp;c.</i>
The proud king of Assyria had another
end beyond that of conquest.
His aim was to show that Jehovah
was on a level with the gods of the
nations. This was, therefore, a religious
war. Every country he subdued
was another god overcome, and
if only Jerusalem were taken, his
triumph would be complete. <i>The
situation here described is an image of
the Christian faith assailed by modern
unbelief.</i> The forces of infidelity have
become bold and insolent. The Bible
is subjected to the hostile criticism of
men who would rejoice to see it overthrown.
Unbelief is marshalling her
forces against the citadel of revealed
truth. She has on her side some prominent
leaders of modern thought,
and employs both press and lecture-room
for accomplishing her destructive
designs. If she can only get the
Christian faith out of the way, the
world will be her own. Our modern
Rabshakehs are hurling against us
the taunting question, <i>&ldquo;What confidence,&rdquo; &amp;c.</i></p>

<p><b>I. What is this confidence of ours
which is so assailed?</b></p>

<p>The question implies that we <i>have</i> a
confidence. Our opponents admit it,
though to them it is inexplicable.
They are forced to bear testimony
to a strange but courageous faith by
which we are supported in life and
death. Jerusalem had nothing to
rest on but God&rsquo;s presence and promise.
Their king had encouraged
them with the noble words of 2&nbsp;Chron.
xxxii.&nbsp;7, 8. Here is the secret
of the confidence which so surprised
the Assyrian king; and on the same
ground do we take our stand against
the opposing hosts of unbelief. God&rsquo;s
presence and faithfulness are the bulwarks
behind which we may safely
entrench ourselves. We have believed
God&rsquo;s Word and have taken shelter
in Christ (Phil. iii.&nbsp;3). On His exalted
throne He is directing the
Church&rsquo;s energies, restraining her
enemies, and giving success to her
enterprises.</p>

<p><b>II. What assaults are made upon
our confidence?</b></p>

<p>They correspond to those by which
Rabshakeh tried to subvert Hezekiah&rsquo;s
confidence. He puts the question in a
contemptuous tone, and then proceeds
to answer it, and to show that the confidence
cherished had no solid basis.
1.&nbsp;He points to <i>the slenderness of Hezekiah&rsquo;s
resources</i> (ver. 5, 6, 8, 9). &ldquo;The
Egyptians can no more be relied on
than the frail reeds that grow on the
banks of their Nile. No help can come
from abroad; and see how weak you
are in yourselves. If you can find
riders, I will supply 2000 horses.&rdquo;
How could such a puny kingdom withstand
the power of Assyria with its
magnificent military equipment? So
unbelief tries to undermine faith, not
knowing that God&rsquo;s strength is perfected
in human weakness. Cardinal
Cajetan tried to browbeat Luther,&mdash;&ldquo;Do
you think that your electors will
take up arms for you? I tell you, no;
and where then will you be?&rdquo; The
brave answer was, &ldquo;Then, as now, in
the hands of God.&rdquo; 2.&nbsp;Rabshakeh
tries to <i>close the door of Divine help</i>
(ver. 7). &ldquo;How can you expect support
from a God whose worship you have
suppressed?&rdquo; But this was a needful
reform, for these rural places of worship
had degenerated into scenes of
idolatry. So the enemies of the faith
in our day try to make capital out of
the changes and reforms that have
taken place. They point to our ecclesiastical
<span class="pagenum" id="p415">[p.&nbsp;415]</span>
divisions and theological controversies
as an argument against us.
&ldquo;How can that be true about which
there is so much diversity of opinion?
How can Divine help be expected to
defend the Christian faith, when there
are so many sects and parties, disestablishment
agitations, and ecclesiastical
rivalries?&rdquo; We answer that
there is a unity among all who love
the Lord Jesus, and however much
we may deplore the need of change
and reform, we are not to be deterred
from effecting them by any fear of
God&rsquo;s displeasure. It can never offend
God to maintain His truth and worship
in all their purity (H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I. 1372&ndash;1374).
3.&nbsp;Another reason for surrender
is urged in ver. 10, where the
Assyrian <i>claims to be commissioned by
God</i> to destroy the land. This was
only a piece of bluster intended to
alarm Jerusalem. It has its counterpart
in our day in those men of science,
who come to us in the name of God
with the truths they have discovered,
and throw them in our face as inconsistent
with faith in the Scriptures.
But there can be no real disagreement
between science and revelation. We
are not going to open our gates to
arrogant scientists who claim that
their department embraces everything;
to materialists who tell us that our
heaven is six feet below the ground.
Let science keep to its legitimate
sphere. It was a good remark made
by Professor Ball to a lady who put to
him some questions about comets, to
each of which he replied, &ldquo;I do not
know.&rdquo; &ldquo;Then,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;may I
ask what is the use of your science?&rdquo;
&ldquo;To let me know, madam,&rdquo; he replied,
&ldquo;that I cannot know some things&rdquo; (H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I.
538, 539). 4.&nbsp;Rabshakeh presses
a surrender in view of <i>the hardships
the people would have to endure.</i> He
threatens them with famine and thirst,
and (vers. 16, 17) promises them ease
and plenty if they will but suppress the
sentiment of patriotism, abandon their
confidence, and give up their city into
his hands. This is an old and well-used
device to make the believer cower
in the face of trials and privations.
But the men of faith are proof against
such selfish considerations. They will
fight the Lord&rsquo;s battles at whatever
cost; for however hard their outward
lot may be, they have inward joys
which more than counterbalance the
loss of all things. 5.&nbsp;The last argument
which Rabshakeh employed is
this (vers. 18&ndash;20): <i>Other gods were unable
to defend their worshippers against the
victorious march, and why should the
Lord be able to defend Jerusalem?</i> This
was his last thrust, and was intended
to bring home to the people the utter
baselessness of their confidence. This
reasoning is not unlike the patronising
tone in which infidels speak of the
Christian religion, as one of the many
superstitions, all well enough for their
day, but now effete, or destined to
perish before the advance of intelligence;
as one of those venerable
systems, all of which are not losing
their hold on the intellect and heart.</p>

<p><b>III. Why should we still hold to
our Christian confidence in spite of
these attempts to overthrow it?</b></p>

<p>The agnosticism and infidelity which
in our time are so loud and pretentious
are only systems of negation; they
have no substitute for that which they
endeavour to destroy. If we allow
them to rob us of our faith, we are
spiritually bankrupt, for these destructive
agencies have nothing to satisfy
the heart and conscience. Never let
us lower our flag for all their threats
and boastful arrogance. Perhaps the
best way to deal with them is that
which was followed by Hezekiah&rsquo;s
officers (ver. 21; Matt. vii.&nbsp;6).</p>

<p><b>IV. What will be the end of all
the assaults made upon the Christian
faith?</b></p>

<p>We know what came of the boastful
insolence of Rabshakeh. Not only
did he fail to unhinge the confidence
of Hezekiah, but he brought upon
himself confusion and defeat. God
answered his blasphemies; God employs
the hostile efforts of unbelief
to confirm us in our confidence. What
our enemies intend for the subversion
of the truth only places it on a more
solid basis. Christianity can never
<span class="pagenum" id="p416">[p.&nbsp;416]</span>
suffer from the most rigid investigation,
for this only reveals its immovable
strength. We throw back on
our opponents their own question,
&ldquo;What confidence have you, what
light in the dark lonesome hour of
death?&rdquo; Or, the strange &ldquo;credulity
of unbelief,&rdquo; which accepts the most
glaring fallacies, whose reason is
clouded by a proud and insolent defiance
of God! We have nothing to
fear, then, from the boastful Rabshakehs
of our day. The assaults to
which our faith is now subjected are
nothing new. Old weapons are
refurbished, old stratagems resorted to;
but it has survived attacks as clever as
those now made upon it (H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I. 1165).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Conclusion.</span>&mdash;Let me put to you
the question in a different tone with
all affection and anxiety for your spiritual
welfare. It is good to have
our position assailed that we may see
its strength (H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I. 1136&ndash;1139). Is
yours a confidence that can resist the
thrusts and subtle reasonings and
plausible solicitations of the world?
The best answer you can give to the
insolence of unbelief is to hold your
peace, and go quietly forward in resolute
faith and persistent well-doing,
giving not the answer of the lip, but
of the life&mdash;a life nourished, strengthened,
and beautified by faith in Christ.&mdash;<i>William Guthrie, M.A.</i></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 class="tdc" id="o318"><span class="smcap">In Whom Art Thou Trusting?</span></h3>

<p class="bq">xxxvi.&nbsp;5. <i>.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Now on whom dost thou trust?</i></p>

<p>The question is important in ordinary
life, but it is overwhelmingly so
in spiritual things.</p>

<p>I. <span class="smcap">A little bundle of answers.</span></p>

<p>1. &ldquo;I do not know that I have
thought about the matter; I have left
the matter of dying, and of eternity,
and of judgment out of my consideration.&rdquo;
How foolish! There are more
gates to death than you dream of.
Have not you walked with dying
men? Suppose you were sure of a
long life, why delay being happy?
Christ says of the rich man in hell,
&ldquo;He lift up his eyes.&rdquo; He might
and should have done so before, but
he said, &ldquo;Tell my brethren.&rdquo; 2.&nbsp;&ldquo;I
thank God I am about as good as
most people.&rdquo; Company in being
ruined will not decrease, but rather
increase the catastrophe. You are
trusting in yourself. But is conscience
quiet? Only the absolutely perfect
man can be saved by his own works.
3.&nbsp;&ldquo;I trust in my priest.&rdquo; Has any
priest grace to spare for you? You
are, or may be, as much a priest as
any man can be; Christians are &ldquo;a
royal priesthood.&rdquo; 4.&nbsp;&ldquo;Well, God is
merciful.&rdquo; You are trusting in the
mercy of God; but, as you state it,
you are trusting in what you will never
find. If you go to God out of Christ,
you will find Him to be a consuming
fire; instead of mercy you shall receive
justice (H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I. 2315&ndash;2317, 2349&ndash;2350).
5.&nbsp;&ldquo;Well, I do not say that
I can trust to my works, but I am a
good-hearted man.&rdquo; There is much
truth in the saying, &ldquo;If it is bad at
the top, it is worse at the bottom;
and if it is not good on the surface, it
will never pay for getting at it&rdquo; (Jer.
xvii.&nbsp;9; H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I. 2669&ndash;2680).</p>

<p>II. <span class="smcap">The Christian&rsquo;s answer.</span></p>

<p>I trust a triune God&mdash;Father, Son,
and Holy Spirit. I trust to the
Father&rsquo;s choosing me; to the Son, as
my Redeemer, Intercessor, my resurrection,
and life; to the Holy Spirit,
to save me from my inbred sins, to
sanctify me wholly.</p>

<p>To some men this does not look like
a real trust. &ldquo;We cannot see God;
how do we know all this about the
Trinity?&rdquo; Cannot you trust in a
thousand things you have never seen
or heard? You have never seen electricity
nor gravity. Those that have
trusted in God find Him to be as real
as if they could see Him. &ldquo;Can we
prove that God interferes to help His
people?&rdquo; Yes, He hears prayer. A
Christian is sometimes asked whether
<span class="pagenum" id="p417">[p.&nbsp;417]</span>
he has a right to trust God. He has
God&rsquo;s promise to help him. &ldquo;Is He
worthy to be trusted?&rdquo; He has proved
Himself faithful and true. The Christian
commends God to others in saying
that he feels he can rest upon Him
for the future.</p>

<p>III. <span class="smcap">Some words of advice to
those who are trusting.</span></p>

<p>1. <i>Drive out all unbelief.</i> With such
a God to trust to, let us trust with all
our might. It is an insult to Him to
doubt Him. The devil calls God a
liar, but it is hard if a man&rsquo;s own
child is to think ill of his father.
We are verily guilty in speaking hard
things of our God. 2.&nbsp;<i>Seek the Holy
Spirit&rsquo;s help.</i> We have often said we
would not doubt again, yet we have.
Let us ask to be strengthened. We
often forget that the Author of our
faith must be the Finisher of it also.
3.&nbsp;Try to <i>bring others to trust</i> where we
have trusted (John i.&nbsp;40&ndash;42, 45).
4.&nbsp;Love Him who thus gives Himself to
be trusted by us. The sister graces
ever live together. Show your love.
5.&nbsp;We must <i>prove our faith by our works.</i>
Let us do more for God. &ldquo;No day
without a deed.&rdquo; Cease working and
you will soon cease believing.&mdash;<i>C.&nbsp;H.

<h3 class="tdc" id="o319"><span class="smcap">Hezekiah&rsquo;s Prudent Silence.</span></h3>

<p class="bq">xxxvi.&nbsp;21. <i>But they held their peace, &amp;c.</i></p>

<p>Dr. Geikie says of Hezekiah, &ldquo;Ready
for war when necessary, and alike
brave and skilful in its conduct, he
was more inclined to the gentle arts
of peace.&rdquo; Among these &ldquo;gentle arts&rdquo;
should be reckoned his cultivated gift
of prudence. Prudence is undervalued
by some, as not taking rank among
the higher virtues, and even sometimes
decried as essentially selfish.
But prudence guards the life of the
highest virtue, and thus becomes of
almost equal importance with it.
Prudence is short for &ldquo;providence;&rdquo;
&ldquo;the provident man,&rdquo; as the phrase is
used, shows prudence in one direction,
and is praised for it. Greater praise
is surely due to the all-round prudent
man. Prudence in man is, in one
aspect, but the counterpart of providence
in God, and those who are given
to esteem it lightly are not pious, like
Hezekiah, but already doubters of, and
disbelievers in, the general and special
providence of God, or likely to become
so (P.&nbsp;D. 2914).</p>

<p>It is prudent to be silent&mdash;1.&nbsp;<i>When
the judgment, based upon the knowledge of
available facts, dictates silence as sound
policy.</i> Silence may, and often does,
imply something quite different from
a wisely calculated policy; it may indicate
abject fear, cowardice, indifference.
All silence is not &ldquo;golden;&rdquo;
sometimes the basest metal goes to its
composition. The order to be silent,
whether addressed by Hezekiah to his
ambassadors, or to the people generally,
or to both, may be conjectured
to have sprung from the king&rsquo;s desperate
case. But even if we leave out
this element, enough remains to justify
the command, &ldquo;Answer him not.&rdquo; It
may be presumed that the messenger
of the &ldquo;great king,&rdquo; &ldquo;dressed in a
little brief authority,&rdquo; conducted himself
as Hezekiah <i>foresaw</i> he would,
outdoing Sennacherib himself in blasphemy
and all impiety. &ldquo;A prudent
man foreseeth the evil, and hideth
himself.&rdquo; Hezekiah did this in the
most literal sense, and his command
to all concerned was to hide the spirit
of their mind behind a veil of silence.
Such prudence, then, is more than
foresight, it is foresight connecting
itself with a certain course of action
as the wisest or best possible in certain
given circumstances (P.&nbsp;D. 3086, 3089).
How rare is such prudence! Not
from evil intent, but through want of
thought, do many persist in running
their heads against adamant. Available
knowledge is neglected, and judgment,
where there is any in such a
case, is adrift and mistaken.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="p418">[p.&nbsp;418]</span>
2. <i>When the deepest feelings are agitated
so as to be beyond immediate control.</i>
Hezekiah&rsquo;s ambassadors obeyed their
orders until Rabshakeh uttered words
the effect of which upon the people
there was good reason to dread (ver.
10); then they broke in, carried on a
great wave of impulse (ver. 11); but
only to make the blasphemer more
arrogantly insolent. Feeling, like fire,
is a good servant but a bad master; it
is blind, and blindly seeks its own objects.
Only in the most highly educated
moral natures can it ever be expected
to flow in proper channels; but in
none should it be intrusted with the
reins of government. &ldquo;I will keep
my mouth with a bridle,&rdquo; said the
Psalmist, &ldquo;while the wicked is before
me&rdquo; (cf. James i.&nbsp;19, 20, 26).</p>

<p>3. <i>When wise counsel is at hand</i>
(xxxvii.&nbsp;1, 2). &ldquo;Hezekiah went into
the house of the Lord;&rdquo; &ldquo;and he
sent Eliakim unto Isaiah the prophet.&rdquo;
There is a kind of piety which
disdains human aid, because each
man may go direct to God. This may
not have wrought so much harm in
the world as the Romish doctrine of
mediators, but it is equally mistaken.
Blessed is the man who knows of a
prophet&mdash;a brother-man of spiritual
insight, moral integrity, and Christian
courtesy&mdash;before whom he can lay his
case! Thrice blessed he who, knowing
such an one, can hold his peace
until he has sought and obtained the
Heaven-provided help! God may
well hold us insincere if we go to Him
and neglect His servants&rsquo; aid.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Conclusion.</span>&mdash;Let us hear and
understand the words of the preacher:
&ldquo;There is a time to keep silence,&rdquo; as
well as &ldquo;a time to speak.&rdquo; We are
lacking in silence and reserve. Silence
is a glorious temple, but in it there
are few worshippers. Be it ours to
wait and worship there!</p>

<p>The worshippers find the very walls
translucent, the rays of heaven descend
in unbroken brightness there.
Silence is the birthplace of the world&rsquo;s
progress, and from the rays of truth
that flash into it are born the grand
visions of the prophets of God, and
kingly purposes too; and from these
are forged the weapons with which
men shall sweep away the hindrances
to all wisdom.&mdash;<i>J. Macrae Simcock.</i></p>

<p class="bq">xxxvii.&nbsp;1. <i>And it came to pass, &amp;c.</i></p>

<p>The message to which our text refers
was sent by a foolish king to a
wise one. Look at them both.</p>

<p>I. <span class="smcap">The foolish king.</span></p>

<p>Sennacherib. Ignorant of God, he
fell into various follies. 1.&nbsp;<i>Pride and
arrogance.</i> Unaware that he was but
an instrument in the hand of God
(chap. x.&nbsp;5&ndash;7), he imagined that his
triumphs were due entirely to his
military genius and the power under
his control. Blind as to the true
nature of his past career, he looked
into the future with boastful confidence;
he had no doubt that he would
go on conquering and to conquer.
His proud survey of the past and this
arrogant outlook into the future are
follies repeated by many men much
smaller than Sennacherib. But every
wise man will remember that he owes
all his past successes to God (Deut. viii.&nbsp;10&ndash;18),
and that all his future is absolutely
in the hand of God (James iv.&nbsp;13&ndash;15).
2.&nbsp;<i>Blasphemous undervaluing
of the power of God</i> (vers. 18&ndash;20). He
therefore imagines that God&rsquo;s people
are in his hand. On this account he
presents to them a curious reason why
they should surrender (chap. xxxvi.&nbsp;16, 17).
He promises them a quiet possession
of their own vines, which they
possessed already but for his disturbance;
and in the same breath he adds,
&ldquo;Until I come and take you away;&rdquo;
and then, to soften that sentence, he
promises to take them to a land like
their own. He promises them no
more, after all, than they had already
on the safe tenure of their own laws.
<span class="pagenum" id="p419">[p.&nbsp;419]</span>
The reason for surrender was either
a mockery of men whom he believed
incapable of resisting him, or an indication
of the mental weakness into
which pride was betraying him. Ere
long there was a terrible demonstration
of his folly (ch. xxxvii.&nbsp;36, P.&nbsp;D. 3413),
an appalling fulfilment of the prediction
concerning him (ch. x.&nbsp;12&ndash;19).</p>

<p>II. <span class="smcap">The wise king.</span></p>

<p>Hezekiah. His disposition does not
appear to more advantage in any passage
of life, nor his conduct exhibit
lessons more generally useful, than in
the circumstances to which our text
alludes. A message is brought from
a proud invader; threats mixed with
blasphemies are sounded in his ears;
a force far superior to his own draws
near to his city. In his extremity he
sought help, not from man, but from
God. In drawing near to God, he
testifies his <i>penitence</i> for his own sins
and the sins of the people by rending
his garments and covering himself
with sackcloth, the usual tokens of
sorrow in the East; his <i>faith</i> and <i>hope</i>
by resorting to the house of God, his
accustomed place of prayer. Observe
the wisdom of the order of his procedure.
1.&nbsp;He began with demonstrations
of repentance. He knew
well that without repentance there
could be no hope towards God.
(1.)&nbsp;This is the true order for individuals
(H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I. 145&ndash;147). (2.)&nbsp;For the
Church of God. 2.&nbsp;Beginning with
repentance, he could cherish hope (vers.
2&ndash;4). Why? He felt that the Lord
would not permit Sennacherib&rsquo;s words
to pass unpunished; and that, if the
sins of the people did not operate to
prevent it, help would surely be sent
him. But he spoke with caution, &ldquo;it
may be,&rdquo; &amp;c. The best reasons may
be found for what we call &ldquo;delays&rdquo;
in providential helps. There was
room for expectation that help would
be given, room for prayer that it
might be given, but no room for overweening
confidence that it must be so.
With his hope there was mingled submission
to the will of God, and that
doubtless helped to win for his prayer
a favourable hearing.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Conclusion.</span>&mdash;This narrative presents
us with the results, on the one
hand, of pride and arrogance; and on
the other, of repentance and an humbled
spirit. In times of extremity let us
not entertain hope without an humble
and repentant suit to God; and when
that ground of penitence is laid for
its support, let us not dismiss our confidence.
God is always able to help
His people. Like Hezekiah, then, to
Him, let us resort in every time of
trouble, whether it be a time of public
danger or of domestic affliction.&mdash;<i>J.&nbsp;H.

<h3 class="tdc" id="o321"><span class="smcap">A King in Trouble.</span></h3>

<p class="bq">xxxvii.&nbsp;14. <i>And Hezekiah received the letter, &amp;c.</i></p>

<p>The armies of Assyria had overthrown
the cities of Ph&oelig;nicia and
Philistia. Samaria had fallen. Many
of the strongholds of Judah had been
destroyed. Hezekiah attempted to
turn aside the tide of war by sending a
tribute to the conqueror. Like all
compromises of unbelief, this act of
submission resulted in increased trial.
Sennacherib did not desire to make
peace with Hezekiah. To have left
Jerusalem unsubdued as he advanced
towards Egypt would have been impolitic
and unsafe. So he determined
to destroy it, and sent a letter full of
boastful arrogance, threats, blasphemy,
false insinuations, and insults to the king.</p>

<p>I. <span class="smcap">Hezekiah&rsquo;s trouble.</span></p>

<p>1. Kings cannot escape trouble.
Storms howl on mountain-tops when
sunshine gilds the plains (H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I. 47;
P.&nbsp;D. 2142, 2143). 2.&nbsp;Neither does
piety prevent trouble. If it were an
absolute evil, the righteous would
escape it; but it is often an angel in
disguise stooping to serve them. The
best need discipline. The pious are
often more benefited by trouble than
by joy (H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I. 116&ndash;142). 3.&nbsp;Trouble
may arise, not from our own wrong-doings,
<span class="pagenum" id="p420">[p.&nbsp;420]</span>
but from the wrong-doing of
others. Sennacherib&rsquo;s lawless ambition
then troubled the whole earth.
God uses evil even to discipline His
saints. He knew what Hezekiah
needed, and used Sennacherib to discipline
him (H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I. 85). 4.&nbsp;Great
troubles may be conveyed to us by
insignificant means. A letter only
was received; but who can tell what
trouble a letter may convey? 5.&nbsp;Hezekiah&rsquo;s
trouble was great. It included&mdash;(1.)&nbsp;<i>The
threatened loss of his
kingdom.</i> He saw before him the loss
of all his greatness and honour.
(2.)&nbsp;<i>Threatened captivity or death.</i> (3.)&nbsp;<i>Possible
demolition of the royal city.</i> Jerusalem
was dear to every Jew. Especially
so to Hezekiah, who had fortified
and beautified it. (4.)&nbsp;<i>The ruin and
exile of his people.</i> (5.)&nbsp;<i>The dishonour
of Jehovah.</i> Sennacherib had insulted
God. If Jerusalem were taken, His
holy and beautiful house would be
profaned, His glory tarnished, and
His worship, which had been lately
restored, obliterated from the earth.</p>

<p>II. <span class="smcap">Hezekiah&rsquo;s refuge.</span></p>

<p>All men have not a Divine refuge
in trouble. The irreligious cannot
rush into the sheltering arms of God.
Hezekiah had done all that a wise
monarch could do to defend his city
(2&nbsp;Chron. xxxii.&nbsp;1&ndash;8), and after this he
committed his way to God. Fanaticism
despises means, but true faith
uses them, and then soars above them
to rest in Omnipotence. 1.&nbsp;<i>Hezekiah
sought God, his refuge, in the Temple.</i>
For the spiritual training of a people
who were to be God&rsquo;s witnesses to the
end of time, God&rsquo;s presence was more
especially revealed there. Special promises
were given to those who prayed
there. Moreover, it was Hezekiah&rsquo;s accustomed
place of prayer. Helpful memories
often crowd around us in places
where we have prayed, and bear us up,
as upon eagles&rsquo; wings, into the Divine
presence. 2.&nbsp;<i>He would set a good example
to the nation.</i> He would lead
his people to seek God in that day of
trouble. 3.&nbsp;<i>He would publicly manifest
his confidence in God&rsquo;s power to protect
and save.</i> His faith found expression
in an act which honoured God and
quickened His people&rsquo;s confidence in
Him. He spread the letter before
the Lord. A most significant act&mdash;a
prayer in action. Probably done in
solemn silence, words afterward rising
to his lips. He would not answer
this letter, but would leave it with
God to answer it. Many letters might
better be left with God than answered.
If enemies threaten us, let us make
God our refuge, and our deliverance
also will be sure (P.&nbsp;D. 779).</p>

<p><i>Learn</i>&mdash;1.&nbsp;So to live as to have
those troubles only which come to us
by Divine appointment. 2.&nbsp;In the
greatest of these troubles never to
despair of Divine help, but to expect
it. 3.&nbsp;To be pious in prosperity, that
when adversity comes we may have
God for our refuge (H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I. 3877&ndash;3879).&mdash;<i>W.
Osborne Lilley: The Homiletic
Quarterly,</i> vol. i. pp. 389&ndash;391.</p>

<p class="gap" id="o321A">The conduct of Hezekiah recited
here teaches us <i>our first duty and best
resource in any emergency.</i> Sennacherib
had captured all the defended cities
of Judah, and at length, determining
to capture Jerusalem, he sent a taunting,
boastful, threatening letter to
Hezekiah, reminding him of the
Assyrian conquests, and warning him
against a vain confidence in the help
of his God. This letter Hezekiah
spread before the Lord in earnest
prayer. The sequel shows how wisely
he acted, and a consolatory message
was sent by Isaiah to Hezekiah.
Sennacherib was not allowed to shoot
an arrow against Jerusalem; his army
was destroyed, and he was compelled
to return ignominiously to his own
land, where he shortly afterwards
perished. Here we have an example
that should be followed by any one
harassed, irritated, alarmed.</p>

<p>1. <i>Sorrowful ones,</i> take note of it.
In this world there is much to trouble,
harass, annoy us, but we should be
more proof against such things if we
were more accustomed to have recourse
to the Divine helps graciously
offered us. You know what a source
of comfort it is to lay open your
<span class="pagenum" id="p421">[p.&nbsp;421]</span>
grief to a sympathising friend. This
source of help and consolation may
fail you, but there is no imaginable
state in which you may not spread
your sorrow before the Lord. Nor
can any friend so fully enter into it,
compassionate it, relieve it. What a
privilege it is to have such a Comforter
always at hand! How completely are
they enemies to their own happiness
who neglect to avail themselves of such
an advantage (H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I. 3739&ndash;3741,
199, 2311, 2322; P.&nbsp;D. 96, 2820).</p>

<p>2. Connected with Hezekiah&rsquo;s
sorrow there was <i>fear.</i> The more
reason for spreading his case before
the Lord, of all friends the most
willing and able to remove the cause
of apprehension. Daniel in the den
of lions, Shadrach and his brethren in
the furnace, Paul and Silas in prison,
might be quoted in proof of God&rsquo;s
readiness to deliver His people from
fear and danger. Whatever may be
the nature or the source of your fear,
spread it before the Lord (H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I.
4058).</p>

<p>3. Another feeling which the perusal
of Sennacherib&rsquo;s letter was likely
to produce in Hezekiah&rsquo;s mind was
<i>irritation.</i> It was written in a tone of
proud sarcasm, well calculated to produce
this effect. If Hezekiah found
any such feeling arise in his mind in
reading it, what could he do better
than lay it before the Lord? We are
continually liable to meet with circumstances
calculated to ruffle the temper.
Then, if we wish to feel and act as
Christians should, let us spread the
case before the Lord; let us not trust
to our command of temper, or to any
resolutions we may have formed, but
meet the sudden call upon our patience
and forbearance by a prompt application
to the Fountain whence those
graces flow. It is possible to pray
under any circumstance. Ejaculatory
prayer is a most precious privilege,
especially in circumstances of sudden
trial or temptation. As anger springs
up so suddenly in the mind in cases
of irritation, it is most happy that
there is an antidote to its evil effects
on the mind that may be resorted to
as speedily (H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I. 3765&ndash;3773).
How much better is prayer than angry
retorts (H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I. 261&ndash;271).</p>

<p>The good effects of the habit of
carrying everything to God are not
limited to those three cases; they extend
to every conceivable circumstance
of trial or temptation. They have yet
to learn the value of religion who do
not know the difference it makes in a
state of trial and affliction to have the
privilege of turning to a reconciled
and loving Father, and spreading our
calamity before Him, and asking His
tender and strong support. As trials
may befall us at any hour, we should
live in constant fellowship with Him
(H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I. 3872-3879).&mdash;<i>John Marriott,

<h3 class="tdc" id="o322"><span class="smcap">A King&rsquo;s Prayer.</span></h3>

<p class="bq">xxxvii.&nbsp;15&ndash;20. <i>And Hezekiah prayed, &amp;c.</i></p>

<p><b>I. Hezekiah prayed to Jehovah as
the God of his nation.</b> &ldquo;O Lord
God of Israel.&rdquo; 1.&nbsp;The nation bore
the name of one of its progenitors,
who &ldquo;as a prince had prevailed with
God.&rdquo; The name Israel had been
more generally applied to the northern
kingdom, which had already been
overthrown, but Hezekiah claims it
for the remnant that was left. When
he uttered that name, did he wish to
remind himself of Jacob&rsquo;s power in
prayer, or of God&rsquo;s special interest in
His nation? Perhaps both. God had
chosen, defended, saved it. Names
which recall Divine deliverance may
encourage us in prayer. 2.&nbsp;His nation
was Jehovah&rsquo;s peculiar dwelling place:
&ldquo;Which dwelleth between the cherubim.&rdquo;
The Shekinah, symbol of the
Divine presence, shone forth from between
those weird figures on either
side of the mercy-seat. Hezekiah&ldquo;s
reference to this peculiar Divine manifestation
was intended to suggest that
God would protect His own dwelling-place.
<span class="pagenum" id="p422">[p.&nbsp;422]</span>
This is true. God&rsquo;s dwelling-place
is always safe, whether it be a
nation&mdash;a man&mdash;a church (H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I.
1246&ndash;1251).</p>

<p><b>II. In his prayer Hezekiah recognises
the sole supremacy of Jehovah.</b>
&ldquo;Thou art the God,&rdquo; &amp;c., &ldquo;and have
cast their gods into the fire,&rdquo; &amp;c.
Polytheism prevailed in the nations
surrounding Jud&aelig;a. Sennacherib had
spoken of Jehovah as if He were the
God merely of the Jews, and in his
ignorance supposed that Hezekiah had
offended Him by removing the &ldquo;high
places.&rdquo; Hezekiah asserted&mdash;1.&nbsp;That
Jehovah was the only true God.
2.&nbsp;That He exercised supreme control
over all the kingdoms of the earth.</p>

<p><b>III. He appealed to Jehovah as the
Maker of heaven and earth.</b> In the
sublime acknowledgement these truths
are involved:&mdash;1.&nbsp;<i>That He is eternal</i>
(H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I. 2253; P.&nbsp;D. 1492, 1518).
2.&nbsp;<i>That He is separate from all His
works.</i> He is immanent in them, but
independent of them (P.&nbsp;D. 1519).
3.&nbsp;<i>That He is omnipotent.</i> He who
made the universe must be almighty
(H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I. 2270; P.&nbsp;D. 1509). 4.&nbsp;<i>That
He has all things under His control</i>
(H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I. 4023). This conception of
God afforded solid ground for Hezekiah&rsquo;s
faith. Before the greatness of
Jehovah the might of His enemies
sank into nothingness. Large conceptions
of God will ever give large
expectations in prayer. The more we
widen our views of God, the more confidence
we shall have in Him in trouble.</p>

<p><b>IV. Hezekiah prayed with great
earnestness.</b> &ldquo;Lord, bow down Thine
ear,&rdquo; &amp;c. &ldquo;Now, therefore, O Lord,
our God, <i>I beseech Thee.</i>&rdquo; Fervent
desires lead invariably to ardent expressions.
Cold prayers are no prayers.
Earnestness is needed, not to lead God
to observe our condition, nor to create
in Him a disposition to help us, but&mdash;1.&nbsp;That
the strength of our desires
may be revealed. 2.&nbsp;That we may be
raised from the low condition of formal
devotion. 3.&nbsp;That we may have all
the spiritual culture which the outcries
of real need may impart. 4.&nbsp;That
we may be prepared to receive deliverances
thankfully (H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I. 3831&ndash;3838,
3893).</p>

<p><b>V. Hezekiah recognised the greatness
of the deliverance which he
sought.</b> &ldquo;Of a truth, Lord,&rdquo; &amp;c.
Other kingdoms had fallen; why not
his? Only that his hope was in God.
No human ingenuity or might could
deliver him. Men must be brought
to see that their need of deliverance
is great. Sometimes they are brought
to see this by temporal emergencies.
Such crises teach us more of God than
years of ordinary living (H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I.
117&ndash;121). Spiritual deliverances must
come from God alone. The soul is a
besieged city. The forces of Diabolus
are around Mansoul. Its Sennacherib
is mighty. The deliverance which it
needs is great. To recognise the greatness
of the deliverance we need will&mdash;1.&nbsp;Deepen
our sense of our own helplessness.
2.&nbsp;Stimulate the exercise of great
faith. 3.&nbsp;Prepare us for the manifestation
of God&rsquo;s great delivering hand.</p>

<p><b>VI. Hezekiah associated the glory
of Jehovah with the deliverance
which he sought.</b> The reproaches
that had been cast upon him had been
cast upon God. The deliverance of
Jerusalem would manifest God&rsquo;s sole
supremacy in the earth&mdash;&ldquo;that all the
kingdoms,&rdquo; &amp;c. No prayers are so
powerful as those which seek God&rsquo;s
glory, for <i>that</i> is the real and ultimate
good of humanity. Many prayers will
not bear this test; they are earthly,
narrow, selfish (P.&nbsp;D. 2842).</p>

<p>Hezekiah&rsquo;s prayer prevailed. The besieging
army was destroyed; whether,
as Kingsley suggests, &ldquo;by a stream of
poisonous vapours as often comes
forth out of the ground during earthquakes
and eruptions of burning mountains,
and kills all men and animals
that breathe it,&rdquo; or by a pestilence, or
by the simoom, we cannot tell. But
it was God&rsquo;s delivering hand put forth
in answer to Hezekiah&rsquo;s faith and
prayer&mdash;1.&nbsp;That His people might
learn to put their trust in Him; and
2.&nbsp;That all the earth might know that
none can defy His power and prosper.&mdash;<i>W.
Osborne Lilley: The Homiletic

<p class="bq">xxxvii.&nbsp;20. <i>Now, therefore, O Lord our God, save us, &amp;c.</i></p>

<p>The conclusion of Hezekiah&rsquo;s prayer.
Sennacherib had accomplished the conquest
of several countries, notwithstanding
the protection of their gods.
He declared that the God who Hezekiah
trusted would also be unable to
deliver him. What could the king do
better than spread the letter before
the Lord, cry for help, and make the
reproach of the Almighty&rsquo;s power the
principal plea? God&rsquo;s honour was at
stake. If Jerusalem was saved it
would be a demonstration of God&rsquo;s
exclusive Divinity to all the nations
around. The result was that the angel
of the Lord destroyed the Assyrian
camp, so that Sennacherib returned to
Nineveh. It is one of the most remarkable
answers to prayer.</p>

<p>This is pre-eminently a Christian
prayer&mdash;that all the kingdoms of the
earth may know that the Lord is God
alone. It is the end toward which all
Christian desire and effort is directed.
We will consider it in this view, and
notice&mdash;</p>

<p>I. <span class="smcap">The consummation which is
desired.</span></p>

<p>It is that all mankind may believe
in the one true God. Most of the
nations of ancient times believed in a
multiplicity of divinities, as the inhabitants
of India do now. But many
of these peoples were devoted to some
one god in particular, who was supposed
to take their country under his
protection. The gods were local. They
did not exclude each other. In time
of war the question, so far as the gods
were concerned, was not which nation
was protected by the true God, but
which god was the strongest.</p>

<p>The spirit of Judaism was entirely
antagonistic to this. The unity of God
was its great doctrine. It was not missionary;
it was a <i>silent</i> protest. So
far as they were faithful to the teaching
they had received, the belief of
the Jewish people was, that while the
Divine Being stood in special covenant
relations to them, He was the exclusive
Divine Being; that until the nations
should become acquainted with Him
they had no God at all.</p>

<p>Christianity occupies a similar position,
only the position is extended.
When it commenced its career, it
made itself felt, not as a silent protest,
but as an active aggressive agency
which aimed at the overthrow of all
idolatry. It assumed the position
that all the religions of the earth are
false, while it is the only religion for
man. From that position it has not
descended. To do so would be to
efface itself, therefore it cannot accept
the modern paganism. It cannot
take its place as one of the many
forms, perhaps the most enlightened,
in which the religious sentiment is
expressed. It cannot accept the
courtesies of &ldquo;thoughtful men&rdquo; on
these terms. It must be all or nothing.
It is the channel through which
the one God has revealed Himself as
the redeeming God. The consummation
desiderated by the Christian
Church is that all the nations of the
earth may be brought to the knowledge
of Him as thus revealed.</p>

<p>II. <span class="smcap">The reason why it is desired.</span></p>

<p>1. <i>Because it is essential to the Divine
honour.</i> God is not regardless of His
glory, He might have remained alone;
but He chose to call into existence
creatures able to contemplate His
glory. Before them He has set His
works. He wishes to live in their
thoughts and affections, not merely as
a distant object of awful contemplation,
but as one enshrined in their
heart&rsquo;s love. He desires to be so real
to them as that they shall connect
Him with all the events of history and
all the experience of life. But this
cannot be, if He is unknown or
regarded as one of many. The honour
of the sovereign cannot be divided;
neither can the honour of God. It is
something by itself. He is jealous of
it. So are His people. They are
<span class="pagenum" id="p424">[p.&nbsp;424]</span>
anxious that He receive His proper
honour from all the world.</p>

<p>2. <i>Because it is necessary to religious
worship.</i> Some religious worship enters
into the life of mankind everywhere.
But it cannot be indifferent whether
it shall be offered to the only Being
capable of receiving it, or to nothing.
The notion entertained of the object
of worship regulates the nature of worship.
Contrast heathen with Christian
worship. An unknown God cannot
be satisfactorily worshipped. The God
of Christianity can be the object of a
worship that is real so far as the worshipper
is concerned, and acceptable to
Him to whom it is presented.</p>

<p>3. <i>Because it affects the experience of
life.</i> A man&rsquo;s thoughts respecting God
must affect his life at every point. He
must not believe in any. He may
believe in many. He may believe in
one. He will be influenced in relation
to the duties, the trials, and the difficulties
of life. Is not the ideal of possible
excellence for humanity higher
under the influence of the Christian
than under any other form of belief or
unbelief respecting God? In the inevitable
sorrows of life, is it not a very
different thing to be ignorant of God
from what it is to know Him as one
who sympathises with the sufferer, and
whose hand will remove the suffering
when it has accomplished its appointed
work? The knowledge of God is the
most practical of all knowledge. It
moulds our life, character, experience,
conduct, at every point.</p>

<p>4. <i>Because it secures the salvation of
the soul</i> (John xvii.&nbsp;3). There must
be an experimental acquaintance with
Him. It is realised in the friendship
with Him that comes through faith in
Christ. It is an abiding spiritual life,
gradually unfolding into eternal life.</p>

<p>III. <span class="smcap">The means by which it will
be realised.</span></p>

<p>The prayer contemplates Divine
action as evidence. &ldquo;Save us from
his hand.&rdquo; According to the reasoning
of the time this would be the
proof. Reasoning from facts still the
most satisfactory. Thus we may reason&mdash;1.&nbsp;From
<i>creation.</i> The wisdom and
power displayed are the wisdom and
power of One. 2.&nbsp;From <i>redemption.</i>
God has interposed for many. He has
actually saved many. Every conversion
strengthens this argument.
3.&nbsp;From <i>the preservation of the living
Church.</i> In spite of persecution, infidelity,
lapse of time.</p>

<p>We may therefore make it a plea for
the bestowment of saving blessings, as
Hezekiah did.</p>

<p>Do you believe in him? Live as
you believe. Think what would be
the effect if all did so. Tell it to the
heathen. Pray for them in praying
for yourself.&mdash;<i>J. Rawlinson.</i></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 class="tdc" id="o324"><span class="smcap">The Christian Church a Continuation of the Jewish.</span></h3>

<p class="bq">xxxvii.&nbsp;31. <i>And the remnant that is escaped, &amp;c.</i></p>

<p>When the power and splendour of
the family of David were failing, the
prophets foretold that the kingdom of
the saints should one time be restored.
Has this promise yet been fulfilled or
no? and if fulfilled, in what sense?</p>

<p>There are other prophecies parallel
to the text, <i>e.g.,</i> Jer. xxxi.&nbsp;31&ndash;33;
Ezek. xxxiv.&nbsp;23; Isa. xli.&nbsp;14, 15,
lxii.&nbsp;1, 2.</p>

<p><i>That these and a number of other
prophecies are fulfilled in the Christian
dispensation is plain from the express
assertions of inspired persons</i> (Acts xv.&nbsp;13&ndash;17).
This explains the language
of Moses, in which the perpetual obligation
of the law is asserted, &ldquo;Ye
shall not add unto the word which I
command you,&rdquo; &amp;c.; and after punishment,
return of prosperity was promised,
on condition of returning to the
law (Deut. iv.&nbsp;30, xi.&nbsp;22&ndash;25).</p>

<p>Consider one or two difficulties&mdash;</p>

<p>1. It may be well said that the prophecies
have not been, and never will
be, fulfilled in the letter, because they
contain expressions and statements
which do not admit, or certainly have
<span class="pagenum" id="p425">[p.&nbsp;425]</span>
a literal meaning. But the use
of figures in a composition is not
enough to make it figurative as a
whole; we constantly use figures of
speech whenever we speak, although
the main course of our conversation
is to be taken literally. Now this
will apply to the language of the prophets.
The words &ldquo;David,&rdquo; &ldquo;Israel,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Jerusalem,&rdquo; and the like, are not so
much figures as proper names which
have a figurative origin, or words
which, having first had a confined
sense, come, as language proceeds, to
have a wide one. All these words
convey a literal truth in their substance.</p>

<p>2. It may be asked whether it is
possible to consider the Christian
Church, which is so different from the
Jewish, a continuation of it. It may
be argued that Christ founded His
Church as a new thing in the earth.
Observe&mdash;(1.)&nbsp;That the chosen people
had in former ages gone through
many vicissitudes, many transformations,
before the <i>revolution</i> which followed
on Christ&rsquo;s coming. They had
been shepherds, slaves; the place of
God&rsquo;s presence had moved about;
they had been governed by a lawgiver,
by judges, by kings, by priests. The
change when Christ came from a local
into a catholic form, was not abrupt,
but gradual; what was first a dispersion
became a diffusion. And let it
be observed, a change in externals
was anticipated as regards the city of
God in the Old Testament. &ldquo;Thou
shalt be called by a new name,&rdquo; says
the prophet (chap. lxii.&nbsp;4). (2.)&nbsp;It
may be objected that the change was
internal, not external only; it became
a Church of Gentiles, instead of a
Church of Jews. But changes of this
kind had occurred before, <i>e.g.,</i> the
change which destroyed the substantive
existence of the ten tribes; in an
earlier age, only two of those who left
Egypt with Moses entered the promised
land. The line of continuity,
surely, was not less definite when the
Church became Christian. The sacred
writers show themselves aware of this
peculiarity in the mode in which God&rsquo;s
purposes are carried on from age to
age. They are frequent in speaking
of a &ldquo;remnant&rdquo; as alone inheriting
the promises (Rom. xi.&nbsp;2&ndash;5; Isa. i.&nbsp;9;
Ezek. xi.&nbsp;13; Jer. xl.&nbsp;15; Hag.
i.&nbsp;14; Joel ii.&nbsp;32; Micah v.&nbsp;8; Zech.
viii.&nbsp;12). There was no substitution
of a new Church for an old; it was
the manifestation of the old law of
&ldquo;the remnant,&rdquo; by which the many
were called and the few chosen. We
may consider, then, the word &ldquo;remnant,&rdquo;
so constantly used in Scripture,
to be the token of identity of the
Creator, before and after the coming
of Christ. Paul expressly inculcates
that the promises made to Israel are
really accomplished, without any
evasion, in the Divine protection
accorded to Christians.</p>

<p>To conclude:&mdash;1.&nbsp;Whether we can
clear up these points or no, they are
not greater than the difficulties which
attend on other confessedly fulfilled
and very chief and notable prophecies,
as that of the dispersion of the Jews.
They were threatened with the evils
which have befallen them, supposing
they did <i>not</i> keep their law; whereas
in the event the punishment has come
upon them apparently <i>for keeping</i> it;
because they would not change the
law for the Gospel, <i>therefore</i> have they
been scattered through the nations.
In this it is implied that in rejecting
the Gospel they in some way or other
rejected their law, or that the Gospel
is the continuation or development of
the law. In a similar way are the
prophecies concerning the elect <i>remnant</i>
fulfilled in the history of the
Christian Church. 2.&nbsp;If the prophecies
in their substance certainly
have had a literal fulfilment, then this
will follow, viz., that the very appearance
of separation and contrast does
but make it more necessary that there
should be some great real agreement
and inward unity between one and the
other, whether we can discover what
it is or not on account of which they
are called one. All Scripture has its
difficulties; but let us not, on account
of what is difficult, neglect what is
<span class="pagenum" id="p426">[p.&nbsp;426]</span>
clear. Perchance, if we had learnt
from it what we <i>can</i> learn by our own
private study, we should be more
patient of learning from others those
further truths which, though in Scripture,
we cannot learn from it ourselves.&mdash;<i>John
Henry Newman: Sermons on
Subjects of the Day,</i> pp. 180&ndash;198.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 class="tdc" id="o325"><span class="smcap">Hezekiah&rsquo;s Prayer.</span></h3>

<p class="bq">Isa. xxxviii.&nbsp;1&ndash;19.</p>

<p>In this narrative there are three
points of difficulty and many points of
instruction.</p>

<p>I. <span class="smcap">Three points of difficulty.</span></p>

<p>1. <i>Why was Hezekiah afraid to die?</i>
Answer: (1.)&nbsp;Even to a <i>Christian</i> man,
death is an event of unutterable solemnity,
for which he feels it necessary to
make the most serious preparation,
and which he would not like to have
occur to him suddenly. (2.)&nbsp;Hezekiah
had not that <i>clear</i> view of the future
which has been granted to us (ver. 18;
2&nbsp;Tim. i.&nbsp;10). (3.)&nbsp;His kingdom was
threatened by a powerful enemy, and
the important reforms which he had
been prosecuting were incomplete; and
even good men are apt to forget that
God can raise up others to do His work
more efficiently than they have done
it. (4.)&nbsp;At that time he had no child,
and that he should die childless appeared
inconsistent with God&rsquo;s promise
to David (1&nbsp;Kings ii.&nbsp;4). Probably it
was a recollection of this promise that
prompted his reference to his integrity
(ver. 3). In those words there is no
boastfulness; they are an appeal to
the Divine faithfulness. On all these
accounts a prolongation of his life
seemed to Hezekiah desirable, and he
sought it from God in prayer.</p>

<p>2. <i>When we compare vers. 1 and 5,
do we not find an astonishing reversal of
a Divine decree altogether inconsistent with
the doctrine of God&rsquo;s unchangeableness?</i>
No. &ldquo;The same decree that says,
&lsquo;Nineveh shall be destroyed,&rsquo; means,
&lsquo;If Nineveh repent, it shall not be
destroyed.&rsquo; He that finds good reason
to say, &lsquo;Hezekiah shall die,&rsquo; yet still
means, &lsquo;If the quickened devotion of
Hezekiah importune Me for life, it
shall be protracted.&rsquo; And the same
God that had decreed this addition of
fifteen years had decreed to stir up
the spirit of Hezekiah to that vehement
and weeping importunity which
should obtain it&rdquo; (<i>Bishop Hall</i>).</p>

<p>3. <i>What was the nature of the sign
given to confirm Hezekiah&rsquo;s faith?</i> For
a discussion of this point, see note.<a id="o325_fna1" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#o325_fn1">[1]</a></p>

<p>II. <span class="smcap">Many points of instruction.</span></p>

<p>1. <i>Sickness and death are the common
lot of mankind.</i> Kings are liable to
them as well as beggars (H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I. 1536,
1537). 2.&nbsp;<i>In the extremity of suffering,
when all human help is vain, the righteous
can turn to God.</i> Pitiable would have
been Hezekiah&rsquo;s case, monarch though
he was, if he could only have &ldquo;turned
his face to the wall.&rdquo; 3.&nbsp;<i>In every extremity,
the most powerful of all remedies
is prayer</i> (H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I. 3720&ndash;3724).
4.&nbsp;<i>How promptly God sometimes answers
prayer</i> (2&nbsp;Kings xx.&nbsp;4). 5.&nbsp;<i>God answers
prayer instrumentally.</i> In this case He
did it by suggesting a simple remedy
(ver. 21), which perhaps the court physicians
had thought it beneath their
dignity to employ. 6.&nbsp;<i>Those who have
been restored from dangerous illness should
make public acknowledgement of God&rsquo;s
goodness.</i> 7.&nbsp;<i>How great are our privileges
in possessing the Gospel,</i> through
which &ldquo;life and immortality are
brought to light,&rdquo; and death stripped
of its terror! In the market-place of
Mayence stands a statue of Gutenberg,
the inventor of printing, on the base
of which there is this honourable inscription:&mdash;&ldquo;The
knowledge which
was once the exclusive possession of
princes and philosophers he has put
within the reach of the common
people.&rdquo; A similar statue might be
erected to the honour of our Saviour,
who has made those views of the future
life which cheered only a few of the
noblest saints (such as David in Ps.
xxiii.&nbsp;6) the common heritage of the
whole Church. No true believer can
<span class="pagenum" id="p427">[p.&nbsp;427]</span>
now be so much afraid of death as
Hezekiah was (1&nbsp;Cor. xv.&nbsp;55&ndash;57).</p>

<div class="footnotes"><h4 class="tdc">FOOTNOTE:</h4>
<div class="footnote" id="o325_fn1"><p><a href="#o325_fna1"><span class="label">[1]</span></a>
<i>&ldquo;And Isaiah the prophet cried unto the
Lord: and he brought the shadow ten
degrees backward, by which it had gone
down in the dial of Ahaz.&rdquo;</i>&mdash;2&nbsp;Kings xx.&nbsp;11.</p>

<p>How was this wonderful result secured?
Did God arrest the earth as it revolved on its
axis, and wheel it round in the opposite direction?
No one who considers what would be
the natural result of such a proceeding, and
what a stupendous series of miracles would
have been needed to have prevented the destruction
of all life upon the earth, will think
so for a moment, especially when a course
much simpler, and equally efficacious, is suggested
by the very words of the different
narratives. Isaiah indeed says, &ldquo;So the <span class="smcap">sun</span>
returned ten degrees&rdquo; (xxxviii.&nbsp;8). But his
record of what seemed to occur must be interpreted
by what God had promised to do:
&ldquo;Behold, I will bring again the shadow of
the degrees, which is gone down in the sundial
of Ahaz, ten degrees backward.&rdquo; And
in the narrative in the Book of Kings it is the
<i>shadow</i> and not the sun that is spoken of
throughout. To reverse the shadow in the
dial it needed nothing more than a <i>miraculous
refraction of the light;</i> and we believe that
this is what occurred, not because it was an
easier thing for God to do, but because it is
in harmony with all that He does to believe
that when two courses were open to Him, one
exceedingly simple and one exceedingly complex,
He would choose the simple course.
God never wastes power. The extraordinary
results produced by the refraction of light are
familiar to all who have given any attention
to natural philosophy. The atmosphere refracts
the sun&rsquo;s rays so as to bring him in
sight, on every clear day, before he rises on
the horizon, and to keep him in view for some
minutes after he is really below it. Contradictory
as it may sound, on almost any summer
evening you may see the sun at least five
minutes after he is set. It is entirely owing
to refraction that we have any morning or
evening twilight. That the rays of the sun
can be so refracted as to cause him to be seen
where he actually is not is thus a matter of
daily experience. And there are some extraordinary
cases on record. Kepler, the great
astronomer, mentions that some &ldquo;Hollanders,
who wintered in Nova Zembla in the year
1596, were surprised to find that, after a continual
night of three months, the sun began
to rise almost <i>seventeen days</i> sooner than he
should have done.&rdquo; This can only be accounted
for by a miracle, or by an extraordinary refraction
of the sun&rsquo;s rays passing through the
cold dense air in that climate. In 1703 again,
the prior of the monastery at Metz, in Lothringen,
and many others, observed that the
shadow of a sundial went back an hour and
a half. It is thus abundantly plain that the
result related could have been secured by a
refraction of the light, a common occurrence
in Nature. The miracle consisted <i>in its happening
at that particular moment;</i> just as in
the case of the fish that Peter caught which
contained money. Many fish containing
money have been caught; but there was the
miracle&mdash;that this fish was caught at the very
time which Christ had indicated. In like
manner the miraculous element in the regression
of the shadow on the sun-dial of Ahaz
was its occurring just at the very time at
which it was needed to verify the prophet&rsquo;s
word and strengthen the monarch&rsquo;s faith.</p></div>
</div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 class="tdc" id="o326"><span class="smcap">Preparation for Death.</span></h3>

<p class="bq">xxxviii.&nbsp;1. <i>Set thine house in order; for thou shalt die, and not live.</i></p>

<p>This announcement was made to
Hezekiah when suffering under dangerous
illness. In answer to his prayer
the sentence was mitigated. Fifteen
years were added to his life. It is
not wrong to pray for the prolongation
of life when important interests are
concerned, and when we pray with
due submission to Him whose prerogative
it is to fix its duration.</p>

<p>The text furnishes a theme for useful
meditation. It contains&mdash;</p>

<p>I. <span class="smcap">A solemn announcement.</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Thou shalt die.&rdquo; It may be
viewed either as the declaration of a
familiar truth or as the prediction of
an immediate event. 1.&nbsp;<i>As the declaration
of a familiar truth.</i> Nothing is
more familiar. The universal reign
of death over all the generations that
have preceded us necessitates the conclusion
that, unless we are alive when
the Lord comes, we shall follow them.
We are reminded of the truth by
obituary notices in newspapers, by the
spectacle of funerals passing quietly
along the streets, by the silent departure
of friends. &ldquo;The sentence of
death has passed upon all men.&rdquo; However
long life may be protracted in
individual instance, it never suggests
the question whether they will be exceptions
to the general rule. It only
suggests the wonder that in any instance
<span class="pagenum" id="p428">[p.&nbsp;428]</span>
life is so far protracted. The
only uncertain thing is how much
longer or shorter than the average
our own life will be. Death may
come to us when in fullest health by
the unexpected accident, or by the
illness which has been caught we
know not how, or by the subtle
disease which silently undermines the
system, eating away the cord that has
bound us to life (H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I. 1536&ndash;1546;
P.&nbsp;D. 751, 752).</p>

<p>Nor is this event a mere departure
from the present life. To our friends
it is chiefly that. It is their deprivation
of all that makes us interesting
and valuable to them. To ourselves
it is very much more. It is the precursor
of our appearance before the
judgment-seat of the Lord Jesus
Christ (2&nbsp;Cor. v.&nbsp;10; Rom. xiv.&nbsp;12;
Matt. xxv.&nbsp;34, 41; Rev. xx.&nbsp;12). It
is to us a much more serious matter
than passing into nothingness.</p>

<p>Is it, therefore, a subject to be
studiously avoided? Is it not one
that should be often before us? Look
it in the face; dwell on it. Such
thought will not produce indifference
to the present. It will invest it with
a deeper seriousness. Its interests
and duties will be contemplated in
their connection with the great future.
The smallest thing has such a connection.
The attitude we assume towards
God, Christ, the Divine commands,
His kingdom. Our conduct in business,
the family, among men. The
influence of our words, acts, spirit,
character. All these come into this
great account. Death closes the account.
Does not this attach dignity,
solemnity, earnestness to the whole
of life? (H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I. 1557&ndash;1566).</p>

<p>2. <i>As the prediction of an immediate
event.</i> Supposing, instead of familiar
truth, it were announced to us
on good authority that immediately,
or within a given time, we should die,
what would be the effect? There are
aged Christians, whose life-work is
done, to whom it would be welcome
news. There are young Christians
who have recently found peace in
Christ but have not yet realised the
privilege of working for Him, to whom
it would be welcome. There are others
to whom it would be terrible, because
they have not yet found Christ nor surrendered
to God. It would be to
them like the knell of doom (P.&nbsp;D.
684). And yet it may be the duty of
some one to make that
<span class="wsnw">announcement.<a id="o326_fna1" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#o326_fn1">[1]</a></span></p>

<p>II. <span class="smcap">A suitable direction.</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Set thine house in order.&rdquo; This
direction is twofold. 1.&nbsp;<i>With regard
to your worldly affairs.</i> The king was
directed to give command concerning
his house. His wishes respecting the
succession to the throne. Every business-man
should keep his affairs in
such order that if he were suddenly
called away there would be no difficulty.
Every one possessed of property
should, in view of the uncertainty
of life, make his will. Many leave
this duty to the last. If it has been
so left and sickness comes, it should
be one of the first things done. It
will not hasten death. It will save
expense. It will secure the rights of
all. It will prevent disputes. It will
relieve the mind. It will leave it free
to attend to the soul. 2.&nbsp;<i>With regard
to your eternal interests.</i> Think of the
soul&rsquo;s future. Are you prepared for
the great journey? Are you ready
with your accounts? Recall your obligations
to the Almighty. Consider
how they have been discharged. Overcome
your reluctance to a thorough
conviction of sin. Let there be
humility, contrition, repentance. Seek
mercy. There is a Saviour. Believe
in Him. Yield your heart. If already
a Christian, survey the position. If
near death, all this is obviously necessary.
If not near death, or death not
apparently near, it is necessary on the
ground of your liability to death. It
will come some time. The only safety
is to close with Jesus now.&mdash;<i>J. Rawlinson.</i></p>

<div class="footnotes"><h4 class="tdc">FOOTNOTES:</h4>
<div class="footnote" id="o326_fn1"><p><a href="#o326_fna1"><span class="label">[1]</span></a>
It is a distressing duty. It requires
the skilful and delicate hand. But it must
be performed. There is the tender and delicate
girl who took a cold some time ago. She
was better and worse. It was nothing. Somehow
she became weaker. At length she had
only strength to lie in bed. She is sure that
<span class="pagenum" id="p429">[p.&nbsp;429]</span>
with more genial weather she will recover.
All has been done. One day the physician,
with grace and sympathetic manner, tells her
mother the case is hopeless. Break it to her.
How can she? There is a fear that the revelation
may accelerate the catastrophe. It may
not. The sick are not usually so much alarmed
at the thought of death as is supposed. At
any rate, it seems only fair to them that they
should know the seriousness of their position.
If they are already saved, it will probably lead
them to plant their feet more firmly on the
Rock of Ages. If they are not yet saved, it
may not be too late.&mdash;<i>Rawlinson.</i></p></div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 class="tdc" id="o327"><span class="smcap">Duties of the Sick and Dying.</span></h3>

<p class="bq">xxxviii.&nbsp;1. <i>Set thine house in order, for thou shalt die.</i></p>

<p>This message sent from God to
Hezekiah in his sickness contains a
warning applicable to us all. It becomes
us all to maintain such order in
our worldly and spiritual affairs as
that death, whenever he knocks at
our door, may find us prepared to
obey his summons (H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I. 1562&ndash;1566).
But this is especially the duty
of those who are visited, even now,
by the forerunners and harbingers of
death (H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I. 1561).</p>

<p>Most men, when laid aside by sickness,
are disposed to turn in their pain
and apparent peril to God who hath
smitten, and who alone can heal; and
to prepare for the great change in
which the sickness may terminate.
But few when thus called upon know
how to set about the work, which
they are then ready to allow to be
most necessary and urgent. Even
those who have lived outwardly blameless
lives, are apt to be so distressed
and confused by fear of death, that
they do not know how to do what
will turn the king of terrors into a
messenger of peace, rest, and immortality
(H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I. 1567, 1568, 1570; P.&nbsp;D.
684, 741, 761). Therefore,
let those who are now in health receive
some hints for their behaviour under
sickness.</p>

<p>I. <span class="smcap">Duties to be performed by
the sick and dying.</span></p>

<p>1. The first act of the mind on receiving
any warning of our mortal and
most frail condition should be an act
of recollection, a solemn meditation
on the power, wisdom, and goodness of
the Most High, in whose hands alone
we are, who can kill and make
<span class="wsnw">alive.<a id="o327_fna1" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#o327_fn1">[1]</a></span>
Let us think especially of the love which
He has shown us in the gift of His
Son and the help of His Holy Spirit.</p>

<p>2. When our minds are thus sobered
and composed, we must consider what
means are yet within our reach to interest
God&rsquo;s power and mercy in our
favour. This may be best accomplished
by repentance. To this an
examination of our past life is absolutely
necessary.</p>

<p>In this examination let us attend to
the following cautions:&mdash;(1.)&nbsp;Let it be
honest, however much this may humble
us. (2.)&nbsp;Let us not attempt to
plead our own good deeds in extenuation
of our sins. (3.)&nbsp;Let us not be
too particular or dwell too long in
our recapitulation of such sins as are
gone by and are irremediable; for
these regrets, however natural, are
useless, and beyond a certain degree
injurious. With such recollections a
guilty pleasure may be received in our
souls; our fancy may return with
more regret than horror to the scenes
of our former enjoyment. (4.)&nbsp;Let us
be more anxious to recollect those sins,
if there be any, for which it is in our
power to make reparation. In this
let us be most searching and honest.
Thorough restitution is essential to
prove that our repentance is genuine,
and so also is sincere forgiveness of
our enemies.</p>

<p>3. Thus truly penitent, let us by
faith grasp firmly God&rsquo;s promises of
forgiveness through our Lord Jesus
Christ (1&nbsp;John i.&nbsp;9).</p>

<p>4. If we have been so unwise as to
have left our worldly affairs unsettled,
let us not be influenced by any foolish
fear of alarming our family, or of appearing
alarmed ourselves, from immediately
making such a disposition
of our property as we shall not fear
to give account of in the hour of judgment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="p430">[p.&nbsp;430]</span>
5. Let us make up our mind to renounce
the world entirely, and all
restless hope of recovery; resigning
all our prospects entirely into the
hand of God, who is best acquainted
with our wants and with the wants of
those whom we are about to leave
behind; and who is infinitely able
to protect and provide for us and
them (H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I. 157, 158, 4055).</p>

<p>6. That our meditations may become
holy and comfortable, our repentance
sincere and effectual, our restitution
humble and public, our charity pure
and edifying, our justice without taint,
our resignation without reserve, let
us give ourselves diligently to prayer
(H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I. 177, 178, 3739&ndash;3746).</p>

<p>7. In order that we may be assisted
in these spiritual duties, let us send
promptly for the minister of the
Church to which we belong.</p>

<p>II. <span class="smcap">Sins against which we must
be on our guard.</span></p>

<p>The sins to which the sick and
dying are most exposed are evil and
trifling thoughts, unthankfulness, impatience,
peevishness, and hypocrisy.
To the first two of these men are
liable on any remission of pain, or
appearance of approaching amendment.
There is no other cure for
these than an immediate return to
prayer and meditation. These remedies
will also keep us from murmuring
and ill-temper. Hypocrisy
may seem a strange vice to impute to
a sick or dying person, but it is not
uncommon. It is shown in seeking
compassion and kindness by counterfeiting
the appearance of greater suffering
than really belongs to our
cases, or in the affectation of more
faith, or resignation, or humility, or
peace of conscience than either our
own hearts or God will sanction. The
desire of worldly praise will sometimes
linger so late, and cling so closely
about the affections of man, that some
persons continue to act a part until
their voice and senses fail them.</p>

<p>Let the difficulty of the duties
which a sick man has to perform,
and the number and greatness of the
temptations to which he is liable, be
an argument with us to leave as little
as possible to be done in that state of
weakness and alarm (H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I. 4251&ndash;4258).&mdash;<i>Reginald
Heber: Sermons,</i> vol.
i. pp. 92&ndash;111.</p>

<div class="footnotes"><h4 class="tdc">FOOTNOTES:</h4>
<div class="footnote" id="o327_fn1"><p><a href="#o327_fna1"><span class="label">[1]</span></a>
This will lead us to submit with more
temper and mildness to whatever means are
prescribed for our recovery, and also to wait
their event with less querulous eagerness than
if we corroded our thoughts by the pangs we
endure or by the earthly succours whereby
we hope to escape or lessen them. There
is something soothing as well as sublime
in the contemplation of greatness and
power. We feel it when we gaze on the great
works of Nature. He whose heart expiates
in the prospect of the ocean or of the starry
heaven is for a time insensible to his own resentments
or misfortune, and is identified,
as it were, with the glorious and tranquil
scene before him. One of the principal joys
of heaven, we are told, is the delight of gazing
upon God; and even in this state of mortal
darkness and misery, if we can for a time so
forsake the thoughts of earthly things as to
call up to our mind whatever images of greatness,
and power, and perfection the Scriptures
have revealed to us concerning Him, our
heart will be filled as by necessity with love
and admiration for an object so glorious, and
our resignation to His decree will become a
matter, not only of necessity, but in some respects
of choice.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Most unreasonable is
their conduct who, in the beginning of sickness,
drive away all serious thoughts from the
soul, through a fear of injuring the body.
Even if this were necessarily the case, the risk
is so far less in dying soon than in dying unprepared,
that the former danger should be
cheerfully encountered rather than incur the
possibility of the latter. But the cases of sickness
are very few in which, at the beginning
of a disorder, such religious considerations
can do our bodily health any harm. On the
contrary, that awe and tranquillity of soul
which are induced by them may in many
cases be of real advantage.&mdash;<i>Heber.</i></p></div>

<h3 class="tdc" id="o328"><span class="smcap">Distress in Prospect of Death.</span></h3>

<p class="bq">xxxviii.&nbsp;2, 3. <i>Then Hezekiah turned his face toward the wall, &amp;c.</i></p>

<p>The causes of Hezekiah&rsquo;s reluctance
to die may be gathered from his circumstances.
{See Outline: <a href="#o327"><i>Hezekiah&rsquo;s
Prayer,</i></a> p. 426.] That ungodly men
should be terrified at death is what
might be expected (P.&nbsp;D. 684); but
<span class="pagenum" id="p431">[p.&nbsp;431]</span>
reluctance to die is not confined to
them (H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I. 1570).</p>

<p>I. <i>The Christian has naturally a feeling
of repugnance at the very thought of
the disruption of the union between soul
and body.</i> What precedes death, the
stroke itself, and its consequences, all
excite feelings of dread (P.&nbsp;D. 741,
761).</p>

<p>II. <i>True believers may feel reluctant to
die because of the doubts which they entertain
with respect to their eternal state.</i>
After death is the judgment. Their
fears may proceed from various causes.
From constitutional temperament, increased
by a relaxed state of the nervous
system; from the prevalence of
unbelief, the imperfection of knowledge
and faith in the Lord Jesus
Christ; from the powerful agency of
the god of this world in producing
them. A last desperate effort is made
to overthrow faith. While these prevail,
recovery from bodily distress is
felt to be a mercy of no ordinary kind
(H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I. 323).</p>

<p>III. <i>Religion may be in a declining
state in them, and a consciousness of this
may render the prospect of death distressing
to them.</i> The progress of the Christian
is not uniform. If, while in a
backward state, he is called to die,
conscience is awakened, and he is
thrown into alarm (Matt. xxv.&nbsp;1&ndash;13).</p>

<p>IV. <i>The prospect of death may be distressing,
because the believer will then be
deprived of all opportunity of honouring
God in this world.</i> This was one reason
for Hezekiah&rsquo;s unwillingness to die.
He was in the prime of life. Believers,
at a like time, may pray to live in
order to be useful in the Church and
world. The prayer proceeds from a
right principle&mdash;a desire to honour
God. It seems hard for the minister
of Christ, after a long course of laborious
preparation, to be smitten down
to die before he has well begun the
great work of preaching. The philanthropist,
like Howard, feels a bitterness
in the stroke. The Christian
parent also. In these and like circumstances
a rare strength of faith is
called for.</p>

<p>V. <i>God may see good to withhold from
true believers the comforts of religion under
bodily distress and in their dying moments.</i>
To what is the difference in the
measure of comfort enjoyed on a death-bed
to be ascribed? The sovereignty
of God must here be admitted. Objection
against it here applies equally in
other circumstances. The Divine reasons
may be inscrutable to man, although
assuredly dictated by infinite
wisdom. The newly converted may die
joyfully; the veteran Christian may
have much less comfort. But generally
the faithful life will end, at least,
in a peaceful death (H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I. 1264).</p>

<p>Would you meet death without
terror? 1.&nbsp;<i>Improve by faith that righteousness
which Christ wrought out in our
nature.</i> 2.&nbsp;<i>See to it that your hearts are
changed by the Spirit of God.</i> 3.&nbsp;<i>Devote
yourselves unreservedly and unweariedly
to the cultivation of holiness in heart and
life.</i> The longer we are here, we are
the more prone to get our hearts upon
the world as if it were our rest. It
is from this tendency that the aged
Christian sometimes feels as great a
reluctance to depart as the Christian
in the morning of life (Col. iii.&nbsp;2).&mdash;<i>James
Anderson: Scottish Christian Herald,</i>
iii. 569.</p>

<h3 class="tdc" id="o329"><span class="smcap">The Shortening of Human Life.</span></h3>

<p class="tdc">(<i>A Funeral Sermon.</i>)</p>

<p class="bq">xxxviii.&nbsp;10. <i>I am deprived of the residue of my years.</i></p>

<p>Briefly narrate the facts of Hezekiah&rsquo;s
illness. The words of the text
naturally suggest this general observation,
that God deprives many of
the human race of the residue of their
years.</p>

<p>I. <span class="smcap">When God deprives any of
mankind of the residue of their
years.</span></p>

<p>1. <i>When He calls them out of the
world before they have reached the limits
of life which are to be found in Scripture</i>
<span class="pagenum" id="p432">[p.&nbsp;432]</span>
(Ps. xc.&nbsp;10). Hezekiah undoubtedly
numbered his years according to this
standard when he spoke (at forty
years of age) of being deprived of the
residue of his years. 2.&nbsp;<i>When He
calls them out of the world before they
have reached the bounds of life fixed by
Providence.</i> Thought the Scriptures
limit life to seventy or eighty years,
yet Providence often extends it to
a longer period, even to a century.
Many aged persons enjoy a large
measure of health, strength, and activity;
should any of these be suddenly
cut down by disease or accident, they
would be deprived of the residue of
their years which they had anticipated,
according to the course of Divine providence
in fixing the limits of life to
the aged. 3.&nbsp;<i>Even those who die before
they have reached the bounds of life which
are imposed by the laws of Nature, may
be said to be deprived of the residue of
their days.</i> Nature sets bounds to
every kind of life in this world, not
excepting human life. What the natural
limit of human life is we cannot
tell, but from the fact that some have
survived for over a century and a half,
we may infer that God has deprived
the vast majority of the human race of
the residue of their years, and has not
allowed even one in a million to reach
the bounds of life which Nature has set.</p>

<p>II. <span class="smcap">Why God thus shortens the
lives of man and cuts off their
expected years.</span></p>

<p>1. Sometimes it is <i>to teach the living
that He is not dependent on them in
the least degree.</i> Though He can and
does employ them in His service, yet
He can lay them aside whenever He
pleases, and carry on His designs
without their assistance. Let eminent
and useful men like Hezekiah remember
this, that they may not yield to
the temptation of pride (H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I.
2218&ndash;2219). 2.&nbsp;In order <i>to teach mankind
their constant and absolute</i> dependence
upon Himself. This they are
extremely inclined to forget, and their
forgetfulness arises in a great measure
from the consideration of the general
bounds of life which Scripture, Providence,
and Nature have set. To these
well-known periods they naturally extend
their views, desires, and expectations.
But to make them sensible
that they still live, move, and have
their being in Himself, God continually
deprived one and another, and
much the larger portion of mankind,
of the residue of their years. 3.&nbsp;<i>To
teach the living the necessity of being
continually prepared for another life</i>
(H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I. 1543&ndash;1546). 4.&nbsp;<i>To teach the
living the importance of faithfully improving
life as long as they enjoy it.</i>
All men are naturally slothful and
strongly inclined to postpone present
duties to a more convenient season.
The best and most industrious of men
need the sharp spur of the possibility
of sudden death, and of being called
away before their work is complete.
When God cuts down the active and
useful in the midst of their days, He
warns us most solemnly (Eccl. ix.&nbsp;10;
H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I. 1562&ndash;1566). 5.&nbsp;God sometimes
cuts short the days of the wicked
<i>to prevent their doing evil in the time to come</i>
(Ps. lv.&nbsp;23; Prov. x.&nbsp;27; Eccl. vii.&nbsp;17).
6.&nbsp;God sometimes shortens the lives
of His faithful servants to prevent
their seeing and suffering public calamities.
It seems to have been in
mercy to Hezekiah that God added
only fifteen years to his life; had fifty
years been added (and then at death
he would only have been ninety), he
would have been involved in the dreadful
evils which were coming upon both
his family and his kingdom (Isa.
lvii.&nbsp;1).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Application.</span>&mdash;1.&nbsp;If God does not
always deprive men of the residue of
their years, <i>there is a propriety in praying
for the lives of the aged as well as for
the lives of the young.</i> Even the oldest
persons living, though labouring under
pains, infirmities, and diseases which
seem to indicate the near approach of
death, may yet pray for the removal
or mitigation of their disorders, and
for a longer space of life. Life is a
blessing, and to pray for its continuance
is a duty. 2.&nbsp;If God so often
deprives men of the residue of their
years, <i>it is extremely unreasonable and
dangerous to flatter ourselves with the</i>
<span class="pagenum" id="p433">[p.&nbsp;433]</span>
<i>hope of living a great while in the world.</i>
What ground have we to expect that
our days will be greatly prolonged;
that <i>we</i> shall escape all the dangers
and diseases which have proved so
fatal to others, and live as long as
men can live according to the course
of nature? This expectation is as dangerous
as it is absurd. It encourages
the wicked to continue in sin. It is
the strangest and most fatal error that
mankind ever embraced (James iv.&nbsp;14;
Matt. xxii.&nbsp;44). 3.&nbsp;Since God deprives
so many of the residue of their years,
<i>we ought to beware of placing too much
dependence upon the lives of others, as
well as of our own.</i> Others are as liable
to leave us as we are to leave them
(Ps. cxlvi.&nbsp;3&ndash;5). 4.&nbsp;If God so often
deprives men of the residue of their
years, then <i>long life is a great as well as
a distinguishing favour.</i> It is a talent
capable of being improved to the
highest public and private advantage
We should desire it for the sake of
having greater opportunity of getting
good, and still more of doing good.
Had Hezekiah, Joseph, Joshua, Caleb,
and David died in early manhood, how
little comparatively they could have
done for Israel! Since good men are
to be rewarded according to their
works, the longer they are permitted
to live, the greater opportunity they
enjoy of promoting their own future
blessedness. 5.&nbsp;If God always has
wise and good reasons for depriving
men of the residue of their years, then
<i>it is as reasonable to submit to His providence
in one instance of mortality as
another.</i> He knows all the disappointment
which a strong man feels in being
cut down in the midst of his days, all
acute sorrow that is caused by an untimely
death and He sympathises with
it all. He never afflicts willingly, nor
grieves the children of men; He takes
no pleasure in giving anxiety and distress
to the dying, nor in desolating
the hearts of the living; and when He
does either, it is for a reason that is
infinitely wise and infinitely kind. It
behoves us then to say with Job: (Job xiii.&nbsp;15,
or Job i.&nbsp;21).&mdash;<i>Dr. Emmons: Works,</i>

From many sick-beds it still ascends.
1.&nbsp;From the sick-bed of the Christian
who is distressed by thoughts of what

that the world has been gaining
much on his heart. Overtaken in
the very strength and flower of his
days by a sudden and dangerous illness,
he sees that in the midst of the

he has gradually drawn off
from a life of watchfulness and prayer,
and that, while keeping the forms of
godliness, he has lost much of its
power. Death apparently at hand,

the sick-bed of the worldly man, who
at length perceives his guilt and

<p class="bq">xxxviii.&nbsp;14. <i>Undertake for me.</i></p>

<p><b>I. That man needs a surety.</b> This
is evident from several considerations.
Man&mdash;1.&nbsp;<i>Is an insolvent debtor;</i> 2.&nbsp;<i>a
captive;</i> 3.&nbsp;<i>a criminal;</i> 4.&nbsp;<i>helpless and
mortal.</i></p>

<p><b>II. That a surety has been provided</b>
(Heb. vii.&nbsp;22, viii.&nbsp;6, ix.&nbsp;15,
xii.&nbsp;24). Christ was constituted a
surety; not <i>for God to us,</i> but <i>for us to
God.</i> He undertook to do for us, and
in us, what we could not do for ourselves.
Is man a debtor? Christ has
paid the debt. Is man a captive?
Christ came to set the captive free. Is
man a criminal? Christ has endured
the curse (Isa. liii.&nbsp;6; 2&nbsp;Cor. v.&nbsp;21).
Is man helpless and mortal? Christ
has provided everlasting strength (2&nbsp;Cor.
xii.&nbsp;9).</p>

<p><b>III. That there must be a believing
application made to that Surety.</b> We
must put in claim for share in the
suretyship of Christ&mdash;must say in
faith, &ldquo;Lord, undertake for me; be
surety for me.&rdquo;</p>

<p><b>IV. The effects of such application.</b>
These are many and most important.
In case of Hezekiah several are mentioned.
God had sent him an alarming
message. He wept and called
upon God. His prayer was answered.
A sign was given. During his sickness
and after his recovery he had
great exercises of soul. He thought
of death (ver. 10); was annoyed because
he was about to be cut off from
the worship of God (ver. 11), and that
by a premature death (ver. 12). But
was there not a <i>remedy</i>? Yes. <i>What?</i>
A believing application to the Lord
as surety. &ldquo;O Lord, I am oppressed;
undertake for me.&rdquo; And what was
the <i>consequence</i>? The whole tone of
his thoughts was changed. He now
recognises God&rsquo;s hand in the dispensation
(ver. 15); sees these things to
be good for his soul (ver. 16); believes
his recovery certain&mdash;realises the forgiveness
of sin&mdash;is enabled to praise
God (ver. 19); can now resolve to
teach his children about God&rsquo;s truth
and determine with them to bless and
magnify God for ever (vers. 19, 20).
Thus the realisation of God as surety,
and a believing application to Him
for help, proved the <i>turning-point</i> for
good in Hezekiah&rsquo;s experience.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Application.</span>&mdash;1.&nbsp;<i>In the way of
warning.</i> (1.)&nbsp;Not to depend on ourselves
for salvation. (2.)&nbsp;Not to
neglect the means of grace. 2.&nbsp;<i>In
the way of encouragement.</i> (1.)&nbsp;Jesus
Christ is surety for all who believe
in Him. (2.)&nbsp;All who are oppressed

<h3 class="tdc" id="o332"><span class="smcap">Hezekiah&rsquo;s Resolution.</span></h3>

<p class="tdc">(<i>A New-Year Motto.</i>)</p>

<p class="bq">xxxviii.&nbsp;15&ndash;20. <i>I shall go softly all my years, &amp;c.</i></p>

<p>This resolution grows out of that
singular experience of sickness and
recovery recorded in the preceding
verses. It furnishes an excellent
<span class="pagenum" id="p435">[p.&nbsp;435]</span>
motto for the year. Our translation
is somewhat defective, but if we substitute
<i>&ldquo;on&rdquo;</i> for <i>&ldquo;in,&rdquo;</i> the correct
sense will be clear. The meaning is
that the recovered king would walk
through the fifteen years that were
added to his life in salutary remembrance
of his dangerous illness, and
of the goodness of God in prolonging
his days on earth. The memory of
that trouble and of the mercy that
rescued him would put a staff in his
hand to make his walk more devoted,
circumspect, and consistent. Understood
thus, the words are applicable
to all. Some of you may be able to
trace a close resemblance between
your experience and that of Hezekiah.
Like him, you may have escaped from
a well-nigh fatal illness. But all of
us can look back on similar periods&mdash;on
mercies received and dangers
averted&mdash;and in recollection of them
we may say, &ldquo;I shall go softly all my
years <i>on</i> the bitterness of my soul.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I do not know any better commentary
on these words than the opening
stanza of Tennyson&rsquo;s <i>In Memoriam</i>:&mdash;</p>

<p class="bqpoemr">
&ldquo;Men may rise on stepping-stones<br />
&nbsp;Of their dead selves to higher things.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A good New Year&rsquo;s motto, which
harmonises so sweetly with it. Our
past experiences, our dead selves, may
be made stepping-stones on which we
may climb to a clearer vision and a
loftier devotion. What, then, was the
nature of that pathway of life which
this good king engaged to pursue?
What was the prospect which opened
up before him?</p>

<p>1. <i>A walk of humble dependence on
God.</i> This element in the resolution
is distinctly expressed. In vers. 15,
16, God&rsquo;s Word and acts are viewed
as the real supports of life. Looking
above all secondary causes and natural
agencies, the king acknowledges God
as the Source and Giver of life. This
is a great lesson, and one which an
experience like that of Hezekiah can
teach. It seems to us a natural thing
to live on; we count on continued
health and long life till some sickness
lays us low, and we are brought to
feel as we never felt before that our
times are in God&rsquo;s hand. But whether
we have passed through a dangerous
illness or not, the resolution befits us
all. Let us remember that God sustains
and orders our lives.</p>

<p>It was, indeed, a singular position
in which Hezekiah was placed. He
knew precisely how long he would
live. The duration of our pilgrimage
is just as fixed as his was, only we do
not know it (P.&nbsp;D. 2252). The thread
of our life is in God&rsquo;s hand. Thus
was Hezekiah taught to &ldquo;go softly.&rdquo;
His soul had passed through &ldquo;great
bitterness,&rdquo; and he shall bear it in
mind, and his rescue from it deepen
his dependence on God.</p>

<p>2. <i>A walk of usefulness.</i> It was on
this plea that he had prayed for the
prolongation of his life (ver. 3). He
had rendered valuable service and
had borne a consistent testimony.
The convalescent king saw a prospect
of further work for God on earth.
He who a short time before this
seemed about to leave his kingdom
in confusion without an heir to the
throne is now able to say, &ldquo;The father
of the children shall make known thy
truth.&rdquo; Does it not become us to ask,
Why is my life prolonged? Why have
I been permitted to enter on a new
year? Is it not for this reason, among
others, that we may become increasingly
serviceable in advancing the cause
of truth? Better far that life should
terminate than that we should live to
no purpose, for every year adds to our
responsibilities. Advance, then, into
this year resolved that, God sparing
you, you will live more useful lives
(H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I. 3228&ndash;3251; P.&nbsp;D. 2269).</p>

<p>3. <i>A walk of thankfulness</i> (vers. 19,
20). How thankful this convalescent
was for his restoration to health, and
all the more so because to him, as to
other saints of his age, the grave
seemed dark and gloomy (ver. 18). It
needed the Gospel of Christ&rsquo;s resurrection
to dispel the darkness and the
gloom. This psalm is itself a proof
of Hezekiah&rsquo;s thankful spirit, and perhaps
the 118th Psalm is another production
of his pen, containing as it
does words of hope suitable to this
<span class="pagenum" id="p436">[p.&nbsp;436]</span>
period of his history (Ps. cxviii.&nbsp;17,
18). Are we too resolved that our
remaining years shall be years of
thanksgiving, our lives a psalm of
praise?</p>

<p>4. This fifteen years&rsquo; walk was to be
<i>a walk of peace</i> (ver. 17). The meaning
here is that the affliction was sent with
a view to his obtaining a more settled
and abiding peace; it teaches us, as
nothing else can, the secret of inward
peace. What are the sources of dispeace?
One of them is found&mdash;(1.)&nbsp;In
our <i>earthly strivings and ambitions.</i>
&ldquo;There is no peace to the wicked.&rdquo;
He is constantly on the rack of avaricious
struggles, unsatisfied longings,
sensual desires. Affliction can show
us the utter vanity of earthly things.
How poor the world looks as seen
from within the curtains of a dying
bed! The sufferer who has come back
from the gates of death is able to
estimate earthly things at their right
value. He ceases from the low ambitions
and carnal desires that once
raged within him. (2.)&nbsp;<i>Bodily pain and
weakness</i> is another cause of unrest.
An experience of this bitterness
brings peace when the patient is
restored to health. We set greater
value on a blessing which we have
lost and regained. One of our poets
describes a convalescent gathering
strength, and coming forth after long
confinement to look upon the scenes
of Nature&mdash;</p>

<p class="bqpoemr">
&ldquo;The common earth and air and skies<br />
&nbsp;To him are opening paradise!&rdquo;</p>

<p>To have such feelings we must have
known affliction. For the enjoyment
of this peace we must have tasted
&ldquo;great bitterness.&rdquo; (3.)&nbsp;But the greatest
source of dispeace is <i>unpardoned sin</i>
(ver. 17). How complete is the forgiveness
of sin as thus expressed!
What a peace is enjoyed when guilt
is removed and God&rsquo;s love shed abroad
in our hearts! (H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I. 1893, 1894;
P.&nbsp;D. 2675, 2677).</p>

<p>What more do we need to make
this year a happy one than to set
forward with this resolution? We
cannot break away from the past.
We are now what it has made us.
Our &ldquo;dead selves&rdquo; make our living
present selves. From our trials and
sorrows we may gain supports for
nobler endeavour. &ldquo;I shall go softly,&rdquo;
meekly, submissively, prayerfully, &ldquo;on
the bitterness of my soul.&rdquo; Do you
wish some spring, some impulse to
send you forward thus in life&rsquo;s pathway?
Think of some bitterness in
your past experience, some Marah
which the Lord sweetened for you,
some trouble from which He rescued
you when you lay on the brink of
death, or under the accusations of
a troubled conscience, and make that
&ldquo;dead self&rdquo; a support for the path
before you.&mdash;<i>William Guthrie, M.A.</i></p>

<h3 class="tdc" id="o333"><span class="smcap">The Restoration of Belief.</span></h3>

<p class="bq">xxxviii.&nbsp;15. <i>I shall go softly all my years, &amp;c.</i></p>

<p>In the case of Hezekiah, belief was
restored by a great shock which brought
him into contact with reality. He had
been living, as many of us live, a pleasant,
prosperous life, till he had really
grown to believe that this world and
its interests were the only things worth
caring for. His treasures, his art collections,
the beauty of his palace, made
him love his life and dream that it was
not a dream. God appeared to him
not as to Adam, in the cool of the day,
but as He came to Job, in the whirlwind
and the eclipse, and Hezekiah
knew that he had been living in a vain
show. The answer of his soul was
quick and sad, &ldquo;By these things men
live, O Lord;&rdquo; these are the blows
which teach men what life really is.</p>

<p>Many are prosperous, happy, and at
ease. It will be wise for these to remember
that thoughtless prosperity
weakens the fibre of the soul (H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I.
3997&ndash;4014).</p>

<p>The blow which sobered Hezekiah
was a common one. It did nothing more
<span class="pagenum" id="p437">[p.&nbsp;437]</span>
than bring him face to face with death.
The process whereby his dependence on
God was restored was uncomplicated.
But there are far worse shocks than
this, and recovery from them into a
godlike life is long and dreadful.</p>

<p>1. One of these is the advent of irrecoverable
disease&mdash;protracted weakness
or protracted pain. Then we ask what
we have done: we curse our day. But
our misfortune brings round us the
ministering of human tenderness:
slowly the soul becomes alive to love;
and through the benign influence of
human love the first step towards the
restoration of belief has been made,
the soil is prepared for the work of the
Spirit of God. Then the Gospel story
attracts and softens the sufferer&rsquo;s heart.
Afterwards he reads that Christ&rsquo;s suffering
brought redemption unto man,
and begins to realise how he can fill
up what is behindhand of the sufferings
of Christ. This is not only the restoration
of belief&mdash;it is the victory of life.</p>

<p>2. More dreadful than protracted
disease is that shipwreck which comes
of dishonoured love&mdash;</p>

<p class="bqpoemr">
&ldquo;When all desire at last, and all regret,<br />
&nbsp;Go hand in hand to death, and all is vain,<br />
&nbsp;What shall assuage the unforgotten pain,<br />
&nbsp;And teach the unforgetful to forget!&rdquo;</p>

<p>For some there is no remedy but
death. Others live on in a devouring
memory. And the memory poisons all
belief in God. But there are many
who recover, and emerge into peace
and joy. Can we at all trace how this
may be? Lapse of time does part of
the work. It does not touch the
memory of love. The pain of having
a gift thrown aside has passed; the
sweetness of having given remains.
When we thought ourselves farthest
from God, we were unconsciously
nearest to Him. And so we are saved,
faith is restored. Like Christ, we can
say, &ldquo;Father, forgive them, for they
knew not what they did.&rdquo;</p>

<p>3. Many are conscious, in later life,
that their early faith has passed away.
It was unquestioning, enthusiastic. It
depended much on those we loved.
Religious feelings which had been without
us and not within, slowly and
necessarily died away. Becoming more
and more liberal, we also become more
and more unbelieving, and at last
realised that our soul was empty. Are
we to settle down into that? It is
suicide, not sacrifice, which abjures immortality
and prefers annihilation.
Our past belief was borrowed too much
from others. Resolve to accept of no
direction which will free you from the
invigorating pain of effort. Free yourself
from the cant of infidelity. It
boasts of love, it boasts of liberality.
Its church is narrower than our strictest
sect. Bring yourself into the relation
of a child to a father. We need to
come to our second self, which is a
child&mdash;to possess a childhood of feeling
in the midst of manhood.&mdash;<i>Stopford

<p class="bq">xxxviii.&nbsp;17. <i>Thou hast in love to my soul delivered it from the pit of corruption:
for Thou hast cast all my sins behind Thy back.</i></p>

<p>The text forms part of a king&rsquo;s song
on recovering from a severe illness.
&ldquo;When we are raised from deep distress,
our God deserves a song.&rdquo; But
it points beyond temporal deliverance
to salvation from the power and punishment
of sin.</p>

<p>I. <span class="smcap">The sinner&rsquo;s condition.</span></p>

<p>In &ldquo;the pit of corruption.&rdquo; This
description suggests&mdash;1.&nbsp;<i>Loathsomeness.</i>
It is a fit simile of the world in which
the unconverted live. It is not a
quagmire, but a pit; not a dry pit,
but one full of corruption&mdash;filth, death,
worms. To God, &ldquo;glorious in holiness,&rdquo;
every man in the pit of corruption
must be loathsome. He may be
educated, loving, philanthropic, and
worldly wise, but being <i>dead in trespasses
and sins,</i> he is fit only for being
buried out of the sight of God and
good men. 2.&nbsp;<i>Helplessness.</i> A man
<span class="pagenum" id="p438">[p.&nbsp;438]</span>
in a pit is helpless, like Joseph. No
man ever yet got out of the pit of
corruption by his Latin, his logic, or
his mother wit. It is not for him to
postpone the date of a deliverance
once vouchsafed. 3.&nbsp;<i>Increasing danger.</i>
Men never mend in the pit.</p>

<p>II. <span class="smcap">The sinner&rsquo;s helper.</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Thou,&rdquo; &amp;c. In vain does the
sinner look within himself or to his
fellow-men for help, but God gives it.
Every saint praises God for his salvation:
<i>&ldquo;Thou,&rdquo;</i> &amp;c. Note, 1.&nbsp;The <i>freeness</i>
of God&rsquo;s redeeming love. There
is nothing in a man wallowing in a pit
of corruption to draw out love. Where
it is shown, it is a free gift. 2.&nbsp;The
<i>fulness</i> of that love. &ldquo;Thou hast cast
all my sins behind Thy back.&rdquo; Some
wink at our sins others cast them into
our teeth on all occasions. God does
neither. He abhors sin, but when He
forgives the sinner, He forgets the sin
(Jer. l.&nbsp;20; Rom. viii.&nbsp;33; Ps. xxxii.&nbsp;2;
H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I. 2322&ndash;2337).</p>

<p>III. <span class="smcap">The sinner&rsquo;s duty.</span></p>

<p>He is not to lie quiet, but to cry for
a deliverer. Wishing, hoping, thinking
will not do. The crying, to be
effectual, must be made <i>now.</i> Now
God says, &ldquo;My arm is not shortened,&rdquo;
&amp;c. (lix.&nbsp;1). When once gone, to all
your cries His reply will be, &ldquo;Because
I called,&rdquo; &amp;c. (Prov. i.&nbsp;24&ndash;26).</p>

<p>Why will you die? Bring forth
your strong reasons against salvation.&mdash;<i>M.:

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 class="tdc" id="o335"><span class="smcap">Forgiveness of Sin.</span></h3>

<p class="bq">xxxviii.&nbsp;17. <i>For Thou hast cast all my sins behind Thy back.</i></p>

<p>This is part of the song which Hezekiah
wrote when he had recovered
from his sickness. He had betaken
himself to prayer. The nation, threatened
with invasion from the powerful
kingdom of Assyria, could ill afford to
lose its head. His prayer was heard.
The prophet was sent with a new message.
The Divine hand was visible,
although ordinary means were employed.
This the king fully recognised
(ver. 20). God&rsquo;s mercies should
not be forgotten when the occasion has
passed.</p>

<p>The king sees the connection of his
disease with sin, and the removal of
disease with the removal of his sins.
From the text we observe that the forgiveness
of sin is necessary, possible,
complete, knowable.</p>

<p><b>I. Forgiveness of sin is necessary.</b>
Scripture traces suffering to sin. The
fact of sin is prominent in the history
of mankind. Its universality is the
groundwork of the revelation of its
remedy. It is written on the conscience.
However, oblivious to the
fact in health and prosperity, men in
sickness and disaster usually think
of their sins as the remote or immediate
cause. It is sometimes God&rsquo;s
way of awakening attention (H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I.
56&ndash;89).</p>

<p>Until sin is forgiven, it is before the
face of God (Ps. xc.&nbsp;8; Heb. iv.&nbsp;13).
The accountability of men would be
an unmeaning phrase if it did not involve
the idea that an account is taken
of his actions. They are all noted,
good and bad, and tested by the Divine
standard. Every man&rsquo;s are before the
face of the Supreme Ruler and Judge
for the purpose of being dealt with.
This is his case until it is changed by
the exercise of forgiveness. It is useless
to ignore the need of forgiveness
under the impression that we can, in
some way, remove the stain. However
much good a man may do, the
fact of sin remains; and so long as he
is under a law which requires unsinning
obedience, the good cannot be set
against the bad in the hope that the
former will wipe the latter away. Forgiveness
of the past is the first necessity.</p>

<p><b>II. Forgiveness of sin is possible.</b>
The Gospel builds on the groundwork
laid. It provides and makes known a way
by which forgiveness may be obtained.
It is not by the enactment of a law
obedience to which will have this
<span class="pagenum" id="p439">[p.&nbsp;439]</span>
effect. Law brings the sinfulness into
clear relief and renders escape impossible.
Nor is it by the declaration of
a general amnesty, which would virtually
neutralise the law and its penalties.
Nor is it by an exercise of the
Divine sovereignty in the way of mercy
to all men, nor even to the penitent,
simply as such. God&rsquo;s way of forgiveness
provides for the exercise of mercy
by the satisfaction of the claims of
righteousness. For its manifestation
He prepared during long ages of teaching.
In due time He sent His Son
(Gal. iv.&nbsp;4, 5). The interposition of
Christ renders forgiveness possible.
It includes His taking the sinner&rsquo;s
obligations on Himself (Col. i.&nbsp;14).
This is the Divinely appointed way of
forgiveness. It satisfies all the requirements
of the case. It provides an
adequate Mediator. It provides forgiveness
on honourable terms. It is,
so far as the sinner is concerned, a
free forgiveness. It imposes no impossible
condition. It says to the
sinner under the burden of the law, which is
impossible to him, is no longer demanded,
because it has been rendered
by His great Substitute. It
simply calls upon him to believe, repenting
of his sins. If you see your
sinfulness, if your soul is troubled by
it, if you are anxious to obtain mercy,
the Gospel bids you come to Jesus, and
come at once. It assures a present,
immediate, free pardon.</p>

<p><b>III. Forgiveness of sin is complete.</b>
&ldquo;Thou hast cast all my sins behind
Thy back.&rdquo; They were previously
before the face of God. They are now
taken thence and cast behind His back.
You do that with a thing you have
done with and intend to see no more.
It is a most expressive representation
of the Divine forgiveness. It attracts
attention to its completeness. &ldquo;All
his sins,&rdquo; without exception or reservation,
have been cast out of sight.
They will never be produced against
him. This is complete forgiveness.
We can realise it better by comparison
with the forgiveness exercised by men.
Man&rsquo;s forgiveness is often very poor.
&ldquo;I can forgive, but I cannot forget.&rdquo;
&ldquo;I forgive, but I shall have no more to
do with that man.&rdquo; Many do not even
pretend to forgive. But God forgives,
completely, fully (H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I. 2328&ndash;2348).</p>

<p><b>IV. Forgiveness of sin is knowable.</b>
The text is the language of assurance.
Hezekiah inferred it from his
recovery. We may be certified&mdash;1.&nbsp;By
the written Word. 2.&nbsp;By consciousness
of the Spirit&rsquo;s work in us&mdash;repentance,
faith, love, surrender.
3.&nbsp;By the moral effects. Put all these
together (H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I. 309, 310, 324, &amp;c.)</p>

<p>Do you possess assurance? Your
experience&mdash;1.&nbsp;Illustrates the Divine
character: &ldquo;merciful and gracious.&rdquo;
Its most attractive light. 2.&nbsp;Produces
grateful love. The greatest boon has
won the heart. 3.&nbsp;Invites to holy
obedience. Appeals to what is best.
4.&nbsp;Suggests evangelic action. Tell
others. Seek the salvation of the
worst.</p>

<p>Are you not forgiven? Perhaps indifferent.
Perhaps desirous, but hesitating.
Perhaps procrastinating. Do
not trifle. Do not neglect. Do not
delay. Be reconciled to God.&mdash;<i>J. Rawlinson.</i></p>

<h3 class="tdc" id="o336"><span class="smcap">The Song of Hezekiah.</span></h3>

<p class="tdc">(<i>Sermon to the Young.</i>)</p>

<p class="bq">xxxviii.&nbsp;18, 19. <i>For the grave cannot praise Thee, &amp;c.</i></p>

<p>This is part of Hezekiah&rsquo;s song of
praise to God. He was very ill. A
good man, yet rather afraid of death;
certainly very anxious to live. When
we are strong and full of life, it is easy
to talk of braving all worldly sorrows;
but when the time comes for us to
prove our words, many who are now
in heaven have said, &ldquo;Spare me a
little before I go hence and be no
<span class="pagenum" id="p440">[p.&nbsp;440]</span>
more seen.&rdquo; In what affecting terms
did Hezekiah bewail his sickness! &ldquo;I
said, in the cutting off my days.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
I shall not see the Lord,&rdquo; in His holy
sanctuary on earth; &ldquo;I shall behold
man no more;&rdquo; never again behold
the human face divine, never meet
again the welcoming smile of child or
friend.</p>

<p>God heard Hezekiah&rsquo;s prayer, took
pity upon him, turned back the sundial
of his life fifteen years. The good
king rejoiced in this gift of lengthened
life: &ldquo;The grave cannot praise
Thee,&rdquo; &amp;c.</p>

<p>Let us follow out this rejoicing of
the king, this setting forth the advantages
of the living above the dead.
1.&nbsp;The living are in possession of the
time which is given to make reconciliation
with God and secure an everlasting
interest. We are all by nature
strangers to God, enemies to Him in
our mind and inclination. We are
defiled and guilty creatures; this is
the hour of cleansing, whilst the fountain
stands open in which our sins
may be washed away (2&nbsp;Cor. vi.&nbsp;2).
We are by nature utterly unfit for
heaven; this is the day of repentance
as well as of pardon. At the summons
of death we must go, whether
prepared or unprepared, holy or unholy,
hoping or despairing. While
your hearts were unholy, your death,
had it happened, must have been
dreadful. Let those who have improved
this gift of life to make their
reconciliation with God highly value
it, and magnify its important advantages
with all the gratitude and zeal
of the king of Judah. 2.&nbsp;Life is a
precious and golden gift, because it
affords a field for increasing in good
works. We are required to be &ldquo;zealous
of good works.&rdquo; <i>Zealous;</i> not to
touch a good work as if we were afraid
of burning our fingers. Such works
&ldquo;are good and profitable to men.&rdquo;
The days and years of life should be
numbered by the multitude of good
works, as by the revolutions of the
earth. Lost and wasted time should
not come into the account of life.
Ah! if we reckoned thus, what a
shrinking and contracting would take
place! A Roman emperor, a heathen,
used to say, &ldquo;I have lost a day,&rdquo; if
he had not done any good action in
it. How many are there who live to
no purpose at all, whom the world
will not miss when they are gone!
How many live to wicked purposes,
and the world is glad to get rid of
them! Some are mere cumberers of
the ground; they bear the Christian
name, but how different from Christ!
&ldquo;The night cometh,&rdquo; said He, &ldquo;in
which no man can work.&rdquo; &ldquo;Ye are
the light of the world,&rdquo; said Christ to
His disciples, and how dark would
this earth be were there no disciples
of Christ upon it! &ldquo;Ye are,&rdquo; said
He, &ldquo;the salt of the earth;&rdquo; if the
salt were gone, what corruption of
manners, what filthy communications,
what odious practices would overspread
and defile society! One child
of God in a family is like the ark in
the house of Obed-Edom, of which we
read, &ldquo;The Lord hath blessed the
house of Obed-Edom,&rdquo; &amp;c.; or like
Joseph in Potiphar&rsquo;s house, of whom
we read, &ldquo;The Lord blessed the
Egyptian&rsquo;s house for Joseph&rsquo;s sake,&rdquo;
&amp;c. We may follow up this idea, and
say if one child of God is so great a
blessing in a family, many may bless
and save whole cities and nations.
We find this to have actually been the
case from what is said of Noah, Daniel,
and Job. God said three thousand
years ago, &ldquo;Righteousness exalteth a
nation,&rdquo; and it is equally certain that
wickedness overthroweth it. In all
the Old Testament history, we see
how He ascribes prosperity to the
keeping of His commandments, and
ruin to the breaking of them. We
cannot suppose that it is in any way
different now; that the Ruler of the
Universe is in slumber, or, being
awake, has altered the rules of His
government. Life, and especially
youthful life, is the time for good
works and good actions; not one can
be done in the grave.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Conclusion.</span>&mdash;Let young persons
value life. It has been said that we
&ldquo;take no note of time save from its
<span class="pagenum" id="p441">[p.&nbsp;441]</span>
loss;&rdquo; let not this be said of you. It
is the gift of <i>time</i> that alone places
you in a position to profit by all other
gifts. Make good use of life; of this
its pleasant morning; be obedient, be
diligent, love each other, avoid quarrelling
and evil words. Live so that
the end will conduct you to a world
where, though time will be no longer,
life will continue for ever.&mdash;<i>George

<p>Such was Hezekiah&rsquo;s burst of thankfulness
when God heard his prayer,
and gave him fifteen years more of
life. While the danger lasted, he was
surprised into more of alarm than became
his place and character; but now,
marvellously spared, he calls upon the
living everywhere to praise God for
His goodness. <i>His</i> case, he feels, was
<i>theirs</i> too. All men alike live upon
God&rsquo;s bounty, and are debtors to His
patience. He guards them from evil,&mdash;sends
them good things, without
which life must be presently extinguished,&mdash;renews
their being, and
makes it over to them by a fresh grant,
not only when the closing year reminds
us of the gift, but at each day&rsquo;s working
time. Therefore Hezekiah is not
satisfied with a solitary strain of
thanksgiving. He looks round upon
a world teeming with animated, intelligent
beings, and in every brother
who God hath made and kept alive
he finds one who should bring in his
tribute of praise. He wants a chorus
of rejoicing worshippers.</p>

<p>1. This season naturally makes us
thoughtful. We think of what life has
been to us lately, and what it might
have been. We have nearly passed
another stage on our journey to the
grave, and we miss some who began it
with us. We stand, like unwounded
soldiers on the battlefield with the
dead and the dying all round them.
This is all God&rsquo;s doing. He who gives
life sustains it. If to have lived on be
deemed a blessing, and praise for the
boon be due anywhere, it can only be
to Him whose providential government
of the world is like an hourly
repetition of the creative power which
called it out of nothing.</p>

<p>2. But is life worth having? Is
prolonged life a blessing, and may we
fairly require men to be grateful for
it? This is assumed by Hezekiah.
Life and praise may go well together,
because to so great a degree life and
happiness go together. Not always.
Some are so unhappy that they cry out
under their burden, and almost wish,
for a moment, for deliverance at any
cost. But the settled feeling of men&rsquo;s
minds is the other way. To almost
all of them life is the hoarded treasure
which they will guard at any price.
They will put up with the worst they
have to bear before they will accept
release on the terms of being banished
straightway to an unknown world.
The reason is, that by the side of this
harvest of woe, of which they reap a
few ears now and then, there groweth
a harvest of blessing, of which they are
constant reapers (P.&nbsp;D. 2282, 2256).</p>

<p>3. Remember the &ldquo;common mercies&rdquo;
of which through another year
we have been partakers. Our very
senses are so many curious inlets by
which pleasures, more or less vivid,
come thronging in from the wide world
around us. Continued health. Senses
and faculties marvellously kept from
injury. The happiness of our houses;
specially to be remembered at this
season. When we call upon the living
to praise God, we have much more to
show for the demand than the bare
fact that God lets them live. He lets
most of them live happily. He causes
their cup to run over with blessings.
He does all this, in spite of forgetfulness
<span class="pagenum" id="p442">[p.&nbsp;442]</span>
and disobedience on their part
that would wear out any other love but
His (H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I. 2307&ndash;2309). Praise God
for the &ldquo;common mercies&rdquo; of another
year.</p>

<p>4. While we live we are on mercy-ground.
<i>That</i> is the special mercy
beyond all our common mercies. Life,
while it lasts, connects us with all that
is blessed and glorious in the scheme
of salvation. While we are here,
&ldquo;there is but a step between us and
death;&rdquo; but while we are here, too,
the door stands wide open through
which we may pass into the presence-chamber
of our King. <i>While you are
here,</i> if you will make Christ your
friend, sin may be cast out, and the
blessed Spirit of truth become your
daily Teacher, and your future years
be all rich in blessing and bright with
hope. Praise God for the prolongation
to you of this great opportunity, and
embrace it now! Let the new year
find you serving Christ.</p>

<p>5. Living saints, as well as spared
sinners, should praise God for His preserving
mercy. They have had fresh
opportunities for serving God and for
growth in grace. They have no righteousness
of their own wherein to stand
before God, and never will have; but
talents improved and laid out for God
will bring a blessing. He is too bountiful
a Master to let any of His servants
work for nought. Heaven itself is not
alike to all, though it shall be satisfying
to the meanest child in God&rsquo;s family.
The disciple whom Jesus specially
loved leant on His bosom at the Last
Supper; and at the marriage-supper,
when all the guests shall be assembled
from many lands, they who have attained
to the godliest stature in their
days of conflict shall sit nearest to the
King, and wear the brightest crowns
(H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I. 2751&ndash;2753, 3288; P.&nbsp;D. 412,
1752). Every year is a fresh sowing-time
for a more abundant harvest.</p>

<p>6. Some among you have special
reasons for saying with Hezekiah, &ldquo;The
living,&rdquo; &amp;c. (1.)&nbsp;This strain belongs
to the aged man or woman, who has
already lived beyond the allotted term
of human life. In your feebleness, God
has carried you through another stage.
Beyond your expectation, perhaps, you
have seen another Christmas. Many
are the mercies of one year, but when
they come to be multiplied by near fourscore,
what an array we have then!
Praise the Lord! (2.)&nbsp;Some before me,
while the year was running out, thought
they should never see the end of it. Like
Hezekiah, you prayed for life when
death seemed to be close upon you. God
restored your life to you. What have
you done since to show yourself grateful
for that mercy? Have a care that your
mercies do not make your case worse.
If they do not melt, they harden.</p>

<p>7. If the living should praise God,
how largely is He defrauded of His
due! We are surrounded with living
men. Each one of these has a fresh
grant of life with each day&rsquo;s sun-rising.
What a tide of praise should be going
up unceasingly to His throne! Do we
find the world so full of praise? Alas!
no; if praise be the sign of life, we seem
to be walking among the tombs. God
is forgotten in His own world. While
common friends are thanked for trifling
favours, the Giver of mercies, repeated
with every breath, is to many of us an
unheeded stranger.&mdash;<i>John Hampton

<h3 class="tdc" id="o338"><span class="smcap">Hezekiah&rsquo;s Strength and Weakness.</span></h3>

<p class="bq">xxxix.&nbsp;1, 2. <i>At that time Merodach-baladan, &amp;c.</i></p>

<p>A study of the character of Hezekiah
is profoundly instructive. The
sacred writers impartially present him
to us in his strength and in his weakness.</p>

<p>I. <span class="smcap">Hezekiah in his strength.</span></p>

<p>He was in the full sense of the word
a good king (2&nbsp;Kings xviii.&nbsp;3, 5). He
was conspicuous&mdash;1.&nbsp;For his religious
zeal. Though, politically, it was a
hazardous thing to do, he utterly
abolished idolatry in his kingdom.
<span class="pagenum" id="p443">[p.&nbsp;443]</span>
2.&nbsp;For his religious wisdom (2&nbsp;Kings.
<span class="wsnw">xviii. 4).<a id="o338_fna1" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#o338_fn1">[1]</a></span>
3.&nbsp;For his strong faith.
This was shown especially in his conduct
in the matter of the siege of
Jerusalem by Sennacherib. When we
consider these things, we may well
understand the high praise given to
Hezekiah; certainly there were few
kings like him; perhaps none who exhibited
a ripeness of religious knowledge
and a strength of character so
remarkably superior to the times in
which he lived.</p>

<p>II. <span class="smcap">Hezekiah in his weakness.</span></p>

<p>The weakness of his character was
displayed&mdash;1.&nbsp;When the king of Babylon
sent messengers and a present to
him to congratulate him on his recovery
from his illness. Then he must needs
take them over his house and his armoury,
and parade before them all the
strength of his dominions (2&nbsp;Kings xx.&nbsp;12&ndash;13).
It was natural and right that
he should be pleased with the conduct of
the king of Babylon; it was gratifying
to him personally; it augured well for
the future, as concerning his kingdom,
that he should be on good terms with
the king of Babylon, now rising into
power; but it was unworthy of him to
lose his self-possession in the manner
described. (1.)&nbsp;He was evidently
overcome for the nonce by silly feelings
of vanity. He seems to have
thought that inasmuch as the king of
Babylon had considered him worthy
of the compliment of sending to him,
he on his part must show that he
was indeed a very magnificent king,
as the king of Babylon had no doubt
heard that he was. (2.)&nbsp;His vanity
caused him to forget how little service
his armoury and his treasures had
been to him in the hour of peril
(H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I. 3998, 4000, 4001, 4011).
(3.)&nbsp;His vanity caused him to forego
an opportunity of honouring God and
of instructing his neighbours in Divine
<span class="wsnw">truth.<a id="o338_fna2" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#o338_fn2">[2]</a></span>
Doubtless it was his failure
in duty in this respect that brought
upon him so severe a rebuke (vers.
3&ndash;7). 2.&nbsp;The weakness of his character
had already manifested itself in his
conduct during his illness. In the
prospect of death his strength of mind
quite broke down (ch. xxxviii.) But
there was a difference: in the other
case he acted unworthily of his knowledge;
in this case he was weak because
he was, compared with ourselves,
weak in religious privileges. He looked
to his grave with such melancholy
feelings because he could not clearly
see a life beyond it. The answer of
the great riddle of humanity had been
guessed by many before Christ, but
His resurrection made the truth clear
(2&nbsp;Tim. i.&nbsp;10; H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I. 3415). If it
were not for the light which our Lord
has thrown into the grave, we should
mourn like Hezekiah, and our eyes
would fail as did his. Having more
light than he had, it is our duty to
live a nobler life than he did, and not
to be cowards in prospect of death (H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I.
1570&ndash;1643).&mdash;<i>Harvey Goodwin,
M.A.: Plain Truth Sermons,</i> Third
Series, pp. 78&ndash;92.</p>

<div class="footnotes"><h4 class="tdc">FOOTNOTES:</h4>
<div class="footnote" id="o338_fn1"><p><a href="#o338_fna1"><span class="label">[1]</span></a>
Amongst other idolatrous forms of
worship which he destroyed, he broke in
pieces the brazen serpent which Moses had
made in the wilderness (2&nbsp;Kings xviii.&nbsp;4).
Many men would have been ready to destroy
all the heathen forms of idolatry; they would
have made no peace with Baal, or Dagon, or
any other gods of the nations, but they would
have hesitated to destroy a relic of the life
of Israel in the wilderness; they would have
thought it sacrilegious to break up an image
which Moses himself had made, and they
would have reasoned that the religious feelings
of the people were so entwined about
this memorial of their early days, that it
would do more harm than good to violate
their feelings, and take away that which
excited in their minds religious thoughts.
If a king of Judah had so argued, it would
not have seemed right to confound him with the
mere rabble of idolaters. If Hezekiah had
destroyed all other forms of idolatry and left
this remaining, we could easily have found an
excuse for his conduct; but forasmuch as he
took a higher view of his duty, we are bound
to give him credit for that higher view, and
to remark his spiritual discernment. Hezekiah
was not deceived by any flimsy arguments
about the sacred nature of the relic
which the people adored; it was a cause of
idolatry, that was enough. It had been sacred
once. In the wilderness, when it was held up
as an object upon which the people might
gaze, it would have been a sacrilege to mutilate
it; but now it was but &ldquo;a piece of brass,&rdquo;
and if that piece of brass be the centre of a
system of idolatry, there is but one safe course,
and that is to destroy it.&mdash;<i>Goodwin.</i></p></div>

<div class="footnote" id="o338_fn2"><p><a href="#o338_fna2"><span class="label">[2]</span></a>
If his purpose was to impress upon the
Babylonians the greatness of his strength, the
<span class="pagenum" id="p444">[p.&nbsp;444]</span>
story of the destruction of Sennacherib would
have answered his purpose much better. If
Hezekiah had taken the ambassadors to the
Temple, and told them how he had spread
Sennacherib&rsquo;s letter before the invisible presence
of his God in that holy house, and how
he had prayed that the designs of his enemy
might be brought to nought, and how that
eventually the Assyrians had all either perished
or fled, the men of Babylon would have been
far more impressed with the power of Hezekiah,
believing as they would that he was
under the protection of an unseen Hand, than
they possibly could be by the mere vulgar display
of treasures and armour, which their own
country would show in abundance, and which
was the very thing calculated to excite their
desire of plunder.&mdash;<i>Goodwin.</i></p></div>

<h3 class="tdc" id="o339"><span class="smcap">Home Life and Influence.</span></h3>

<p class="bq">xxxix.&nbsp;4. <i>What have they seen in Thy house?</i></p>

<p>State briefly the circumstances that
gave rise to this question. It evidently
suggests to Hezekiah that he has not
made the best use of the visit of the
Babylonians. He might have turned it
to greater account than the gratification
of his vanity by displaying his
treasures. Instead of magnifying the
greatness and glory of God, and thus
lifting the minds of his visitors to the
highest themes, he had only held out
a bait to their covetous desires, and
tempted them to steal the treasures so
vainly displayed. This was to be the
result of his folly (ver. 6). This is
how we miss the great opportunities
of our life. There come to us golden
seasons when we might bear valuable
testimony for God; but we have some
petty, personal desires of our own to
carry out, and they pass away unimproved.
Then comes the prophetic
message, borne by our own conscience,
that the plan we adopted to gratify our
improper desires will only lead us to
confusion and unhappiness.</p>

<p>The extent to which Hezekiah came
under the censure of God in this matter
we shall not now further consider.
We shall extend the application of this
question to the matter of <i>home life and
home influence.</i> So it has a bearing on
all of us. &ldquo;What have they seen in
<i>thy</i> house?&rdquo;</p>

<p>I. It should be seen that our home is
the common centre of attraction for all
the family (P.&nbsp;D. 1828&ndash;1830, 1836).</p>

<p>II. In the home each member of the
family should be seen faithfully discharging
the duties of his or her relationship
to it; husbands, wives, fathers, &amp;c.</p>

<p>III. It should be seen that every
Christian gift and grace is carefully
cultivated. &ldquo;For Christ&rsquo;s sake,&rdquo;
should be the motto of the whole
family. In all they do, every member
of it should seek to display love such
as He manifested when He dwelt
among us: His love was patient, magnanimous,
sympathetic. This is the
way to make the humblest home happy
(P.&nbsp;D. 1823, 1834, 1838, 1839).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Closing Reflections.</span>&mdash;1.&nbsp;If we
do not thus exhibit Christianity at
home, it may be questioned whether
we possess it at all (H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I. 2994).
2.&nbsp;If others know that there is no
practical Christianity displayed by us
at home, they will rightly set but little
value upon our religious performances
abroad. 3.&nbsp;It is from the culture of
home life that our hopes are to spring
with regard to the spiritual life. In
the home lurk the disorders that disturb
society. The true way to bring
these disorders to an end is to endeavour
to make the homes of our land
the nurseries of every Christian grace
and virtue. 4.&nbsp;Let us aim at the accomplishment
of the needful national
reforms, by each of us doing what we
can to make <i>our own home</i> all that it
ought to be.&mdash;<i>William Manning.</i></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 class="tdc" id="o340"><span class="smcap">Hezekiah Tried.</span></h3>

<p class="bq">xxxix.&nbsp;8. <i>Then said Hezekiah, &amp;c.</i></p>

<p>In the narrative connected with the
text we find much in Hezekiah to be
avoided and much worthy of imitation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="p445">[p.&nbsp;445]</span>
<b>I. We find Hezekiah in great affliction.</b>
He had recently escaped from
great public and national calamity;
he is speedily involved in private and
personal suffering (ch. xxxviii.&nbsp;1).
&ldquo;He was sick,&rdquo; and Isaiah was sent
to prepare him for death. He was
greatly alarmed at the approach of
death (ch. xxxviii.&nbsp;9&ndash;14) How different
from St. Paul (Phil. i.&nbsp;23). He
lived in a dark and imperfect dispensation;
few then had clear views of the
world to come (2&nbsp;Tim. i.&nbsp;10). Hezekiah&rsquo;s
faith failed him greatly, and he
clung to life with pertinacity.</p>

<p><b>II. In his trouble he sought the
Lord</b> (ch. xxxviii.&nbsp;2, 3). He made
solemn vows of what he would do if
spared (ch. xxxviii.&nbsp;15). When partially
restored, he renewed his vows
(ch. xxxviii.&nbsp;19). Thus believers in
every kind of trouble should seek
comfort of God in earnest prayer;
nor is it improper then solemnly to
give ourselves to God, and renew our
vows. We are encouraged to do this
by the speed with which a gracious
answer was sent to Hezekiah (ch.
xxxviii.&nbsp;4, 5). Isaiah was hardly
gone out from pronouncing the judgment
when he was sent back with a
message of mercy (2&nbsp;Kings xx.&nbsp;4&ndash;5).
How wonderfully compassionate is God
to His feeble people! Their poor,
trembling prayers, uttered in fear and
doubting, are heard and answered.
He not only hears prayer, but answers
directly (Dan. ix.&nbsp;20&ndash;23).</p>

<p><b>III. We find him speedily forgetful
of the mercy he had received.</b> Ambassadors
arrive at his court. Whence
and for what purpose? (vers. 1, 2).
What an opportunity for him to redeem
his vows, and to proclaim the
power and goodness of God to these
heathens! Alas! he shows them all
his riches, &amp;c., but of God and His
temple he says nothing. Flattered
and betrayed by the world (vers. 3, 4),
what a heart his and ours must be!
<i>How could this be?</i> We are told
(2&nbsp;Chron. xxxii.&nbsp;31) that such is man
when left to himself! We are never
in greater danger than after seasons
of great mercy and special providences
(H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I. 4902&ndash;4904).</p>

<p><b>IV. He humbly received the rebuke
that was sent to him</b> (text). Here
the habit of his mind appeared: he
had fallen into the sin of vanity, but
humility and resignation to the will
of God, especially to His afflicted
dispensations, were his usual characteristics.
A clear evidence of true
godliness, meekly and cheerfully to
submit to fatherly correctives. Aaron
(Lev. x.&nbsp;1&ndash;3), Eli (1&nbsp;Sam. iii.&nbsp;18), the
bereaved mother (2&nbsp;Kings iv.&nbsp;26),
David (Ps. cxix.&nbsp;75).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lessons.</span>&mdash;1.&nbsp;<i>Let us cultivate humility,
watchfulness, and jealously of ourselves</i>
(H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I. 4883, 4901). 2.&nbsp;<i>Let us not
be disconsolate because we are conscious
of weakness and unworthiness.</i> The
errors and failings of the best of men
are left on record, not to extenuate our
sins, but to save us from despair.
They were men of like passions with
ourselves&mdash;the same infirmities and
corruptions&mdash;yet God bore with them,
and saved them out of all their distresses.
Let us therefore &ldquo;hope to
the end,&rdquo; and &ldquo;patiently continue in
well-doing,&rdquo; believing that we shall
be &ldquo;more than conquerors through
Him who hath loved us&rdquo; (H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 class="tdc" id="o341"><span class="smcap">Submission Under God&rsquo;s Rebuke.</span></h3>

<p class="bq">xxxix.&nbsp;8. <i>Then said Hezekiah, &amp;c.</i></p>

<p>I. <span class="smcap">The rebuke.</span></p>

<p>The character of Hezekiah is well
known. One of the very best of the
kings of Judah (2&nbsp;Kings xviii.&nbsp;3&ndash;7).
Nevertheless even in this excellent
man there were moral weaknesses
which were displayed when his physical
malady was removed. The arrival
of the Babylonian ambassadors excited
within him hopes of political advantages
arising from alliance with the
idolatrous king whom they represented,
<span class="pagenum" id="p446">[p.&nbsp;446]</span>
and in order to impress the envoys
with a sense of his importance, he made
an ostentatious display of his wealth
(ver. 2). This displeased the Lord.
Why? 1.&nbsp;Because Hezekiah let slip
a favourable opportunity of making
known to the heathen the glory and
the goodness of the God of
<span class="wsnw">Israel.<a id="o341_fna1" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#o341_fn1">[1]</a></span>
2.&nbsp;Because his ostentation made it
plain that pride was usurping the
throne of his heart (2&nbsp;Chron. xxxii.&nbsp;26).</p>

<p>But this was not the habitual frame
of Hezekiah&rsquo;s mind; he was a good
man, and therefore God lovingly chastened
him. If it had been the wicked
Ahab who had done this deed, the
Lord might possibly have taken no
notice of it; He might have left that
idolatrous sinner to have followed his
own devices. But seeing this evil
spirit begin to show itself in a pious
and humble man, the Lord mercifully
and savingly interposes to check it in
the beginning (vers. 3&ndash;7).</p>

<p>II. <span class="smcap">The manner in which it
was received.</span></p>

<p>Sharp as was the rebuke sent him
by Isaiah, Hezekiah so received it as
to give a rare example of pious and
cheerful resignation (text). Both
parts of his reply are remarkable.
1.&nbsp;<i>&ldquo;Good is the word of the Lord which
thou hast spoken.&rdquo;</i> None but a child
of God could have used this language
in sincerity, under such trying circumstances.
But he has such faith in
God, that although it is impossible for
him to foresee what wickedness his
posterity would commit, he knows
that the decree will be found to be
righteous (1&nbsp;Sam. iii.&nbsp;18). But doubtless
he meant something more than
submission to God&rsquo;s sovereignty; he
meant to acknowledge the goodness
of the Lord to himself, of which this
very rebuke was a new manifestation
(H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I. 190&ndash;196, 162&ndash;165). 2.&nbsp;<i>&ldquo;He
said moreover, For there shall be peace
and truth in my days.&rdquo;</i> That is, God
hath been pleased to inform me that
my children are to be carried into
captivity and to suffer much affliction;
but in my grief for this, I must not
forget to thank Him for His tender
mercies to myself. He has declared
that I shall have peace, and this is far
more than I deserve.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Application.</span>&mdash;1.&nbsp;We may learn
what exceeding sinfulness and immense
danger there often is in sins
which we are apt to pass over as trifles,
and hardly to notice in ourselves (H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I.
4897, 4898, 4516). 2.&nbsp;Remark
an inestimable privilege of the children
of God&rsquo;s love: they may fall into the
very same troubles as their naughty
neighbours, but in the one case calamity
is the angry lash of the law, in the
other it is the faithful rebuke of an
anxious Father. 3.&nbsp;For the history
of God&rsquo;s dealings with Hezekiah we
may infer what must be the wisest
wish for any man to make, viz., that
God would take us into His holy keeping
and choose our inheritance for us.
If we were left to determine for ourselves,
some would choose one thing,
and some another. Yet &ldquo;sorrow is
better than laughter;&rdquo; and the history
of Hezekiah is proof of it (H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I.
211, 3986, 3998&ndash;4001). 4.&nbsp;If sin
have brought rebuke unto you, search
and try your ways, that you may see
what your transgression and weakness
is; and then accept the chastening of
the Lord as a token of His love (H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I.
144&ndash;147). 5.&nbsp;Whatsoever may have
befallen you, remember always that
the mercies which remain are far
greater than you deserve; and that
in the day of prosperity, no less than
in the evil, there is need for perseverance
and watchfulness (H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I.
4888&ndash;4890).&mdash;<i>Archdeacon Bather: Sermons

If, instead of showing them his treasures,
he had related to these idolatrous Chaldeans,
who were worshippers of the sun, the account
of his marvellous cure, and especially the
miracle by which the shadow was made to go
ten degrees backward on the dial, he might
have been the means of bringing them to the
knowledge of the true God who made the
heavens, and of convincing them that He
was master even of that glorious luminary,
which they ignorantly adored instead of its
Creator.&mdash;<i>Bather.</i></p></div>

<p class="bq">i.&nbsp;3. <i>The ox knoweth his owner, &amp;c.</i></p>

<p>&ldquo;We are wise.&rdquo; So spake the
Greek of old in the pride of his intellectual
powers, and so speak many
in our own day who have imbibed
the spirit of the Greek. Reason is a
wonderful faculty, and there have not
been wanting, in any age of the world,
those who have felt elated by their
successful exercise of it. It can look
before and after, deriving experience
from the past and suggestions provision
against the future. It can explore
the hidden secrets of Nature
and render the world of matter subservient
to man; it can turn in upon
itself and speculate upon its own processes;
nay, it can teach us something
of the existence and attributes of the
Most High. Such being the triumphs
of reason, it can hardly be matter of
wonder that the wise men of this
world plume themselves on the attainment
of those triumphs.</p>

<p>The vainglorying of men, however,
whatever form it may assume, is
abomination in the sight of God. In
the scheme of salvation which God
has devised there is no room for boasting
either of our moral or intellectual
endowments: &ldquo;It is excluded.&rdquo; That
scheme is essentially humbling in its
character; it is so constructed as to
shut out pride at every cranny where
it could possibly insinuate itself; it is
such as to stop every mouth and bring
in all the world guilty before God.
And not only guilty, but blind also.
He will have all the world convicted
in the court of Conscience of folly, no
less than of sin. In order to bring
His people to this conviction, he expostulates
with them in many passages
of His Word on the vainglorious
boasts they were in the habit of uttering,
shows them their utter emptiness, and
exhibits the inconsistency of man&rsquo;s
moral conduct with his pretensions to
wisdom and enlightenment (cf. Jer.
viii.&nbsp;7, 8).</p>

<p>Our text implies two things&mdash;1.&nbsp;That
the religion subsisting between
the brute creation and man is in some
measure similar to that which subsists
between man and God; and, 2.&nbsp;That
the acknowledgement made by dumb
animals of their relation to mankind
strangely contrasts with the natural
man&rsquo;s refusal of acknowledgement to
God.</p>

<p><b>I. We are to compare the relations
subsisting between an inferior and a
superior creature with those subsisting
between a superior and the Creator.</b>
Note, though these relations
may be susceptible of comparison, and
may be used to lift up our minds to
apprehension of the truth, there is an
insufficiency in the lower relation to
type out the higher. The distance
between man and the inferior creatures,
if great, is measurable; whereas
the distance between finite man and
the Infinite God is incalculable.</p>

<p>The dumb creature recognises the
master whose property it is: &ldquo;The
ox knoweth his owner.&rdquo; What constitutes
man&rsquo;s right of ownership in
the ox? Simply the fact that he
bought it. He did not create it. If
he supports its life, it is only by providing
it with a due supply of food,
not by ministering to it momentarily
the breath which it draws, nor by
regulating the springs of its animal
economy. That is the sum of his
ownership. <i>But what constitutes God&rsquo;s
right of ownership in us, His intelligent
and rational creatures?</i></p>

<p>1. We are the work of His hands.
Creation constitutes a property in all
<span class="pagenum" id="p448">[p.&nbsp;448]</span>
our faculties and a claim to our services
which no creature hath or can
have in another.</p>

<p>2. Our property is most entire, our
claim of right most indisputable, in
those things which, having been once
deprived of them by fraud or violence,
we have subsequently paid a price to
recover. The flocks and herds in the
possession of civilised European settlers
in uncivilised countries are often swept
away by a barbarous horde of native
freebooters. Imagine, then, a case in
which, it being impossible to bring the
offenders by justice (by reason of their
numbers and strength), the owners of
the cattle should effect a ransom of
their property by laying down a sum
equivalent to its value. Is it not
thenceforth theirs by a double claim&mdash;the
claim of original ownership and
the claim of subsequent ransom? Such
is the claim which God has over us.
That claim, grounded originally upon
the fact of creation, has been confirmed,
enlarged, extended a thousand-fold
by the fact of redemption (1&nbsp;Cor.
vi.&nbsp;20; 1&nbsp;Pet. i.&nbsp;18, 19).</p>

<p>3. Our text suggests another detail
of the claims which our Heavenly
Owner has upon our allegiance: &ldquo;The
ass knoweth his master&rsquo;s crib.&rdquo; He
knows the manger at which he is fed
and the hand that feeds him. Here
is a palpable claim upon regard, although
by no means so high as those
previously advanced. It is a claim
appreciable by the senses, capable of
being understood and responded to by
the mere animal nature. In palliation
of man&rsquo;s neglect of those claims of God
which are established by creation and
redemption, it might haply be pleaded
that he is a creature of the senses, and
that the facts of creation and redemption
are not cognisable by them. These
stupendous facts are transacted and
past. But even this paltry justification
is entirely cut off by the fact here
implied, that man is indebted to God
for his daily maintenance, for the comfort
and the convenience even of his
animal <span class="wsnw">life.<a id="o342_fna1" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#o342_fn1">[1]</a></span></p>

<p>Observe, also, that it is not the brute
creation <i>in a savage state</i> whose relations
towards men are here drawn into
comparison with the relations of man
towards God. To illustrate his argument
the inspired writer has chosen
instances from the domestic animals,
who share man&rsquo;s daily toils, live as his
dependants, and are familiarised by
long habit with their master&rsquo;s abode
and ways of life. In drawing out the
contrast, he does not mention mankind
generally, but &ldquo;<i>Israel</i> doth not
know, <i>my people</i> doth not consider.&rdquo;
It were in some measure excusable
that the heathens should refuse acknowledgement
to the living God,
whom they know not. But what
shall we urge in extenuation of the
indifference of &ldquo;Israel,&rdquo; who from his
very infancy has been of the household
of God, domesticated by the
hearth of the Universal Parent, and
furnished with every means of access
to His presence?</p>

<p><b>II. A contrast is drawn between
the acknowledgement made by dumb
animals of their relation to their
owners and Israel&rsquo;s refusal of acknowledgment
to his God.</b></p>

<p>The cattle &ldquo;know&rdquo; or recognise
the voice of their owner; his call
they heed, in his steps they follow;
irrational creatures though they be,
they are not insensible to their benefactor&rsquo;s
fond cares. What a cutting
reproof of the insensibility of God&rsquo;s
people!</p>

<p>1. They recognise not God in His
warnings, whether they be addressed
to them as individuals or to the nation
of which they are members. Afflictions
arrest them not in their career
of vanity and sin. Judgments stir
them not out of their lethargy of indifference.
They hear not, see not,
God in them.</p>

<p>2. They do not acknowledge God
in His mercies. God&rsquo;s blessings of
Nature and Providence are accepted
by them as a matter of course. If
regarded at all, they are traced no
higher than to secondary causes. The
continual experience of them renders
them not one whit more submissive
to the yoke of God&rsquo;s service. As to
the higher blessings of forgiveness and
<span class="pagenum" id="p449">[p.&nbsp;449]</span>
grace, they feel no need of them, and
evince no gratitude for them.</p>

<p>Want of consideration is the root
and reason of this strange insensibility.
It is not that &ldquo;Israel&rdquo; lacks
the faculty of apprehending God, but
he will not be at pains to exercise
that faculty. It is not that he lacks
a speculative knowledge of the truths
now set forth, but that he does not
lay to heart this knowledge, nor allow
it its due weight.&mdash;<i>E.&nbsp;M. Goulburn,
D.C.L.: Sermons,</i> pp. 153&ndash;181.</p>

<div class="footnotes"><h4 class="tdc">FOOTNOTES:</h4>
<div class="footnote" id="o342_fn1"><p><a href="#o342_fna1"><span class="label">[1]</span></a>
Of this fact a strongly figurative but
very beautiful statement is contained in a
passage of Hosea&mdash;a passage remarkably illustrative
of that before us, inasmuch as there
also the imagery is drawn from man&rsquo;s dealings
with the cattle. &ldquo;I drew them,&rdquo; says God,
&ldquo;with the cords of a man, with bonds of love:
and I was to them as they that take off the
yoke on their jaws, and I laid meat unto
them.&rdquo; <i>&ldquo;I was to them as they that take off
the yoke on their jaws.&rdquo;</i> The owner of the
ox does not overtask his strength, does not
cause him to toil in the furrow without intermission.
At the approach of evening the
faithful animal is driven homewards, and
freed from the shackles of the galling and
burdensome yoke. An image this of God&rsquo;s
dealing with His human children. Our every
period of refreshment and repose, of ease and
relaxation from toil, is from the unseen hand
of our heavenly Owner. Those many fractions
of comfort and happiness which lighten
the load of life&mdash;those numerous (although
momentary) glimpses of sunshine which relieve
the plodding routine of our daily career&mdash;those
flowers with which the path of the great
majority is more or less strewed: the innocent
sally of mirth, the smile of affection, the expression
of sympathy, the cheering word of
encouragement from those whose encouragement
is justly valued&mdash;these, like all other
mercies, are from God, and (though these be
but a small part of what we have to be thankful
for) are designed to draw us towards Him
in bonds of gratitude and love.</p>

<p><i>&ldquo;And I laid meat unto them.&rdquo;</i> By those
who avail themselves of their services, the
cattle are supplied with provender. God not
only called us into being, but maintains us in
being. He it is who gives us our daily bread,
and spreads our board with food convenient
for us; for food, for health, for continuance
of life our dependence upon Him is absolute.
By means of these and similar mercies it is
that God establishes a claim to the gratitude
and devotedness even of those among His
rational creatures who have most deeply buried
themselves in the things of time and sense,
and whose hearts seem to be stirred by no
breath of spiritual aspiration, and troubled by
no prospect of eternity.&mdash;<i>Goulburn.</i></p></div>

<p class="bq">ii.&nbsp;4. <i>They shall beat their swords into ploughshares, and their spears into pruning-hooks;
nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall they learn war
any more.</i></p>

<p>A prediction of times yet to come.
It is never yet been fulfilled. It is
true that when the religion of Christ
came to the world it came with the
spirit and principles of an all-pacific
dispensation (<i>&ldquo;On earth peace, goodwill
towards men&rdquo;</i>); and true that, in
the degree of its actual prevalence,
this has been the effect. But how far
is this from anything adequate to the
terms of the prediction, which exhibit
a bright and ample idea of this spirit
and tendency of Christianity realised,
reduced to fact, on the great scale!</p>

<p><b>I. War has been a prominent character
of all ages.</b></p>

<p>1. Man, when he came fresh from
his Creator&rsquo;s hands, must have had in
his soul the principle of all kind affections
(Gen. i.&nbsp;27), a state of feeling
that would have been struck with
horror at the thought of inflicting
suffering. Yet in the first family of
man war and slaughter began. Men
may argue and quibble against our
notion of <i>&ldquo;the fall,&rdquo;</i> but here was fall
enough! and demonstration enough!</p>

<p>2. War prevailed among the antediluvians
(Gen. vi.&nbsp;5, 12). We are
told of some that &ldquo;became mighty
men, men of renown.&rdquo; How? Partly
perhaps in a war against savage beasts,
but far more in the exploits of that
&ldquo;violence&rdquo; which filled the earth, and
doomed it to be overwhelmed.</p>

<p>3. War prevailed among the race
descended from Noah. It was by the
descendants of the only faithful friend
and servant of the Almighty found on
earth that the desolated world was to
be repeopled, and we might have hoped
for a better race, if human nature
<span class="pagenum" id="p450">[p.&nbsp;450]</span>
were intrinsically good, or corrigible
by the most awful dispensations. But
the Flood could not cleanse the nature
of man, nor the awful memory of it
repress the coming forth of selfishness,
pride, ambition, anger, and revenge.
(1.)&nbsp;The history of the Jews is to a
large extent a history of wars.
(2.)&nbsp;The history of the other races is a
history of their conflicts with each
other, of a terrible process by which
the smaller states were absorbed in
others, until they were all included
in the Roman empire. How many
millions of human beings were destroyed
in the process! (3.)&nbsp;Since
that period the history of the world
has been to a large extent written in
<span class="wsnw">blood.<a id="o343_fna1" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#o343_fn1">[1]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Reflections:</i>&mdash;1.&nbsp;What a state of the
spirit of mankind is here disclosed to
us! 2.&nbsp;What a state of Christianity,
or to any real prevalence of it, among
the nations denominated Christian!
3.&nbsp;How necessary that all religious
persons, especially tutors and parents,
should set themselves systematically,
as opportunities offer, to counterwork
that maddening enchantment of the
&ldquo;glory&rdquo; of war; of war considered
merely as the field of great exploits.
Let them strive to break up, in the
view of young and ardent minds, this
splendid, pestilent delusion about
heroes, conquests, fame, and glory.</p>

<p><b>II. War is not necessarily sinful,
nor are those engaged in it to be
always condemned.</b> Defensive war
does not violate Christian principles.
Nay, it is sometimes a
<span class="wsnw">duty.<a id="o343_fna2" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#o343_fn2">[2]</a></span> An
opposite opinion is held by some who
rest on the literal and extreme construction
of a few expressions, such
as &ldquo;Resist not evil,&rdquo; &ldquo;Give place to
wrath,&rdquo; &ldquo;Love your enemies,&rdquo; &ldquo;To
him that smiteth thee on one cheek,
turn also the other.&rdquo; These interdict
revenge. But their unqualified literal
interpretation requires that Christianity
should subject mankind universally
to the unrestrained will of
whoever is the most unjust and
wicked; should teach that so long as
there are men who have more of
Satan and Moloch in them than the
rest, and are intent on practicing
oppression and cruelty, it is the absolute
duty of Christians, as such,
individually and nationally, to let
them do it,&mdash;at least rather than resist
them in such a way as to endanger
their persons. This would be a
delightful doctrine to all the tyrants,
bigots, slave-drivers, robbers, and
murderers! But the magistrate is
not <i>so</i> to leave the matter to God&rsquo;s
disposal, or to refrain from using the
&ldquo;sword&rdquo; against the doers of evil.
And the government of a nation is
but a magistracy on a large scale.</p>

<p>But those principles upon which
a Christian casuist would justify war,
under certain possible circumstance,
would not justify perhaps one in twenty
of the wars that have been waged.
Very rare has been the instance of a
war, on either side, strictly and purely
defensive, of either the nation itself
or any other endangered or oppressed
people depending on its protection.
Hence&mdash;</p>

<p><b>III. We rejoice over this prediction
that war is to cease on the earth.</b></p>

<p>1. This prediction spreads a visionary
sense before us so new, strange,
and delightful, that nothing but prophecy,
and faith in the Divine power
and goodness, could enable us to expect
its <span class="wsnw">realisation.<a id="o343_fna3" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#o343_fn3">[3]</a></span></p>

<p>2. It is difficult to conceive the
practicability of its attainment. For it
is something intrinsic in the soul and
nature of man, throughout the whole
race, that war has sprung from. <i>There</i>
is the hot and terrible element that
has burst abroad in so many thunders.
And yet is it <i>man</i> that is to be universally
at peace! How can it be? (2&nbsp;Kings
vii.&nbsp;2). Vicious selfishness,
ambition, envy, rivalry, rapacity, revenge,
these are the things in men
that cause wars between them, on the
small scale and the great. How can
these ever be so repressed, subdued,
extirpated, that all war shall cease?</p>

<p>3. Certainly not by experience,
philosophy, or <span class="wsnw">civilisation.<a id="o343_fna4" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#o343_fn4">[4]</a></span></p>

<p>4. Nothing will operate efficaciously
to this grand effect that does not go
deep into the constitution of men&rsquo;s
<span class="pagenum" id="p451">[p.&nbsp;451]</span>
souls, and quell internally those fatal
passions which have perpetuated external
war. And that is what cannot
be done by any civilisation, national
refinement, science, or even an enlightened
theoretical policy. All these
may be but like fair structures and
gardens extended over a ground where
volcanic fires are in a temporary slumber
below. All these may be shattered
and exploded by some mighty impulse
of ambition or some blast of revengeful
anger. No; there must be a greater,
nobler power brought into prevalence
among mankind. Nothing springing
merely from the action of the human
mind can suffice. It must be something
coming from heaven. <span class="smcap">Christianity</span>
is the appointed and qualified agent.</p>

<p><b>IV. It is credible that Christianity
will cause wars to cease upon the
earth.</b></p>

<p>1. It has accomplished something in
this direction already. To <i>it</i> is mainly
attributable the mitigation of ferocity
and exterminatory rage, so evident in
modern wars. We dare not assert
even that it may not have prevented
some wars.</p>

<p>2. It is essentially a peacemaker.
Look at its genuine tendency, as displayed
on the smaller scale, in a family,
a neighbourhood, a district: a family
in a constant state of hostility within
itself, but at length the members of it
are converted by the religion of Jesus
Christ. The consequence how happy!
(H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I. 1126.)</p>

<p>3. Precisely as it progresses among
any people it will produce a distaste
for <span class="wsnw">war.<a id="o343_fna5" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#o343_fn5">[5]</a></span></p>

<p>4. Consequently its progress among
the nations is a progressive abolition
of war. Every extension of this
blessed religion is so much gained
against war; quenching still another
and another spark of infernal fire; repressing
in some more minds those
evil passions which are the prompters
and the essential power of war.</p>

<p>5. Christianity <i>is</i> progressing among
the nations.</p>

<p>6. Consequently it is reasonable to
cherish the hope of a scene of universal
peace (P.&nbsp;D. 2675).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Concluding Reflections.</span>&mdash;1.&nbsp;The
universal cessation of war means much
more than merely the cessation of
much mischief. Think what will be
effected when the wealth, time, labour,
art, ingenuity, of truly Christian nations
are directed to the noblest purposes
of peace! 2.&nbsp;Extirpate the war-spirit
from your own breast. The
selfish, proud, arrogant, envious, revengeful,
are essentially of the <i>war
tribe,</i> however, little they have to do
with actual war, however much they
may condemn and profess to deplore
it. Such individuals are not fit for
that future terrestrial &ldquo;kingdom of
heaven.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>John Foster: Lectures, Second
Series,</i> pp. 142&ndash;173.</p>

<div class="footnote" id="o343_fn1"><p><a href="#o343_fna1"><span class="label">[1]</span></a>
What a vision of destruction! Think
of all that tormented and desolated the earth
during the long period of the fall of the
Roman Empire,&mdash;of that inundation of revenge
and death, the progress and utmost extension
of the Mahomedan power; of the
mighty account of slaughter in the Spanish
conquest of America; of the almost incessant
wars among the states of civilised Europe
down nearly to the present hour. Think even
of the bloody wars within our own island,
especially on the border between its northern
and southern divisions; the hundreds of remaining
fortresses, monumental of war. And
to complete the account&mdash;as if the whole solid
earth were not wide enough&mdash;the sea has been
coloured with blood, and received into its dark
gulf myriads of the slain, as if it could not
destroy enough by its tempests and wrecks!&mdash;<i>Foster.</i></p></div>

<div class="footnote" id="o343_fn2"><p><a href="#o343_fna2"><span class="label">[2]</span></a>
Almost four or five years since, our
Government had a war with the Pindarees&mdash;a
terrible assemblage of outlaws, robbers, and
murderers, to the number of fifty thousand,
occupying a strong and almost inaccessible
tract on the northern frontier. Thence with
impetuous rapidity, they rushed down, all
horsemen, on the country, inhabited by a
population of cultivators; seized whatever could
easily be carried off, and with furious eagerness
demolished, burnt, destroyed the rest.
But far more than this, they were universally
possessed with the spirit of murder; they
killed the people without regard to sex or
age. Not only so, but when sufficiently at
leisure for such amusement, they inflicted excruciating
tortures previous to death.</p>

<p>Now, when the Governor-General had intelligence
of this&mdash;<i>what was he to do? what,</i> acting
as a Christian? <i>Nothing?</i> What,
as a great magistrate, did he &ldquo;bear the sword&rdquo;
for? What was he Governor at all for? To
lie in splendid state, and number and tax
the people? Or was he to direct that prayer
should be made in the churches for something
<span class="pagenum" id="p452">[p.&nbsp;452]</span>
very like a miracle? And on failure of that,
prayers that the wretched people he governed
might be all meekly resigned to their fate?
and that even should the fell and fiendish
legion, being unresisted, choose to pursue their
way all down to Calcutta, all the people in
their tract could not escape, and at last
himself and the people of the city, might be
enabled calmly to submit to a sovereign dispensation
of Providence?</p>

<p>He did not do this. He chose rather to
set out on the rule of his appointment, to be &ldquo;a
terror to evil-doers,&rdquo; &ldquo;a minister of God, a
revenger, to execute wrath upon them that do
evil&rdquo; (Rom. xiii.&nbsp;4). But if war is in all
possible cases wrong, he perpetuated an enormous
crime against Christianity in marching
his armies with a celerity unparalleled in that
climate, and encountering, intercepting, and
exterminating the murderers, so that the surviving
people could feel themselves in peace.</p>

<hr />

<p>Put the stronger case of an immense host
of northern barbarians being landed on our
coasts (Tartars, Cossacks, Calmucks), and
joined there by the legions of the Popish
states, what would happen if we all, as Christians,
judged it wrong and wicked to fight?
Unless, indeed, we should suppose a divided
opinion in the nation with respect to the
Christian principle of the case, and that so a
very large and powerful proportion was resolute
to resist in all the array and action of
war. Now, while with the utmost sacrifice
and peril they were doing so, and suppose
successfully, what a remarkable phenomenon
would be presented! namely, the other division
of the people deploring these very proceedings
and successes by which their houses
are saved from ravage and desolation,&mdash;deploring
them as an awful outrage against
Christian rectitude,&mdash;praying for the instant
<i>conversion</i> of these deluded men to a right
apprehension of Christian duty,&mdash;that they
might immediately throw away their arms
and allow the barbarian inundation to burst
forward! Or, having failed in this prayer
(and a mighty victory having finally cleared
the land of the infernal irruption), then
lamenting that a dreadful national violation
of Christian principles had been irretrievably
consummated! And as success purchased by
crime can in the result be little else than a
calamity and a judgment, they might be
alarmed and dismayed to find themselves still
in possession of their former freedom of worship,
of speech, of action, and of all
their rights as citizens.&mdash;<i>Foster.</i> (Written in
1823.)</p></div>

<div class="footnote" id="o343_fn3"><p><a href="#o343_fna3"><span class="label">[3]</span></a>
It is difficult to realise the fact to our
imagination. No fighting on the face of the
whole earth! no armies, no military profession,
no garrisons, nor arms, nor banners,
nor proclamations! No leagues, offensive or
defensive; no guarding of frontiers; no fortresses;
no military prisons! No celebrating
of victories in gaudy pomps and revelries for
the vulgar, or in prostituted poetry for the
more refined! A wondering what kind of
times those could be in which mankind accounted
it the highest glory to kill one
another! Truly this is a state of things we
are ill prepared even to conceive!&mdash;<i>Foster.</i></p></div>

<div class="footnote" id="o343_fn4"><p><a href="#o343_fna4"><span class="label">[4]</span></a>
Such things will be <i>included,</i> certainly,
in whatever process can and shall reduce the
world at length to peace; they will be taken
as accessories and subsidiaries to the Master
Power in operation. But whoever would
reckon on such things alone should be
strangely mortified, one thinks, in adverting
to many facts of old and recent history.
What, for example, is he to do with the history
of Greece? or of the Italian Republics?
Or nearer home, Britain and France account
themselves the most enlightened and civilised
states in the world; they have not been, with
all their might, fighting and slaying each
other and neighbouring nations for centuries,
almost without intermission, down to this
time! In the French revolutionary government,
which, after a time, became essentially
warlike, there were more philosophers, speculative,
literary men, than ever in any other.
In our own country, through the last half-century,
the enlightened and civilised people
(often so described and lauded at least)
have needed but a little excitement, at
any time, to rush out into war. Our institutions
of learning, and even theology, have
constantly abetted the spirit. An ever-flowing,
impetuous stream there has been of oratory,
poetry, and even pulpit declamation,
mingling with and inspiriting the coarse torrent
of the popular zeal for battles and victories.
We have had both poets and divines
actually sending the most immoral heroes to
heaven, on the mere strength of their falling
in patriotic combat. All this tells but ill for
the efficacy of civilisation, literature, refinement,
and the instruction of experience to
promote the spirit of peace, without the predominance
of some mightier cause.&mdash;<i>Foster.</i></p></div>

What will the natural consequences be
in respect to war? Will it not be coldness
towards that pernicious phantasm, martial
&ldquo;glory&rdquo;;&mdash;a loathing of that sort of eloquence
and poetry that are making a god of it;&mdash;a
hatred of the very name of ambitious conquerors;&mdash;horror
at the image of vast masses
of men waiting to destroy one another;&mdash;a
sense of the flagrant absurdity, as well
as iniquity, of the avenging some little wrong
at the cost of so mighty a portion and
variety of misery;&mdash;and a faith that Providence
has not so abandoned the world that we
are not to wait one moment for any interposition
from it in favour of justice, but, the
instant the scales of justice are poised, we
must throw in the sword? Such would be the
spirit and temper of a nation predominantly
Christian.&mdash;<i>Foster.</i></p></div>

<h3 class="tdc" id="o344"><span class="smcap">God Exalted in the Great Day.</span></h3>

<p class="tdc">(<i>Advent Sermon.</i>)</p>

<p class="bq">ii.&nbsp;17. <i>The Lord alone shall be exalted in that day.</i></p>

<p>Two questions: What is &ldquo;that
day?&rdquo; How shall the Lord then be
exalted?</p>

<p>I. <i>&ldquo;That day.&rdquo;</i> &ldquo;The first five verses
of this chapter foretell the kingdom of
the Messiah, the conversion of the
Gentiles, and their admission into the
Church. From the sixth verse to the
end is foretold the punishment of the
unbelieving Jews for their idolatrous
practices, their confidence in their own
strength, and distrust of God&rsquo;s protection;
and, moreover, the destruction
of idolatry in consequence of the establishment
of Messiah&rsquo;s kingdom.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Lowth.</i>
But here, as in many other
portions of Scripture, a larger and remoter
meaning looms beyond and behind
the first sense of the expressions,
which would otherwise be too big and
swelling for the actual interpretation
of them. Compare the description
in which the text twice occurs with
the almost parallel passages in chap.
v.&nbsp;14&ndash;16. How magnificent! What
startling terms! What emphatic iterations!
Surely a want of fitness and
congruity would almost be felt if expressions
such as these referred <i>only</i>
to some temporal calamity of the Jewish
nation; surely we cannot mistake in
looking onward to some mightier catastrophe,
to some final exaltation of
God and abasement of all creatures.
By &ldquo;<i>that</i> day,&rdquo; therefore, we mean
what is elsewhere called &ldquo;<i>the</i> day,&rdquo;
&ldquo;the great day,&rdquo; &ldquo;the day of judgment,&rdquo;
&ldquo;the great and terrible day of
the Lord&rdquo;&mdash;the consummation of all
things.</p>

<p>When that day shall come I do not
know, and I am content to remain in
ignorance. It may come suddenly,
without warning, unannounced. Then
it is for men always to have their
lamps burning and their hearts in
readiness, lest they be taken by surprise.
It may come with great signs
preceding and accompanying it. Then
it is for men, according to their capacity,
to note and discern those signs.
It is the very uncertainty connected
with it that is to make us watchful
(Matt. xxiv.&nbsp;36, 42). We are to be
vigilant and observant, without pretending
to determine what God has
left unrevealed. Such attempts have
in all ages been made, and in all ages
have been falsified. The failure of
those attempts has not only covered
those who made them or believed in
them with ridicule, it has brought
into discredit the sacred Book which
the aim was to expound. It is our first
duty and highest interest to be at
every moment prepared; but a far
other and better preparation may, and
must be made for it, than in the futile
endeavour to discover its precise
<span class="wsnw">date.<a id="o344_fna1" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#o344_fn1">[1]</a></span></p>

<p>Equally unwise is the disposition to
specify with a minute particularity the
events which are to usher in the great
day of the Lord, or the convulsions of
nature which shall herald and proclaim
it, or the astonishing circumstances
with which it shall be arrayed. God
has chosen to involve them in a mysterious
and solemn indistinctness. In
bold and sublime figures the inspired
writers have delineated a scene which
must stand singular and by itself, without
any precedent or parallel, and
which, therefore, neither human language
can directly express nor human
understanding adequately comprehend.
Instead of endeavouring to explain the
images and symbols employed, prudence
will lead us to confine ourselves
to the very words of Scripture, such as
Dan. xii.&nbsp;2; Joel iii.&nbsp;11&ndash;15; 2&nbsp;Cor. v.&nbsp;10;
Matt. xxv.&nbsp;31, 32; Rev. xx.&nbsp;11&ndash;13;
1&nbsp;Cor. <span class="wsnw">xv. 51&ndash;53.<a id="o344_fna2" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#o344_fn2">[2]</a></span>
On these declarations
we should meditate with
serious and chastened minds, for if
Scripture be true these words cannot
be without a real and solemn meaning,
and that meaning can only be that
<span class="pagenum" id="p454">[p.&nbsp;454]</span>
there shall be a day in which the world
shall be judged by God in Christ, and
that from before the Divine tribunal
the good and the evil, separated from
each other, shall depart to destinies
final and irreversible (P.&nbsp;D. 2109).</p>

<p>II. <i>In that day the Lord alone shall
be exalted.</i></p>

<p>1. How is this possible? Is not
God always exalted far above all blessing
and praise? He will then be exalted
in the sense in which He is now
said to be glorified. He will be exalted
in the visible homage and submission
of an assembled universe. He will be
exalted by the full manifestation of
His attributes, in their unclouded and
effulgent lustre, but the exhibition,
before men and angels, of His omnipotence
and justice, His wisdom and
truth, His love and mercy, of the holiness
of His law, the equity of His
administration, the abundance of His
grace, so that all hearts shall be bowed
down at His footstool, and every mouth
shall be stopped.</p>

<p>2. In that day God shall be exalted
<i>alone.</i></p>

<p>(1) The text may lead our minds to
other deities as opposed to Jehovah.
They shall indeed be gone; in that
day they shall be seen to be less than
the least of all their worshippers.</p>

<p>(2) It will be the great day of the
disclosure of all things; and all creatures
shall see the Lord as He is, and
themselves also as they are. Therefore
shall all the highest orders of
celestial intelligences, the cherubim
and seraphim, and all the ranks of
existence which may occupy the interval
between man and His Maker,
veil their faces before His throne;
they shall be as nothing in <i>His</i> sight.
Then shall all creatureship fall low
before the one Creator; all derived,
dependent being shall shrink into its
true dimensions before the Absolute,
the Eternal, the I AM.</p>

<p>(3) Even Christ Himself, His office as
the Messiah having been accomplished,
and His administration of the Church,
in His human character, being brought
to a close, shall resign His mediatorial
sway (1&nbsp;Cor. xv.&nbsp;24&ndash;28; H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I. 985).</p>

<p>(4) But our chief concern, as we are
men, is with humanity: &ldquo;The lofty
looks of <i>man</i> shall be humbled, and
the haughtiness of <i>man</i> shall be bowed
down; and the Lord alone shall be
exalted in that day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>That day shall indeed declare the
impotence of human power, the emptiness
of human ambition, the nothingness
of human <span class="wsnw">renown.<a id="o344_fna3" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#o344_fn3">[3]</a></span> The very
circumstances on account of which men
have most lifted themselves up in their
lifetime will be the occasions of their
profoundest humiliation then.</p>

<p>In that day our sinfulness shall sink
us into the dust, and cover us with
shame and confusion even more than
our vanities. Shall any one of us
hope then to be exalted, when the
memories of us all shall retrace so
many sterile and unproductive intensions,
so many good impressions never
fostered and ripened into fruits of
righteousness, so many talents misused
by our iniquity, or buried by our
idleness? Then there shall be no
more concealments, no more deceits,
no more false excuses, no more of
those pretences, equivocations, subterfuges,
and sophisms which our reason
is now so fatally ingenious in playing
off upon itself (P.&nbsp;D. 661, 2106). Oh,
think of these things, and let not your
sins be dearer to you than your salvation.
Think of them ere the night
cometh, and the sun of your probation
has quite gone down.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Lord <i>alone</i> shall be exalted
in that day.&rdquo; Will He then confound
the righteous with the wicked? As
compared with God there shall be no
distinctions between men. All men
on that great day at the bar of the
Omniscient and the All Holy shall
have upon them a universal sense
of imperfection, unworthiness, insufficiency,
nothingness. But as compared
with each other there will be immense
differences between them. It is one
purpose of the great day to make
manifest to all orders of being the
infinite value and superiority of moral
goodness, the infinite preciousness of
a holy obedience above and beyond all
else; then God, who sees it in secret,
<span class="pagenum" id="p455">[p.&nbsp;455]</span>
will reward it openly. When the
wicked shall be turned into hell, with
all the people that forget God, the
righteous shall shine forth as the stars
of heaven. Therefore estimate all
things <i>now</i> as you will estimate them
then. Lean less upon earth and man
and the things present, set your affections
more upon the things to come,
upon heaven, and upon the Ruler of
heaven. Cultivate diligently those
dispositions which are pleasing in His
sight. For then, when all social
forms shall have vanished away, when
all material substances shall have been
obliterated, as the shapes in a cloud,
and dissipated as the morning dew,
your moral temper will abide with
you, and your spiritual state, as discerned
by the unerring Judge, will
decide, and will attend, your immortal
destiny (H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I. 720).&mdash;<i>James Shergold
Boone, M.A.: Sermons,</i> pp. 359&ndash;399.</p>

During the fifth century Chrysostom
expressed himself in language which sounds
almost like an anticipation of much that we
hear at the present day. &ldquo;No long time now
remains until the consummation; but the
world is hastening to its end. This the wars
declare, this the afflictions, this the love which
hath waxed cold. For as the body, when in
its last gasp and near to death, draws to itself
ten thousand sufferings; and as when a
house is about to fall, many portions are wont
to fall beforehand from the roofs and walls;
so is the end of the world nigh and at the
very doors, and, therefore, ten thousand woes
are everywhere scattered abroad&rdquo; (<i>Homily</i>
xxxiv.) Towards the close of the tenth century,
Bernhard, a hermit of Thuringia, and other
persons, spread or encouraged the belief, that
after the end of the thousandth year, the fetters
of Satan were to be broken; and that, after the
reign of Antichrist should be terminated, the
world would be consumed by sudden conflagration.
This wild and extraordinary delusion
pervaded and possessed every rank of society.
It seized on nobles, princes, and even bishops,
as well as on the common people. Many renounced
their pursuits and professions; abandoned
their friends and families; gave themselves
up to superstitious prayer and terrifying
expectations, and made over all their substance
to some adjacent church or monastery.
Almost all the donations which were made to
the Church in this century proceeded from
this avowed motive, that the end of the world
was drawing near. The form ran, <span lang="la">&ldquo;Appropinquante
jam mundi termino,&rdquo;</span> &amp;c. Others
permitted their lands to lie waste, and their
homes to decay; or betook themselves in
hasty flight to the shelter of rocks and caverns,
as if the temples of nature were destined to
preservation amidst the wreck of man and
his works.&mdash;<i>Boone.</i></p></div>

I forbear to expatiate on the phenomena
or the tokens which shall be the premonitory
of the Millennium or of the day of judgment.
God has not seen fit, even in Scripture,
to withdraw the curtain of obscurity from between
us and that supreme future. We may
well be content that our apprehensions should
be vague, when the language of the Bible is
not definite, and when we find rather the
sublime and half-luminous gloom with which
poetry or painting can invest its delineations,
than the sharp and precise outline which the
chisel can carve.&mdash;<i>Boone.</i></p></div>

<div class="footnote" id="o344_fn3"><p><a href="#o344_fna3"><span class="label">[3]</span></a>
What shall they all be, the strong
rivalries and contentions, which shall have
been hushed in the grave; the towering
structures of vanity and earthly hope, which
shall have been crushed before the moth;
the schemes and plottings, the contrivances
and expectations, the struggles and triumphs,
which shall have been dropped into the
burial-place where the worm is feeding on
them! Oh, the thrones and dominions of
mortality, the crowns and sceptres, the regal
splendours and the imperial sway, how shall
they then be reduced to their real and intrinsic
insignificance! The victories of the
warrior who conquered in a hundred fights,
and the projects of the politician, whose
statesmanship could grasp the globe; the
famous men and heroes of the earth, with
the poets who celebrated them, and the historians
who recounted their exploits, what
shall they be before the word of Omnipotence!
The learning and science of the philosophers
who framed their system of the universe for
the admiration of posterity, what shall they be,
before the blaze of illumination which shall
be poured upon us in another world! The
pageantries of courts and palaces; the banquets
and the wine-cups, the spectacles and
the entertainments, the mirrors and the
lamps, the golden furniture of pomp, and
the flowing robe of luxury; the great and
the affluent, whose patronage was requested
for busy undertakings, who were besieged
with flattery and obsequiousness from morning
to night; the noble and the beautiful,
who gathered homage as they moved; the
writers and the orators, whose popularity was
unbounded, and who lived amidst the incense
of human applause; they, and all that appertained
to them, where and what shall they
be, as we stand poor, and naked, and miserable
before Him with whom we have to do!
They, the heedless and the selfish, swimming
in pleasure, who thought that the whole
voyage of life was to be like Cleopatra&rsquo;s
passage along the Cydnus, one scene of mirth
and gorgeousness; of prodigal dissipation
and fatal revelry, with soft music and delicate
odours floating in the air; what shall become
of <i>them</i>! How black and cold shall be the
cinders of their joy!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="p456">[p.&nbsp;456]</span>
All human dynasties will then have crumbled
to pieces, and all the gradations in the
scale of human rank will then have been
blotted out; for all must be dwarfed and
prostrated before the ineffable majesty of the
Most High God. All other differences must
fade when the Divine summits are placed in
contrast with them; as from the top of an
exceeding high mountain the whole ground
beneath is as a level plain, because from that
vast altitude all smaller elevations are lost,
all minuter inequalities of surface vanish.
Human celebrity will then be as a sound, the
very echoes of which will have departed. The
pompous titles with which the vanity of man
was pampered; the distinctions which kings
could confer, or heraldry emblazon; privileges
of caste, nobility of blood, the pride of
ancestry, the blaze of reputation, the splendour
of talents, shall then be confounded,
one and all, as frivolous toys and trifling
baubles. The mighty ones of the earth shall
be no more than they who were of the poorest
condition; the great shall stand abashed with
the mean, the learned with the ignorant,
monarchs with their subjects, senators and
princes, commanders of fleets and armies, the
loftiest and most renowned by the side of the
husbandman and the labourer; for what shall
they all be in contrast with Him, the Universal
Creator, whose dwelling-place is eternity,
and to whom belong, throughout all ages, all
glory and dominion, sovereignty and praise!&mdash;<i>Boone.</i></p></div>

<h3 class="tdc" id="o345"><span class="smcap">The Inexcusability and Hopelessness of Unbelief.</span></h3>

<p class="bq">v.&nbsp;4. <i>What could have been done more to my vineyard that I have not done in it?</i></p>

<p>In a subsequent verse God condescends
to explain what is here meant
by His &ldquo;vineyard,&rdquo; so that there
might be no doubt as to the scope and
import of the passage (ver. 7). God
has done everything which could be
done for the spiritual culture of His
ancient Church (vers. 3, 4). This assertion
that &ldquo;as much had been done
as could be done&rdquo; is very affecting and
startling. And if this could be said
of the Jewish vineyard, what shall
be said of the Christian?</p>

<p>There is a peculiar argument thus
suggested, which, wrought out, will
show that men are inexcusable in persisting
in their unbelief, since nothing
more could have been done to win
them to the side of righteousness
and to turn them to God. Notice
carefully <i>the variety of the arguments
addressed in Scripture to the thoughtless
and obdurate.</i> At one time they
are attacked with terrors, the picture
being set before them of Divine
wrath; at another they are acted on
by the loving-kindness of God, and
allured by the free mercies of the
Gospel. In the text it is not precisely
either the one or the other of
these methods. There is nothing alleged
but the greatness of what has
been done for us&mdash;a greatness such
that nothing more can be done, consistently,
at least, with that moral
accountableness which must regulate
the amount of influence which God
brings to bear on men. If this be so,
if we are not convinced and renewed
under the existing instrumentality,
there is nothing that can avert from
us utter destruction.</p>

<p>But is this so? Review the means
provided and proffered for our rescue,
and let us see whether any of us can
be other than silent. If we were
arguing with a man who disbelieved
the existence of God, we should probably
reason up from the creation to
the Creator. Our adversary might
challenge us to prove that nothing
short of Infinite Power could have
built and furnished the planet. It
may be allowed that certain results
lie beyond human agency, and yet
disputed whether they need such an
agency as we strictly call Divine. We
do not, therefore, maintain that the
evidences in creation are the strongest
which can be conceived. Hence we
should not perhaps feel warranted in
saying to the atheist, &ldquo;What more
could have been done to produce
belief in you if you resist all these
tokens of God in Nature?&rdquo; But if we
cannot say to the atheist, when pointing
to the surrounding creation,
&ldquo;What more could have been done
that has not been done for your conviction?&rdquo;
we can ply the worldly-minded
with this question when pointing to
the scheme of salvation through Christ.
We deny that the worldly-minded can
appeal from what God has done on
<span class="pagenum" id="p457">[p.&nbsp;457]</span>
their behalf to a yet mightier interference
which imagination can picture.
It is the property of redemption, if
not of creation, that it leaves no room
for imagination. Those who turn
with indifference from the proffers of
the Gospel are just in the position of
the atheist who should remain such
after God had set before him the highest
possible demonstration of Himself.
It is not, we think, too bold a thing
to say that, in redeeming us, God exhausted
Himself&mdash;<i>He gave Himself.</i>
And we may not argue that, resisting
what has been granted, you demonstrate
that you cannot be overcome,
and thus your condemnation is sealed
by the incontrovertible truth involved
in the question of the text?</p>

<p>Looked at more in detail, the argument
is&mdash;<b>I.&nbsp;As much has been done as
could have been done, because of the
Agency through which man&rsquo;s redemption
was effected.</b> In looking at the
cross, considering our sins as laid on
the Being who hangs there in weakness
and ignominy, the overcoming thought
is, that this Being is none other than
the Everlasting God, and that however
He seem mastered by the powers
of wickedness, He could by a single
word, uttered from the altar on which
He immolates Himself, scatter the
universe into nothing, and call up an
assemblage of new worlds and new
creatures.&mdash;<i>What a condemning force
this throws into the question of the text!</i>
If it give an unmeasured stupendousness
to the work of our redemption,
that He who undertook, carried on,
and completed that work was &ldquo;the
brightness of the Father&rsquo;s glory and
the express image of His person,&rdquo;
then surely what has been done for
the &ldquo;vineyard&rdquo; proclaims us ruined
if we bring not forth such fruits as
God requires at our hands.&mdash;<i>If the
extent of what has been done may be
given in evidence that if it prove ineffectual
there remains nothing more to be
tried, what say you to the justice of the
question? what to the condemnation under
which it leaves the worldly-minded and
rebellious?</i></p>

<p><b>II. As much has been done as could
have been done, regard being had to
the completeness and fulness of the
work, as well as to the greatness of
its Author.</b> We might have been
sure beforehand that what the Divine
Agent undertook would be thoroughly
effected. The sins of the whole race
were laid on Christ. There is consequently
nothing in our own guiltiness
to make us hesitate as to the
possibility of <i>forgiveness.</i> The penalties
of a violated law have been
actually discharged.</p>

<p>The scheme of redemption provides
also for our <i>acceptance,</i> so that happiness
may be obtained. If it met our
necessities only in part, there might be
excuse for refusing it our attention.
When you add to the unsearchable
riches of grace in Christ <i>the continued
and earnest agency of the Holy Spirit,</i>
have you a word to plead against the
remonstrance of God in the text?</p>

<p><b>III. We are bound to regard the
Gospel of Jesus Christ as the grand
revelation of future punishment and
reward.</b> Until the Redeemer appeared
and brought more direct
tidings from the invisible world, the
sanctions of eternity were scarcely, if
at all, brought to bear on the occupations
of time. So imperfect had
been the foregoing knowledge regarding
the immortality of the soul that
Paul declared of Christ that He &ldquo;abolished
death, and brought life and
immortality to light by the Gospel.&rdquo;
Much of what has been done for the
&ldquo;vineyard&rdquo; consists in the greatness of
the reward which the Gospel promises
to righteousness, and the greatness of
the punishment which it denounces on
impenitence.</p>

<p>It was not redemption from mere
temporary evil that Christ effected.
Redemption does not make men immortal,
but, finding them so, it sheds
its influence throughout their unlimited
existence, wringing the curse
from its every instant, and leaving a
blessing in its stead. The Gospel sets
before us an array of motives, concerning
which it is no boldness to
say, that, if ineffectual, it is because
we are immovable; if heaven fails
<span class="pagenum" id="p458">[p.&nbsp;458]</span>
to attract, hell to alarm&mdash;the heaven
and the hell opened to us by the revelation
of Scripture&mdash;it can only be
because of a set determination to continue
in sin. <i>What more could have
been done for the vineyard?</i> If you are
waiting to be forced, you are waiting
to be ruined. &ldquo;Seek the Lord
while He may be found; call on Him
while He is near.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Henry Melvill,
B.D.: Golden Lectures,</i> pp. 485&ndash;492.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 class="tdc" id="o346"><span class="smcap">Moral Perversity.</span></h3>

<p class="bq">v.&nbsp;20. <i>Woe unto them that call evil good, &amp;c.</i></p>

<p>If the judgments of men are habitually
influenced by their affections, it
is not surprising that their speech
should bear the impress of the same
controlling power. What we hear
men say in the way of passing judgment
upon things and persons, unless
said deliberately for the purpose of
description, will afford us, for the most
part, a correct idea of their dispositions
and prevailing inclinations.
There is, indeed, a customary mode of
talking in which familiar formulas of
praise and censure as to moral objects
are employed as if by rote; but this
dialect, however near it may approach
to that of evangelical morality, is still
distinguished from it by indubitable
marks. One who thus indulges in the
use of such expressions as imply a recognition
of the principles of Biblical
morality, but whose conduct repudiates
them, in expressing his opinions
on moral subjects avoids, as if instinctively,
the terms of censure and
of approbation which belong to Scripture.
He will speak of an act or a
course of acts as wrong, perhaps as
vicious,&mdash;it may even be as wicked,
but not as <i>sinful.</i> There are crimes
and vices, but no sins in his vocabulary.
Vice and sin are referable, it would
seem, to an abstract and perhaps
variable standard, while sin brings
into view the legislative and judicial
character of God. Two men shall
converse together upon truth and
falsehood, employing the <i>same</i> words
and phrases; and yet when you come
to ascertain the sense in which they
severally use the same language, you
shall find that while the one adopts
the rigorous and simple rule of truth
and falsehood laid down in the Bible
and by common sense, the other holds
it with so many qualifications and exceptions
as almost to render it a rule
more honoured in the breach than the
observance. But who does not know
that men are often worse in the bent
of their affections than in the general
drift of their discourse? If we err,
therefore, in the application of the test
proposed, we are far more apt to err
in favour of the subject than against
him. He who is invariably prompted,
when there is no counteracting influence,
to call evil good and good
evil, is one who, like the fallen angel,
says in his heart, &ldquo;Evil, be thou my
good!&rdquo; and is, therefore, a just subject
of the woe denounced by the prophet
in the text.</p>

<p><b>I. The expression is descriptive of
those who hate good and love evil&mdash;not
of those who err as to what is
good and what is evil.</b> A rational
nature is incapable of loving evil,
simply viewed as evil, or of hating
good when simply viewed as good.
Whatever thing you love, you thereby
recognise as good; and what you hate
or abhor, you thereby recognise as
evil. No man can dislike a taste, or
smell, or sound which at the same
time he regards as pleasant, nor can
he like one which he thinks unpleasant.
But change the standard of
comparison, and what appeared impossible
is realised. The music which
is sweetest to your ear may be offensive
when it breaks the slumber of
your sleeping friend; the harshest
voice may charm you when it announces
that your friend still lives.
The darling sin is hated by the sinner
as the means of his damnation, though
he loves it as the source of present
<span class="pagenum" id="p459">[p.&nbsp;459]</span>
pleasure. When, therefore, men profess
to look upon that as excellent
which in their hearts and lives they
treat as hateful, and to regard as evil
and abominable that which they are
seeking after and which they delight
in, they are not expressing their own
feelings, but assenting to the judgment
of others. And if they are
really so far enlightened as to think
sincerely that the objects of their passionate
attachment are evil, this is
only admitting that their own affections
are disordered and at variance
with reason. It is as if a man&rsquo;s sense
of taste should be so vitiated through
disease, that what is sweet to others
is to him a pungent bitter. So the
sinner may believe, on God&rsquo;s authority
or man&rsquo;s, that sin is evil and holiness
is good, but his diseased eye will still
confound light with darkness, and his
lips, whenever they express the feelings
of his heart, will continue to call
good evil and evil good.</p>

<p>The three forms of expression in
the text appear to be significant of
one and the same thing. The thought
is clothed first in literal and then in
metaphorical expressions. The character
thus drawn is generally applicable
to ungodly men. If the verse
be taken merely in this general sense,
the woe which it pronounces is a
general woe, or declaration of Divine
displeasure and denunciation of impending
wrath against the wicked
generally, simply equivalent to that in
chap. iii.&nbsp;11.</p>

<p>Such a declaration, awful as it is,
would furnish no specific test of character,
because it would still leave the
question undecided who it is that
chooses evil and rejects good. But
the prophet is very far from meaning
merely to assert the general liability
of sinners to the wrath of God. In
view of the context, then, consider&mdash;</p>

<p><b>II. An enumeration of particular
offences then especially prevailing.</b>
The text is the fourth in a series of
six woes denounced upon as many
outward manifestations of corrupt affection
then especially prevalent, but
by no means limited to that age or
country; and these are set forth, not
as the product of so many evil principles,
but as the varied exhibition of
that universal and profound corruption
which he had just asserted to
exist in general terms. 1.&nbsp;<i>The avaricious
and ambitious grasping after great
possessions, not merely as a means of
luxurious indulgence, but as a distinction
and a gratification of pride</i> (ver. 8). To
such the prophet threatened woe
(ver. 9), and to such the Apostle James
also (James v.&nbsp;4). 2.&nbsp;<i>Drunkenness</i> (ver.
11). Here also the description of the
vice is followed by its punishment, including
not only personal but national
calamities, as war, desolation, and captivity.
3.&nbsp;<i>Presumption and blasphemy</i>
(vers. 18, 19). 4.&nbsp;<i>Moral perversity,</i> as
set forth in the text. 5.&nbsp;<i>Overweening
confidence in human reason as opposed to
God&rsquo;s unerring revelation</i> (ver. 21).
6.&nbsp;<i>Drunkenness, considered,</i> not as in the
former case, as a personal excess, producing
inconsideration and neglect of
God, but <i>as a vice of magistrates and
rulers, and as leading to oppression and
all practical injustice</i> (vers. 22, 23).</p>

<p>This view of the context is given
for two reasons&mdash;1.&nbsp;To show that in
this whole passage the prophet refers
to species of iniquity familiar to
our own time and country; and
2.&nbsp;Chiefly to show that we have in the
text the description of a certain outward
form in which the prevailing
wickedness betrayed itself. An outward
mark of those who hate God
and whom He designs to punish is
their confounding moral distinctions
in their conversation. Consider, then&mdash;</p>

<p><b>III. How moral distinctions are
confounded.</b> When one admits in
words the great first principles in
morals, yet takes away so much as to
obliterate the practical distinction between
right and wrong, truth and
falsehood, religion and irreligion, he
does virtually, actually, call evil good
and good evil. When one admits
generally the turpitude of fraud, impurity,
intemperance, malignity, &amp;c.,
and yet in insulated cases treats these
as peccadilloes, inadvertences, &amp;c.,
he cannot be protected by the mere
<span class="pagenum" id="p460">[p.&nbsp;460]</span>
assertion of a few general principles
from the fatal charge of calling evil
good. And as a counterpart of this,
he who praises and admires all goodness
in the abstract, but detests it
when realised in concrete excellence,
really and practically calls good evil.
And he who, in relation to the self-same
acts performed by different men,
has a judgment suited to the case
of each, all compassion to the wilful
transgressions of the wicked, and all
inexorable sternness to the infirmities
of godly men, to all intents and purposes
incurs the woe pronounced on
those who call evil good and good evil.
These distinctions may at present
appear arbitrary, frivolous, or false,
and, as a necessary consequence, the
guilt of confounding them may almost
fade to nothing,&mdash;to a stain so faint
upon the conscience as to need no
blood of expiation to remove it. But
the day is coming when the eye of
reason shall no longer find it possible
to look at light and darkness as the
same, and the woe already heard shall
then be seen and felt. From the
darkness and bitterness of that damnation
may we all find deliverance
through Jesus Christ our Lord!&mdash;<i>J.
Addison Alexander, D.D.: The Gospel
of Jesus Christ,</i> pp. 568&ndash;578.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 class="tdc" id="o347"><span class="smcap">The Service of the Seraphim.</span></h3>

<p class="bq">vi.&nbsp;1, 2, 5&ndash;7. <i>I saw also the Lord, &amp;c.</i></p>

<p>In that perfect prayer which our
Lord bequeathed to His disciples we
are taught to ask that God&rsquo;s will may
be done in earth as it is done in
heaven. Thus angelic service is set
before us as a model and pattern. Not
that the services we are called upon to
render are the same with those assigned
to angels. Their sphere is heaven,
ours for the present is the earth; and
each of these spheres has its distinct
and peculiar duties, appropriate to the
nature and faculties of its occupants.
But the spirit in which the employment
of angels and men should be
prosecuted is the same. One common
sentiment&mdash;the sentiment of adoration
and devotedness&mdash;should animate and
govern them all. Hence the passage
before us, although containing a record
of the transactions of another sphere,
contains a lesson, if not respecting the
nature of our duties, yet respecting
the method in which we should seek
to fulfil them.</p>

<p><b>I. The twofold life of a servant of
God, whether human or angelic, is
here very beautifully exhibited to us.</b>
The seraphim are represented as veiling
their faces and feet with their
wings while they stand in adoration
before the throne of God. But although
engaged in ceaselessly adoring
the Divine perfections, they do not
lead a life of barren contemplation.
The words, &ldquo;with twain he did fly,&rdquo;
intimate to us that they are also engaged
in the active execution of those
errands with which God has charged
them. The Christian&rsquo;s life, like that of
the seraphim, branches out into the
two great divisions of contemplative
devotion and active exertion. It is
the life of Mary <i>combined</i> with that of
Martha (P.&nbsp;D. 2417).</p>

<p>1. <i>The devotional branch of the Christian&rsquo;s
life.</i> In the exercises of the
closet and of the sanctuary are to be
found the springs of the Christian&rsquo;s
exertions in his Master&rsquo;s cause. These
exercises are not originating sources
of grace, but they are channels and
vehicles through which God&rsquo;s Spirit
conveys Himself to the soul&mdash;pitchers
in which may be drawn up the waters
of the River of Life to refresh and
recruit the energies of him whom a
painful resistance to evil within and
without has rendered weary and faint
in his mind (H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I. 3426, 4107,
4108, and 3438&ndash;3448). If devotion
be essential to the perfection of a
seraph&rsquo;s service, how much more essential
must it be to ours, our necessities
being so immensely greater than those
of the bright inhabitants of heaven!
<span class="pagenum" id="p461">[p.&nbsp;461]</span>
The exigencies of our time make devotion
especially needful now. The
present is emphatically a period of the
world&rsquo;s history in which &ldquo;many run
to and fro, and knowledge is increased.&rdquo;
Moreover, there is a revival
of outward energy and activity in the
cause of religion. This is a blessing.
But remember, days of excitement
are not days of deep devotion. There
may be much of rapid movement
abroad in the world without a corresponding
adoration of God in the
secret chamber of the heart&mdash;much of
flying without veiling of the
<span class="wsnw">face.<a id="o347_fna1" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#o347_fn1">[1]</a></span></p>

<p>2. <i>The outward manifestation of the
Christian life</i> discernible by the world.
Care must be taken not only that the
lamp shall be filled with oil, but that
there shall be a light shining before
men (Matt. v.&nbsp;16; H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I. 1042,
1044, 3906). The seraphim are not
so wrapt up in adoration of God
that they are forgetful of active service.
&ldquo;With twain they did fly&rdquo; for the
execution of the errands on which
they were commissioned.</p>

<p>Here is a reproof of the monastic
principle, that seclusion from the
society of our fellow-men and from
the active duties of life is necessary
in order to secure an uninterrupted
period of leisure for solitary spiritual
exercises. Undue predominance is
thus given to one branch of God&rsquo;s
service, to the prejudice and neglect
of the other and no less important
branch. Exercise as well as nourishment
and repose is essential to the
health of the body, and so toil in the
vineyard&mdash;earnest endeavour to advance
the kingdom of God in our own
hearts and the hearts of others&mdash;is no
less essential to the health of the soul.
&ldquo;They that wait upon the Lord shall
renew their strength;&rdquo; but for what
purpose? That they may walk in
good works, and run with patience
the race that is set before them (chap.
xl.&nbsp;31; H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I. 1736&ndash;1742).</p>

<p><b>II. Some practical lessons concerning
the maintenance and manifestation
of the twofold Christian
life.</b></p>

<p>1. <i>A lesson as to the spirit which
should pervade all devotion.</i> These
bright and glorious beings are without
sin. Still, such is their sense of the
infinite distance between themselves
and their Creator, that they veil their
faces and their feet before His throne
in token of adoring reverence. The
first and most essential element of devotion
is a feeling of deep awe flowing
from a sense of God&rsquo;s transcendent
excellences and leading to profound
self-abasement (H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I. 3798, 3799,
5074). If reverence was befitting in
the seraphim, how much more is it
necessary in sinful men! (Luke xviii.&nbsp;13;
Ezra ix.&nbsp;6).</p>

<p>The vision of God wrought in Isaiah
a feeling almost akin to despair. It
seemed to him as if the perfect holiness
of God was engaged to banish
for ever every creature possessing the
slightest taint of moral evil (ver. 5).
In vers. 6, 7 we have the glorious
remedy. What is the significance of
the symbols? By the work of the
Son of God a mighty Altar of Propitiation
has been reared up, and
thence there comes to the penitent
sinner cleansing as well as pardon.
The &ldquo;live coal&rdquo; is an emblem of that
love and zeal in God&rsquo;s service with
which the Holy Spirit imbues the
souls of these who flee to the Altar of
Atonement as their only refuge from
the wrath to come. A participation
in that Spirit&rsquo;s influence is absolutely
essential to our true participation in
the chorus of the angelic host (H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I.
2887).</p>

<p>2. <i>A few words on that active service
which is the outward manifestation of the
principles nourished by devotion.</i>
(1.)&nbsp;We must prepare for it by the care
and culture of our own
<span class="wsnw">heart.<a id="o347_fna2" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#o347_fn2">[2]</a></span>
(2.)&nbsp;There is also an outward work which
God has made binding on all of us.
He has assigned to each of us a certain
position in life. Every such position
involves its peculiar responsibilities,
snares, and occupations. The responsibilities
must be cheerfully and
manfully met, the occupations diligently
fulfilled, as a piece of task-work
allotted to us by the Lord of the vineyard
(Eph. vi.&nbsp;7). Besides, God has
<span class="pagenum" id="p462">[p.&nbsp;462]</span>
intrusted to us, in various measures,
substance, time, abilities influence,
and these we are diligently to use for
the promotion of the cause of God in
the world. In our busy path through
life, which brings us in contact with
so many individuals, opportunities are
ever and anon presented to us of being
useful to our fellow-men; and to watch
for, seize, and improve such opportunities
is not the least important of
these branches of active service (P.&nbsp;D.
40, 3567, 3569).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Conclusion.</span>&mdash;1.&nbsp;It is not the intrinsic
dignity of our duties, nor the
large result of our fulfilment of them,
which renders the diligent performance
of them an acceptable work in God&rsquo;s
eyes. The great design of our being
places in this world is not that we
may do some signal service, or large
amount of service, to our Creator, but
rather that we may execute the service
(be it great or small) allotted to
us in a spirit of fidelity, zeal, and love.
The spirit which is thrown into and
pervades the work is everything&mdash;the
work itself (comparatively) nothing.
Be the sphere what it may which
Divine Providence has assigned to us, let
the duties of it be executed in a seraphic
spirit (P.&nbsp;D. 1484). 2.&nbsp;We have
overwhelming motives, if we did but
rightly appreciate them, to devotedness
of our every faculty to the services
of our God. The redeemed sinner
owes to God far more of allegiance
than the angel who has retained his
integrity. Angels no such Fall have
known, &ldquo;angels no such Love have
known,&rdquo; as we.&mdash;<i>E.&nbsp;M. Goulburn,
D.C.L.: Sermons,</i> pp. 77&ndash;99.</p>

<div class="footnotes"><h4 class="tdc">FOOTNOTES:</h4>
<div class="footnote" id="o347_fn1"><p><a href="#o347_fna1"><span class="label">[1]</span></a>
If this be the case with any of us, if, with
the busy occupation of the hands in the furtherance
of religious objects, we have glimpsed
the inward life of communion with God to
decline, how painfully do we resemble those
virgins who took no heed to provide for their
dying lamps a continual supply of oil! The
profession which we have made before men,
however bright its blaze, will one day be shown
to have been delusive&mdash;to have been destitute
of those animating principles of faith and love
from which alone can flow an acceptable service.&mdash;<i>Goulburn.</i></p></div>

<div class="footnote" id="o347_fn2"><p><a href="#o347_fna2"><span class="label">[2]</span></a>
God requires us to set a strict watch
over its outgoings&mdash;a watch such as sentinels
keep over the persons and goods which pass
out of a city whose allegiance to the sovereign
is suspected&mdash;to curb and quell at the earliest
outbreak every rising of vanity, temper, bitterness,
passion, and lust&mdash;to drag forth from
its dark recesses and to stay every cherished
iniquity which has found there a harbour and
a hiding-place. Our own heart is a vineyard
over which God hath set every one of us to
dress it and to keep it. We are to extirpate
the soil&rsquo;s poisonous produce, and to implore
upon the soil of this vineyard the precious dews
of the Divine Spirit, which may remedy its
native barrenness and turn it from a desert
into the garden of the Lord.&mdash;<i>Goulburn.</i> See
also H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I. 1841, 1842, 2695&ndash;2708.</p></div>

<h3 class="tdc" id="o348"><span class="smcap">The Moral History of a Rising Soul.</span></h3>

<p class="bq">vi.&nbsp;5&ndash;8. <i>Then said I, Woe is me, &amp;c.</i></p>

<p>Whilst holiness is the normal, depravity
is the actual state of man. A
restoration to that spiritual condition
is his profoundest necessity, his want
of wants. The recovery of holiness
involves the recovery of all other good.
There seem to be, in the nature of the
case, <i>five states through which the soul
must pass in this all-important and glorious
transit.</i></p>

<p>I. <span class="smcap">A vision of the Great Ruler
as the holiest of beings.</span> Isaiah
had this: &ldquo;Mine eyes have seen the
King, the Lord of hosts.&rdquo; Three
facts will show that a spiritual vision
of God is the first step of the soul
towards holiness. 1.&nbsp;<i>There can be no
excitement of the moral sensibilities and
powers without a vision of God.</i> Show
me a soul that has never had an inner
vision of God, and you show me a soul
whose conscience, whose moral powers,
are entirely dormant. The passions,
the intellect, the imagination may
move, but the conscience, the heart,
the moral essence, the <i>self</i> of the man,
moves not&mdash;is dead. 2.&nbsp;<i>The means
which God has ever employed to restore
men are visions of Himself.</i> What is
the Bible but a record of Divine visions
and manifestations to man? What
is the Gospel&mdash;&ldquo;God&rsquo;s power unto
<span class="pagenum" id="p463">[p.&nbsp;463]</span>
salvation&rdquo;&mdash;but the manifestation of
the Eternal in Christ? Here He appears
to man in the &ldquo;face of Jesus
Christ.&rdquo; 3.&nbsp;<i>The history of all restored
souls shows that the improvement commences
at this stage.</i> The explanation
which Paul gives of the first upward
movement would generally be true
of all: &ldquo;When it pleased God to reveal
His Son in me,&rdquo; &amp;c. What the sun is
to the plant, God is to the soul.</p>

<p>II. <span class="smcap">A profound consciousness of
our fallen state.</span> &ldquo;Then, said I,
Woe is me,&rdquo; &amp;c. His consciousness
included four things&mdash;1.&nbsp;<i>A deep sense
of his personality.</i> &ldquo;<i>I</i> am undone.&rdquo;
He feels himself singled out from the
millions. When conscience is touched,
she breaks the bond, individualises
the man, and makes him feel as if he
stood alone before the Eternal Judge.
2.&nbsp;<i>A sense of personal ruin.</i> &ldquo;Woe is
me, for I am undone.&rdquo; My prospects
are blighted, my hopes are gone.
3.&nbsp;<i>A sense of personal ruin arising from a
sense of personal sin.</i> &ldquo;I am a man
of unclean lips;&rdquo; I am a sinner, and
therefore &ldquo;undone.&rdquo; 4.&nbsp;<i>A sense of
personal sin, heightened by the remembrance
of his neighbour&rsquo;s sins.</i> &ldquo;I dwell
in the midst of a people of unclean
lips.&rdquo; So long as conscience is torpid,
men often make the sinful conduct of
others an apology for their own; but
when conscience awakes, such sophistries
depart.</p>

<p>III. <span class="smcap">A removal of the crushing
sense of guilt.</span> &ldquo;Then flew one of
the seraphim unto me, having a live
coal in his hand,&rdquo; &amp;c. Three thoughts
are suggested by this&mdash;1.&nbsp;<i>There are
Divine means for the removal of sin.</i>
This &ldquo;live coal,&rdquo; this altar, and seraphim
in the vision, symbolise this
truth. 2.&nbsp;<i>The means are something in
connection with sacrifice.</i> Fire is a purifying
element, and is regarded as the
emblem of purity. This &ldquo;live coal&rdquo;
was taken from the altar of burnt-offering.
The fire of that altar as at
first kindled by the Lord, and ever
afterward kept burning. What is
the power that takes away sin? The
Divine Word in connection with
Christ&rsquo;s sacrifice&mdash;the doctrine of the
Cross. This, like &ldquo;fire,&rdquo; has a purifying
power. 3.&nbsp;<i>The means are employed
by a Divinely-appointed ministry.</i> Let
that seraph stand as the emblem of
a true minister, and we see that his
work is to take the purifying elements
from the altar and apply them to men.</p>

<p>IV. <span class="smcap">An ever-open and sensitive
ear to the voice of God.</span> &ldquo;I heard
the voice of the Lord, saying,&rdquo; &amp;c.
Three thoughts will develop the
general and practical meaning of
these words&mdash;1.&nbsp;<i>God has deep thoughts
about our race.</i> The Bible reveals some
of these thoughts, and so does Nature.
2.&nbsp;<i>Just as the soul is cleared of sin does it
become conscious of these thoughts.</i> Let
the conscience be thoroughly cleared
of sin, and it will hear the voice of God
in every sound and see His glory in
every form. The universe to a holy
being is the tongue of God (P.&nbsp;D.
2545, 2552, 2560, 2563, 2564).
3.&nbsp;<i>This consciousness of the Divine thoughts
about our race is a necessary stage in the
moral progress of the soul.</i> It is only
thus we walk with God, as Enoch did
of old.</p>

<p>V. <span class="smcap">A hearty readiness to do
what the Supreme Will commands.</span>
&ldquo;Here am I; send me.&rdquo; I am ready
to do whatever Thou commandest.
Send me anywhere, at any time, to do
any work; I am ready to catch the
slightest whisper of duty; my soul
stands with plumed pinions.&mdash;<i>David
Thomas, D.D.: The Homilist,</i> vol. v.
pp. 411&ndash;418.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 class="tdc" id="o349"><span class="smcap">Sanctuary in God.</span></h3>

<p class="bq">viii.&nbsp;14. <i>And He shall be for a sanctuary.</i></p>

<p>Not a few mourn, in the midst of a
busy, bustling age, the loss of sacredness
in life. Not the false &ldquo;sacred&rdquo;&mdash;that
which is merely ascetic separation
from life and duty; nor that which
is merely solemn &ldquo;sacred&rdquo;&mdash;the dull
heavy monotony of gloominess.</p>

<p>We naturally say that if this is
<span class="pagenum" id="p464">[p.&nbsp;464]</span>
God&rsquo;s world, if civil and civic duties,
social responsibilities, are God-ordained,
it is likely, at least, that <i>here</i>
we may be able to secure a heavenly
citizenship amid earthly cares and
customs. This is exactly what God
reveals in the text. Sanctuary, He
says, is <i>not</i> in mere place; <i>not</i> in
separation from manly duty; I open
up my very <i>nature</i> to you. How often
this idea recurs in the Scriptures!
God is our refuge and rest, our hiding-place,
our dwelling-place.</p>

<p>I. <span class="smcap">The sacredness that a reverent
heart desires.</span> Something within
us asserts its dignity when society is
frivolous and gay, and when the routine
of life brings us into association
with lives where the light even of
conscience burns low, when the reverent
<i>wonder</i> that filled even pagan
hearts has given place to scientific explanations
of every spiritual function.
When we are brought into contact
with all this, then it is that we find
how the high tides of the world cover
the little green knolls of devotion, and
sweep away alike the altar of prayer
and the harp of praise. In all earnest
natures there comes, at times, resentment
at all this. We believe the
Divinity within us. We believe the
high call of seer and prophet to nobler
ends; we believe, above all, that Lord
of life and light who tells us that the
life is more than meat, and who fed
His own life by the mountain prayer
and the garden solitude. We should
seek to secure the sacredness we feel
we need, not in morbid methods, but
in ways that are human, and ways
that are Divine because they are
human. Christ lived and worked
amongst men. We, too, may secure
sacredness for our lives; we may carry
in our mien and breathe in our converse
the springs of hope and faith
and love which flow still from Zion&rsquo;s
sacred hill.</p>

<p>II. <span class="smcap">The sacredness that makes
sanctuary in God himself.</span> &ldquo;<i>He</i>
shall be for a sanctuary.&rdquo; He whom
wicked men dread and flee from; for,
as of old, darkness cannot dwell with
light, nor irreverence with reverence,
nor mammon-worship with devotion
to God. We may carry very bad
hearts into very beautiful places.
Place is easily made unsacred, but
into fellowship with God there can
enter nothing that is false, or worldly,
or vile. &ldquo;Sanctuary in a person?&rdquo;
Yes; for even here, in this dim sphere
of earthly friendship, our best sanctuaries,
apart from Christ, have been
men and women,&mdash;those who bear
His likeness, and who do His will.
&ldquo;Sanctuaries?&rdquo; Yes; for with them
we are ashamed of unworthy motive,
of impure thought, of unsacred aim.
Take Christ with you, and every place
is sacred. This is our living sanctuary;
we abide in Him who says, &ldquo;I
am He that liveth, and was dead, and
behold I am alive for evermore.&rdquo; And
if by His own Divine nature He is a
sanctuary, He is also by <i>experience</i> too.
How much the human sanctuary of
friendship is beautified when there is
<i>oneness of feeling</i> about the battle and
burden of life! It is nothing, then,
that when we speak of sanctuary in
Christ we should mean &ldquo;sympathy,&rdquo;
all that belongs to a brother born for
adversity&mdash;to Him who, as a &ldquo;Man of
Sorrows,&rdquo; was &ldquo;acquainted with grief&rdquo;
(liii.&nbsp;9)? We know indeed but
little of the realities of religion unless
we have found such a living sanctuary
in Christ Jesus the Lord (H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I.
968&ndash;975).</p>

<p>III. <span class="smcap">The sacredness of all the
future days.</span> &ldquo;He shall be.&rdquo;
Names vary in interpreting what
God is to suit need and experience.
We translate the want, and then
God&rsquo;s name is translated to meet it.
I am hungry&mdash;He is Bread; thirsty&mdash;He
is Water, &amp;c. The word &ldquo;sanctuary&rdquo;
meets special wants. Life is
not always a seeking for a refuge, but
it is so especially at certain times and
in strange and desolate experiences.
We are alone in a strange city. The
child must leave home to teach, to
toil, to live; the weakness will come
which presaged decline and death;
the soul does feel that some lights are
lost to faith and that others are going
dim. He <i>shall</i> be for a sanctuary.
<span class="pagenum" id="p465">[p.&nbsp;465]</span>
Let the hours come; He will come
too. Who can make retreat into his
own heart and find perfect sanctuary
there? Christ alone could do <i>that.</i>
We cannot. Nature cannot afford us
the sanctuary we need; she has
healthy anodynes of atmosphere that
afford us deep and quiet retreats, but
sanctuary, in the highest sense, she
has not. Christ, and He alone, will
be now and for ever a sanctuary (H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I.
2378&ndash;2387).</p>

<p>IV. <span class="smcap">The sacredness of personal
life in God.</span> We can have no safety
or rest in Churches as such. They are
helpful; they are houses of fellowship
and centres of usefulness. But we
cannot say, as Medi&aelig;valism said,
&ldquo;Enter the Church and be saved.&rdquo;
The soul&rsquo;s relation to God is personal
and individual. Whether this relation
of faith is real, vital, each soul can
attest for itself; and that living relationship
is all that can ever make
life sacred to any man. When the
life is hid with Christ in God, all is
well, for all is sacred; and nothing
that He has created us to do or to
enjoy is common or unclean. So
may God help us to keep a sacred life
which finds sanctuary in the Saviour,
until we find it where there is no
temple, but where there is sanctuary
in God (Rev. xxi.&nbsp;22, 23).&mdash;<i>W.&nbsp;M.

<h3 class="tdc" id="o350"><span class="smcap">Wise Lessons from Wicked Lips.</span></h3>

<p class="bq">ix.&nbsp;10. <i>The bricks are fallen down, &amp;c.</i></p>

<p>Jesus said, &ldquo;The children of this
world are in their generation wiser
than the children of light,&rdquo; meaning
that they excel them in shrewdness
and tact. Men of the world do not
readily submit to defeat and failure,
but strive to convert defeat into victory,
and failure into success. In this
respect, therefore, the children of this
world are worthy of imitation. Within
the spiritual, Christian sphere we might
well emulate them in the determined,
hopeful, persevering, progressive, patient
spirit with which they prosecute
their affairs. Of this the text affords
illustration. The children of this
world, of whom it speaks to us, are
worthy of our imitation in the following
respects:&mdash;</p>

<p><b>I. They proceed with a defined
purpose.</b> The bricks mentioned as
having fallen down were not a heap
of burned clay, which somehow had
got piled up, no one could tell how.
They had been built by human hands,
and the builders had heads as well as
hands. But now that the bricks had
fallen, in making up their minds as
to what should be done, they proceed
with a defined purpose. The architect
precedes the builder; the head
leads the hand. They build not at
random. They first say what they
will build, and how. They also resolve
once more to beautify their surroundings
with trees, and they make
their choice. This time they will not
have sycamores, but cedars.</p>

<p>The same principle should underlie
the building up of all Christian character
and work. Knowledge and
zeal should ever be in partnership.
The hand should be under control of
the head. Everything should be done
well, because done wisely. One purpose
should run through and be
supreme in each life. Striving, and
toiling, and fighting, we should have
it first settled what we are to strive,
and toil, and fight for. And as to this
we are left in no difficulty. A plan is
made for us, and our wisdom is to
work it out. A number of young men
were one day practising archery, when
the arrows of one invariably stuck in
the ground. Seeing this, one of his
companions cried out, &ldquo;Do aim
higher.&rdquo; That is what we have to do.
We substitute our own low, faltering
purposes for the high, glorious purpose
of God (Rom. viii.&nbsp;29; 1&nbsp;Pet. ii.&nbsp;21).
So, also, in connection with our work,
a high purpose should be our aim.
We should not make up our minds to
<span class="pagenum" id="p466">[p.&nbsp;466]</span>
do as little as possible, neither should
our only object be to do as much as
possible. Our question should be,
What is my Master&rsquo;s will? Obedience
is better than sacrifice. They who
would work for their Lord with acceptance
must wait on Him, and He
will give &ldquo;to each man his work.&rdquo;
Further, with our plan fixed, we must
set our whole heart upon the working
of it out. Here Israel teaches us.
When her first effort failed, she tried
again. The spirit of enthusiasm must
inspire us. This is what makes
labour rest, and turns the yoke into a
crown.</p>

<p><b>II. They were inspired with hopefulness.</b>
Their bricks fell down, but
their spirits fell not into the pit of
despair. Their sycamores were cut
down, but their ambition was not.
They viewed the desolation not without
sadness, but in the midst of it
all <span lang="la">&ldquo;Nil Desperandum&rdquo;</span> was the song
which they sang. And that is the
spirit of the world to-day. So the
Christian ought to be hopeful. You
have fallen! Say, &ldquo;I will rise again.&rdquo;
Your schemes have failed! Say, &ldquo;I
will try again.&rdquo; You are afraid you
have laboured in vain! Say, &ldquo;In
labours I will be more abundant.&rdquo;
You went into what you thought the
paradise of God, but lo! it turned out
to be a dreary wilderness. What
then? Still hope in God. Seek on,
O seeker, and thou shalt find. Knock
on, louder and louder; the door will
be opened.</p>

<p>Night must give way to day. Mystery
after mystery will unfold itself.
Light will appear to every man having
eyes and using them. The children
of this world hope; greater reason
have they to hope who are children of
God.</p>

<p><b>III. They show a spirit of industrious
perseverance.</b> Their hands responded
to the impulse of their hearts.
What they were ready to say they
were ready to do. They were prepared
by hard, persevering toil to
make good their hope. These men of
Israel were at this time without God,
but they were not without common
sense. They dreamed not that by
mere wishing their ruined walls would
rise again. If they wanted new temples
and goodly cedars, they must
build and plant them. The moral
here is plan (Matt. vii.&nbsp;21). Hoping
will not do everything. It must be
backed by earnest effort. The way to
heaven is not reached by flying, but
by toiling. I am a son of God; let
me then subscribe myself &ldquo;Servant of
the Lord Jesus Christ.&rdquo; Beautiful
city of God! we hope some day to
reach thy gates of pearl and enter it,
but till then&mdash;</p>

<p class="bqpoemr">
&ldquo;Many a sorrow, many a labour,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many a tear.&rdquo;</p>

<p>To your hope add diligence. Watch
and wait, but forget not to work.</p>

<p><b>IV. They improve matters.</b> These
tumble-down buildings were, after all,
but brick; but now they would build,
not with bricks, but with hewn stones.
Around them had flourished sycamores,
but now that these were cut
down they would plant cedars. Such
is the spirit of the world. To-day is
to be an improvement upon yesterday.
<span lang="la">&ldquo;Excelsior&rdquo;</span> is added to <span lang="la">&ldquo;Nil Desperandum.&rdquo;</span>
Is not this the spirit which
ought to animate us? There is no
temper but may be improved. You
never did a thing for Jesus, let it be
ever so trifling, but you may do better
next time you try. The text speaks
to us of failure and ruin; and it shows
us that out of these greater and better
efforts arose. So should it be with
us. Has your faith given way under
the severe strain put upon it? Then
for the future you must not only have
faith, but stronger faith. In the pride
and stoutness of their hearts Israel
said, &ldquo;In the future we will do better
than we did before;&rdquo; and we must
say, not in the pride of our hearts,
but in humble dependence upon God,
strengthened with His might, &ldquo;We
count not ourselves to have attained,
neither are we already perfect; but
this one thing we do,&rdquo; (Phil. iii.&nbsp;13, 14).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Conclusion.</span>&mdash;Looking at what Israel
proposed to do, three words are
<span class="pagenum" id="p467">[p.&nbsp;467]</span>
suggested, which would be good motto
words for us to adopt. They are
<i>strength, beauty, growth.</i> 1.&nbsp;&ldquo;We will
build with stones.&rdquo; They would now
erect a strong building, one not easily
to be overthrown. This should be our
first concern. We are building not
for time, but for eternity. What is to
last must be strong. 2.&nbsp;They said,
moreover, &ldquo;We will build with hewn
stones;&rdquo; we shall go in for beauty as
well as for strength. Some of us are
strong, but we are lacking in beauty.
We are robust characters, but we are
also rough. There is a more excellent
way. Perfection of character is reached
only in so far as strength and beauty
are blended together. 3.&nbsp;There must
also be growth. Israel resolved to
plant cedars, trees which should live
and grow on for centuries. So we,
rooted and grounded in faith, and
love, and hope, should grow up in
strength and beauty. So, on and on&mdash;changing
bricks for hewn stones,
and sycamores for cedars.&mdash;<i>Adam

<h3 class="tdc" id="o351"><span class="smcap">The Diffusion of the Knowledge of God.</span></h3>

<p class="tdc">(<i>For Whit-Sunday.</i>)</p>

<p class="bq">xi.&nbsp;9. <i>The earth shall be full of the knowledge of the Lord, as the waters cover
the sea.</i></p>

<p>It was promised that &ldquo;the waters
should no more become a flood to destroy
all flesh;&rdquo; and yet a flood there
was to be, all-compassing, all-absorbing,
in God&rsquo;s good time and in His
merciful foreknowledge when He
spake the former world; but not to
destroy all flesh, but to save it; and
in the season the rain of grace descended
(xlv.&nbsp;8; Matt. vii.&nbsp;29; Ps.
xcviii.&nbsp;8).</p>

<p>How different a fulfilment was this
from that for which the apostles had
been waiting! No doubt they imagined
that such as Christ had been
would be the Paraclete who was to
come&mdash;One whose individuality and
intelligence they could not doubt, and
need not take on faith. When they
were waiting for the Angelic Messenger,
Prophet, and Lawgiver, One
higher than all created strength and
wisdom suddenly came down upon
them; yet not as a Lord and Governor,
but as an agency or power (Acts
ii.&nbsp;2&ndash;4).</p>

<p>Such was the coming of the Comforter,
He who is infinitely personal,
who is the One God, absolutely, fully,
perfectly, simply; He it was who
vouchsafed to descend upon the apostles,
and that as if not a Person, but
as an influence or quality, by His
attribute of ubiquity diffusing Himself
over their hearts, filling all the
house, poured over the world, as
wholly here as if He were not there,
and hence vouchsafing to be compared
to the inanimate and natural creation,
to water and wind, which are of so
subtle a nature, or so penetrating a
virtue, and of so extended a range.
And most exactly have these figures,
which He condescended to apply to
Himself, been fulfilled&mdash;</p>

<p>I. <span class="smcap">In the course of the dispensation
of the Spirit.</span> His operation
has been calm, equable, gradual, far-spreading,
overtaking, intimate, irresistible.
What is so awfully silent, so
mighty, so inevitable, so encompassing
as a flood of water? Fire alarms from
the first: we see it and we scent it;
there is crashing and downfall, smoke
and flame; it makes an inroad here
and there; it is uncertain and wayward;&mdash;but
a flood is the reverse of
all this. It gives no tokens of its
coming; it lets man sleep through the
night, and they wake and find themselves
hopelessly besieged; prompt,
secret, successful, and equable, it preserves
one level; it is everywhere;
there is no refuge. And it makes its
way to the foundations; towers and
palaces rear themselves as usual; they
<span class="pagenum" id="p468">[p.&nbsp;468]</span>
have lost nothing of their perfection,
and give no sign of danger, till at
length suddenly they totter and fall.
And here and there it is the same,
as if by some secret understanding;
for by one and the same agency the
mighty movement gone on here and
there and everywhere, and all things
seem to act in concert with it, and to
conspire together for their own ruin.
And in the end they are utterly removed,
and perish from off the face
of the earth. Fire, which threatens
more fiercely, leaves behind it relics and
monuments of its agency; but water
buries as well as destroys; it wipes off
the memorial of its victims from the
earth.</p>

<p>Such was the power of the Spirit in
the beginning, when He vouchsafed to
descend as an invisible wind, as an
outpoured flood. Thus He changed
the whole face of the world. For a
while men went on as usual, and
dreamed not what was coming: and
when they were roused from their fast
sleep, the work was done; it was too
late for aught else but impotent anger
and a hopeless struggle. The kingdom
was taken away from them and
given to another people. The ark of
God moved upon the face of the
waters. It was borne aloft by the
power, greater than human, which had
overspread the earth, and it triumphed,
&ldquo;Not by might, nor by power, but by
My Spirit, saith the Lord of Hosts.&rdquo;</p>

<p>II. <span class="smcap">In every human heart to
which He comes.</span> By attending to
the figure we shall understand (what
concerns us most intimately) whether
we are personally under His influence,
or are deceiving ourselves. 1.&nbsp;<i>Any
spirit which professes to come to us alone
and not to others, which makes no claim of
having moved the body of the Church at
all times and places, is not of God, but a
private spirit of error</i> (Ps. lxv.&nbsp;10&ndash;12).
2.&nbsp;<i>Vehemence, tumult, confusion, are no
attributes of that benignant flood with
which God has replenished the earth.</i>
That flood of grace is sedate, majestic,
gentle in its operations. If at any
time it seems to be violent, that
violence is occasioned by some accident
or imperfection of the earthen
vessels into which it vouchsafed to
pour itself, and is not token of the
coming of Divine Power. Ecstasies
and transports often proceed from false
spirits, who are but imitating heavenly
influences as best they may, and seducing
souls to their ruin. 3.&nbsp;<i>The
Divine baptism wherewith God visits us
penetrates through the whole soul and
body.</i> It leaves no part of us uncleansed,
unsanctified. It claims the
whole man for God. It is everywhere,
in every faculty, every affection,
every design, every work (2&nbsp;Cor. x.&nbsp;5). Thus&mdash;</p>

<p>III. <span class="smcap">The heart of every Christian
ought to represent in miniature
the whole Church.</span> One
Spirit makes the whole Church and
every member of it to be His temple.
As He gives peace to the multitude of
nations, who are naturally in discord
one with another, so does He give
an orderly government to the soul,
and set reason and conscience as
sovereigns over the inferior parts of
our nature. As He leavens each
rank and pursuit of the community
with the principles of the doctrine
of Christ, so does that same Divine
leaven spread through every thought
of the mind, every member of the
body, till the whole is sanctified. And
let us be quite sure that these two
operations of the Spirit depend upon
each other. We cannot hope for
peace at home while we are at war
abroad. We cannot hope for unity of
the faith if we are at our own private will
make a faith for ourselves. Break
unity in one point, and the fault runs
through the whole body. The flood
of God&rsquo;s grace keeps its level, and if it
is low in one place it is low in another.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Conclusion.</span>&mdash;As we would forward
that blessed time when the
knowledge of the Lord will in its
fulness cover the earth, as the waters
cover their bed, let us look at home,
and wait on God for the cleansing and
purifying of ourselves. Till we look
at home, no good shall we be able to
perform for the Church at large; we
shall but do mischief when we intend
<span class="pagenum" id="p469">[p.&nbsp;469]</span>
to do good, and to us will apply that
proverb, &ldquo;Physician, heal thyself.&rdquo;
And let us not doubt that if we do
thus proceed we shall advance the
cause of Christ in the world. Let us
but raise the level of religion in our
hearts, and it will rise in the world.
And, meantime, we shall have our
true reward, which is personal, consisting
in no mere external privileges,
however great, but in the &ldquo;water
of life,&rdquo; of which we are allowed
to take freely (Ps. xxxvi.&nbsp;7&ndash;9; i.&nbsp;3; Isa.
xxxii.&nbsp;18; Ps. xxiii.&nbsp;2).&mdash;<i>John
Henry Newman: Subjects of the Day,</i>
pp. 126&ndash;136.</p>

<h3 class="tdc" id="o352"><span class="smcap">The Proud City Doomed.</span></h3>

<p class="bq">xiii.&nbsp;1. <i>The burden of Babylon, which Isaiah the son of Amoz did see.</i></p>

<p>In 2&nbsp;Kings xvii. we find an account
of the invasion of Israel by the Assyrians
(vers. 1&ndash;6). Then follows a
long enumeration of the sins which
had brought this Divine visitation
upon the ten tribes, ending with the
words, &ldquo;So was Israel carried away
out of their own land to Assyria unto
this day&rdquo; (ver. 23). If the scourge
was no longer in the hands of the
king of Assyria, it would be transferred
to other hands not less terrible.</p>

<p>1. Would this scourge destroy the
life of the Jewish nation? This was
the awful question which presented itself
to the minds of the prophets when
they saw one and another limb of this
nation lopped off, when they saw that
a great numerical majority of the tribes
would be carried away. Isaiah&rsquo;s eyes
were opened to see whence the permanence
of the race was derived, how
great critical moments in its life discovered
Him who was everlastingly
present with it. The child born in
hours of trouble and rebuke had borne
witness to him of the continuance of
the regal family as well as of the
people of God&rsquo;s covenant, when the
rage of their enemies as well as of their
own faithlessness were threatening
them with destruction. Nor was this
all. In the miserable, heartless reign
of Ahaz the vision had been presented
to him of a &ldquo;Rod coming out of the
stem of Jesse, which should stand for
an ensign of the people. To it should
the Gentiles seek, and His rest should
be glorious.&rdquo; Consider <i>the Rod out
of Jesse, what it betokened</i> (Isa. xi.&nbsp;10&ndash;12).
The immediate fruits which
Isaiah saw coming out of this root
might have appeared in the days of
any patriotic and prosperous prince,
and did actually appear in the latter
days of Hezekiah. No doubt Hezekiah
might become, and did actually
become, &ldquo;an ensign to the nations,&rdquo;
just as Solomon had been before him,
one to whom they brought presents,
whose alliance they sought, whose
elevation out of a deep calamity was
a proof that some mighty God was
with him. But&mdash;</p>

<p>2. Though we need not seek in any
more distant days than those of Hezekiah
for a very satisfactory fulfilment
of these predictions (and let it never
be forgotten that what may seem to
us, when we look back over 3000
years, an exaggerated description of
deliverance and restoration, must have
seemed inadequate and almost cold to
those who experienced the blessing),&mdash;though
Hezekiah was a rod out of the
stem of Jesse, and though the Spirit
of the Lord did rest upon him (xi.&nbsp;2),&mdash;though
the peacefulness and order
of his last years might faithfully carry
out the symbols of the wolf and the
lamb lying down together, yet it was
no less impossible for the prophet
to think chiefly of Hezekiah when
he was uttering these words than
it would have been for him to
fancy that he was the King whom
he saw sitting on the throne, and
his train filling the temple in the
year that Uzziah died (chap. vi.&nbsp;1&ndash;4).
There was, however, this great blessing
which came to Isaiah from his
being able to connect the Divine King
with an actual man&mdash;the belief that
a man must embody and present the
<span class="pagenum" id="p470">[p.&nbsp;470]</span>
Godhead, that only in a man could its
blessedness and glory appear, acquired
a force and vividness from his hope of
Hezekiah&rsquo;s government and from his
actual experience of it, which we may
say, without rashness or profaneness,
would have been otherwise wanting in
him. In using that language, we are
only affirming that any method but
the one which we know the Divine
Wisdom has adopted for conveying a
truth to a man&rsquo;s spirit must be an imperfect
method. Hezekiah&rsquo;s existence
was necessary to the instruction of
Isaiah, and through him of all generations
to come. Perhaps Shalmaneser
and Sennacherib were, in another way,
scarcely less necessary.</p>

<p>Apparently the prophet passes in
this chapter to an entirely new subject.
The Assyrian seems to be forgotten.
He opens with the burden of
Babylon; he goes on to the burden of
Damascus, &amp;c. But Babel or Babylon
represented to the prophets the attempt
to establish a universal society,
not upon the acknowledgment of the
Divine care and protection, but upon
the acknowledgment of a mere power
in nature against which men must try
to measure their own. The order and
history of the Jewish nation were
made, from age to age, silently to testify
against it. &ldquo;Babylon is the glory
of kingdoms, the beauty of the Chaldees&rsquo;
excellency&rdquo; (ver. 19); her time
is near to come, and her days shall not
be prolonged (ver. 22). But these and
similar words must refer to more than
the destruction of a certain Chaldean
city then or afterwards. How can we
limit them to it when we find such
words as those in vers. 11&ndash;13? Instead
of being, as some suppose, an
interpolated fragment, the burden of
Babylon comes in to make all the
visitations upon the other tribes of the
earth intelligible. They are diverse
but harmonious portions of the same
Divine message to man&mdash;a message of
terror, but also of deliverance and
hope. In chap. xiv. we find how wonderfully
these are combined.</p>

<p>But though most feel something of
the grandeur of this poetry, and a few
the truth of this prophecy, we do
not enough consider upon what both
are founded. The God-Man was the
ground upon which the Jewish nation
stood; here you have the contrast&mdash;the
man-god; he would ascend up to
heaven and exalt his throne above the
stars of God. This is the natural
ruler of a society which counts the
gold of Ophir more precious than
human beings. We have here the
Babylonian power and the Jerusalem
power, that parody of human and
Divine greatness which is seen in an
earthly tyrant, that perfect reconciliation
of Divinity and humanity which
is seen in the Redeemer. Consider
both images well. Both are presented
to us; we must admire and copy
one of them; and whichever we take,
we must resolutely discard the other.
If we have ever mixed them together
in our minds, a time is at hand that
will separate them for ever. The
Babylonian mark and image, your own
evil nature, a corrupt society, the evil
spirit, have been striving to stamp
you ever since your childhood. Each
hour you are tempted to think a man
less precious than the gold of Ophir;
the current maxima of the world take
for granted that he is; you in a thousand
ways are acting on those maxims.
Oh, remember that in them, and in
the habits which they beget, lies the
certain presage of slavery for men and
nations, the foretaste of decay and
ruin, which no human contrivances
can avert, which the gifts and blessings
of God&rsquo;s providence only accelerate.
May God grant us power to
cast Babylonian principles out of our
hearts, that when they come before us
we may despise them and laugh them
to scorn, knowing that not against us
but against the Holy One the enemy
is exalting himself. In that day may
we be able to sing the song which the
prophet said should be sung in the
land of Judah (xxvi.&nbsp;1&ndash;4).&mdash;<i>F.&nbsp;D.

<p class="bq">xix.&nbsp;1&ndash;3, 14. <i>The burden of Egypt, &amp;c.</i></p>

<p>The prophecies of Isaiah take a wide
range, embrace the fortunes of almost
every nation, however remote, with
whom the Israelites were brought into
common relation, whether of policy
or commerce&mdash;Moab, Damascus, Tyre,
Babylon, Ethiopia, Egypt. The prophet
records the political and social
phenomena of his day, not with the
eye of a mere statesman or diplomatist,
but as reviewing the moral as
well as the political aspects of things,
the eternal governing laws as well
as the fitful moods and changes of a
nation&rsquo;s life, the spiritual as well as
the material forces of the world.</p>

<p>Israel, in their dread of the great
Assyrian monarchy, often cast wistful
eyes towards Egypt, where they
hoped to find a sure and powerful
ally. The Egyptians accepted their
subsidies, but thought they consulted
their own interests best by observing
what has been called amongst ourselves
a &ldquo;masterly inactivity.&rdquo; Their
strength was to sit still. They had a
large standing army; but as Rabshakeh
showed, on a memorable occasion,
that he knew (chap. xxxvi.&nbsp;6) the
nation, with all its outward semblance
of prosperity, was being eaten up with
a thousand moral and social cankers,
which corrupted the very source of all
national life. This chapter lays bare
those wounds and bruises and putrefying
sores.</p>

<p>1. <i>There was a day when Egypt had
been famous for its wisdom.</i> This wisdom
had become a thing of the past
(vers. 11, 12).</p>

<p>2. <i>There was no unity of purpose, no
coherence of action in the body politic.</i>
The true ideas of the family, of the
municipality, of the nation, were lost.
Every man was fighting against his
brother (ver. 2). It is history eternally
repeating itself; it is the lament
of Thucydides over Greece; of Horace,
Livy, and Tacitus over the corruption
of guilty imperialism, and over the
absence of the masculine, simple, republican
virtues of ancient Rome.</p>

<p>3. <i>With the decay of public virtue
comes the decay of public spirit, and
then soon follows the decay of national
strength.</i> Then comes what these old
Hebrew seers called the &ldquo;judgment;&rdquo;
God coming out of His place to visit
the earth; anarchy, internal dissolution,
collapse, conquest by the foreigner;
the giving over of the nation into the
hand of a cruel lord; the establishment
of a military despotism.</p>

<p>It were easy to point these remarks
elsewhere, but let us look at home.
Many feel that during the last decade
of years or more England has been
parting with many of her old traditions.
Some of those principles which
were merely corrupt remnants of a
social and political system which has
passed away&mdash;feudalism&mdash;we have undoubtedly
gained by losing. <i>But there
are others which we have lost, or are fast
losing, to the great detriment of the commonwealth.</i>
The high sense of duty to
the State overruling the sense of interest
in the individual citizen; the
true measure of a nation&rsquo;s wealth and
greatness, not by its revenue in pounds
sterling, but by its revenue in the
heavenly bodies, and honest hearts, and
pure, healthy homes of the people; the
noble, self-sacrificing spirit of devotion
to the call of duty; the principle of
right recognised as a higher principle
than that of expediency; a temper of
loyalty in the strict sense of the word,
of willing obedience to the law and
those who represent the law; strict
commercial integrity, and not the tricks
of trade which have been generated by
an unwholesome competition&mdash;these
are maxims of ancient wisdom which
made England great, and the loss of
which will make England small. Our
greatness, whatever it has been, has
not rested so much upon material
forces, but, like Israel&rsquo;s of old, upon
moral. We can only hope that our
<span class="pagenum" id="p472">[p.&nbsp;472]</span>
position among the peoples will be
maintained as long as we hold fast
the principles by which it was won.
These privileges are not things of
chance, but the direct result of moral
laws as immutable and irreversible as
the laws which govern the physical
world. God send us statesmen who
will turn the nation&rsquo;s mind away from
delusive and partisan aims, and direct
them seriously to efforts which may
unite us all in one great crusade against
evil; in which every soldier might
certainly feel that he was fighting
under the banner of Christ, in a righteous
war, for objects which surely have
a place in the redemption which Christ
accomplished for the world.&mdash;<i>Bishop

<h3 class="tdc" id="o354"><span class="smcap">A Momentous Inquiry.</span></h3>

<p class="bq">xxi.&nbsp;11. <i>Watchman, what of the night?</i></p>

<p>Some calamity or sad moral condition
is foreseen by the prophet.
Moral evil is fitly compared to darkness.
The term &ldquo;night&rdquo; is used to express
error and sin. This was a time
of darkness. The burden of Dumah
was: &ldquo;Watchman, what of the night?&rdquo;
What is the prospect? Are there any
signs of coming day?</p>

<p>The world in its moral history had
been for the most part in darkness.
It commenced with a bright and sinless
morning; but this was succeeded
by a time of dark clouds and desolating
storms. After the Deluge the world
started anew from another head. The
new world, however, differed but little
from the old. Then God called Abraham,
and made his seed His chosen
people, through whom He might
accomplish His beneficent designs.
Outside of Judea there was not much
to dispel the darkness. Greece furnished
a Socrates and a Plato; but
because of her vices and crimes Greece
soon went down to ruin. The once
magnificent empires Egypt, Assyria,
Greece, and Rome were alike involved
in the moral night of error and sin.
We may inquire, as the voice out of
Seir did, &ldquo;Watchman, what of the
night?&rdquo; What prospect is there for
this sin-darkened world? And we
may respond in the words of the
prophet: &ldquo;The morning cometh.&rdquo;
The morning cometh; but also the
night&mdash;a night whose duration we
may not be able to tell.</p>

<p><b>I. How will this inquiry apply to
Isaiah&rsquo;s time?</b> It was indeed for
the chosen people a time of darkness.
But the day is about to break! The
breathings of better things come like
the morning air. &ldquo;The morning
cometh,&rdquo; but also the night&mdash;the
morning to the sad-hearted Jews, but
the night to others&mdash;to the Idumeans,
who had long cherished unfriendly
feelings to the Jews, and appear to
have rejoiced in their sorrow. The
voice from Dumah was probably a
sneering taunt, &ldquo;Where is now your
God in whom ye trusted?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Isaiah had a grander vision and
saw another morning. The long
night of the olden dispensation still
lingered, but the prophet saw the
breaking day, and told of the advent
of One who was to be the light and
glory of the world (ix.&nbsp;6, 7, lx.&nbsp;2, 3, 20).
The vision which Isaiah saw we
also are permitted to see. To him it
was the Saviour to come, to teach, to
suffer, to scatter the darkness; to us
it is the Saviour who <i>has</i> come, and
taught, and suffered, and died, and
rose again, and whose glorious light
has not only gilded the mountain-tops,
but is spreading over all the whole land.
And there are signs which will not
fail that his grandest visions will be
realised.</p>

<p><b>II. How will this inquiry apply to
our own times?</b> 1.&nbsp;What mysteries
has science unveiled! How great the
historical and geographical research of
our day! How successful our time
has been in bringing unity out of the
variety of the universe and harmony
out of its apparent discord! 2.&nbsp;Ours
<span class="pagenum" id="p473">[p.&nbsp;473]</span>
has been a time of moral progress.
Slavery has been abolished from our
realm. A great work has been done
for the arrest of intemperance. The
cause of missions has grown into large
proportions. 3.&nbsp;The religious progress
of the world is remarkable.
Religious liberty is rapidly spreading.
There is encouraging advance in the
social or loving element. In the
Church the working element is growing.
Never has the giving element
assumed such proportions. Amid this
varied growth there is a strong tendency
towards Christian unity. The
enemy is vigilant; it is yet the night
of battle, of temptation, and of peril,
but the morning surely cometh.</p>

<p><b>III. How will this inquiry apply to
ourselves personally?</b> 1.&nbsp;<i>There is a
night of scepticism,</i> or partial scepticism,
in which some are involved.
There are two classes of sceptics:
some are sceptics because they want
to be so; some are honest doubters, as
Thomas the disciple was&mdash;constitutionally
a doubter, but honest withal.
And therefore he did not turn away
from the light, and &ldquo;My Lord and
my God!&rdquo; exclaimed the enlightened,
convinced, and believing Thomas. To
the earnest and sincere inquirer the
response must be, &ldquo;The morning
cometh;&rdquo; if thou art willing to be
convinced, thou art not far from the
kingdom of God. If thou shouldst
reject Jesus, whither wilt thou go for
a refuge and for a guide? 2.&nbsp;<i>There is
a night of worldliness.</i> Many are living
for selfish gratification and for this
life only. For the worldly the morning
waiteth. Behold, Christ stands
at the door and knocks! His is the
light and the life of men; with His
entrance into the heart the morning
cometh. 3.&nbsp;<i>There is the night of penitential
sorrow.</i> When the morning
cometh to the awakened sinner, the
light is sometimes, as with Saul of
Tarsus, a blinding, as well as revealing
light. To him&mdash;the sorrowing, praying,
believing penitent&mdash;the morning
came. And so it ever is. 4.&nbsp;<i>There is
the night of suffering.</i> There never
comes an hour in this world when
suffering is unknown. Count it all
joy, if it must needs be that ye shall
suffer. 5.&nbsp;<i>There is the night of weariness
and disappointment.</i> The Christian
worker, toil-worn, may sometimes inquire,
&ldquo;Watchman, what of the night?&rdquo;
He has wrongly hoped, it may be, at
the same time to carry the seed-basket,
to put in the sickle, and to bring his
sheaves with him. Learn to labour
faithfully and to wait. The Son of
God is come!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Conclusion.</span>&mdash;Fail not to remember
that while the morning cometh for
all who willingly hear and obey the
Gospel, the night also cometh for the
disobedient and unbelieving. Come,
ye who wander in the darkness, while
yet there is room, to Him who is the
bright and morning star, the sun of
righteousness, the light and life of the
world, and for you there will come a
morning which will be the beginning
of a blissful, glorious, and never-ending
day.&mdash;<i>D.&nbsp;D. Currie: Christian World
Pulpit,</i> vol. vi. pp. 213&ndash;215.</p>

<h3 class="tdc" id="o355"><span class="smcap">The Blessings of the Gospel.</span></h3>

<p class="tdc">(<i>Missionary Sermon.</i>)</p>

<p class="bq">xxv.&nbsp;6&ndash;8. <i>And in this mountain, &amp;c.</i></p>

<p>What the spirit of prophecy has
here recorded is the testimony of
Jesus and of His salvation, the subject
presented to our view being <i>the blessings
of the Gospel of the Son of God.</i>
They are described in their general
nature, in their unrivalled excellence,
and in their universal extent.</p>

<p><b>I. The blessings of the Gospel are
here described in their general nature,</b>
as including instruction for the ignorant,
consolation for the sorrowful,
and life for the dead. They thus correspond
to the state of man without
the Gospel, which is a state of darkness,
misery, and death.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="p474">[p.&nbsp;474]</span>
1. <i>The natural state of fallen man is a
state of moral darkness.</i> A veil is upon
him, by which those things which
make for his peace and essentially
affect his well-being are hidden from
his eyes. It is a triple veil.
(1.)&nbsp;There is the fold of <i>native ignorance.</i>
The merely natural man is totally
ignorant of God and eternity. He
knows not whence he came or whither
he is going. He is altogether &ldquo;sensual,
having not the Spirit,&rdquo; and cannot
know those things of the Spirit of God
which are only spiritually discerned.
Hence, ever since the Fall, darkness has
covered the earth and gross darkness
the people. (2.)&nbsp;There is the yet
thicker fold of <i>moral corruption.</i> Sin
has exactly the same tendency in each
particular case as in the case of Adam.
It darkens the understanding by its
deceitfulness, as well as hardens the
heart by its malignity. It tends to
extinguish that candle of the Lord
which shines in the conscience, and to
render useless and unavailing those
other means which God has provided
for delivering us from the night of
Nature. Those in whom it reigns
choose the darkness rather than the light
because their deeds are evil (cf. Eph.
vi.&nbsp;17, 18). (3.)&nbsp;There is the fold of
<i>Satanic infatuation.</i> &ldquo;The whole world
lieth in the wicked one.&rdquo; He rules in
the hearts of all the children of disobedience;
and his kingdom is the
kingdom of delusion and darkness.
He beguiled Eve through his subtilty;
and he still labours to corrupt and
darken the minds of men (2&nbsp;Cor.
iv.&nbsp;4).</p>

<p>All this is true of all the unregenerate,
however diversified may be their
external condition and local circumstances.
Hence multitudes even of
nominal Christians are fit objects of
our compassionate care and exertion.
But the description of the text is still
more applicable to the case of heathen
nations not yet visited by the Gospel.
They have not the light which nominal
Christians do not allow to shine into
them; in general, they have <i>no</i> effectual
light. Over them is cast the veil
not merely of ignorance and sin, but
of <i>superstition</i> and <i>false religion,</i> than
which nothing can be more fatally
opposed to the entrance of light and
the operation of Divine grace. Their
very systems of religion are the means
of perpetuating folly and vice, instead
of reclaiming them to wisdom and
righteousness. In many cases that
&ldquo;religion&rdquo; sanctions and prescribes
the most cruel of sacrifices and the
most licentious of rites. In Christendom
men may be superstitious and
wicked, licentious and cruel, but it is
<i>because they neglect their religion.</i> In
heathen and Mohammedan countries,
they are so <i>because</i> they attend to their
religion. They breathe its genuine
spirit and exemplify its proper tendency.
All that is deemed sacred and
authoritative in the name of religion
unites with all the ignorance and depravity
of fallen man, and with all the
subtilty and power of the Prince of
Darkness to produce and perpetuate a
system of error and iniquity. False
religion may pretend to be a sun which
enlightens, but it is really a veil which
darkens all who come under its power&mdash;a
veil much more effectual to favour
the ravages of sin, misery, and death
than even any of the coverings previously
mentioned.</p>

<p>2. <i>Man is described in the text as
the child not only of darkness and
error, but also of misery and death.</i>
For ignorance is the mother, not of
devotion, but of sin, in all its multiplied
forms. And sin is invariably
linked to misery! The wretchedness
of men bears an exact correspondence
to their ignorance and wickedness
(Rom. iii.&nbsp;16, 17).</p>

<p>If this statement be true of natural
men in general, it is still more awfully
verified in the condition of the
heathen world in particular. Infidel
travellers who have cheated the public
from time to time by highly-coloured
pictures of the happiness of pagans,
ought not on such a point to be believed.
It cannot be that in the
dark places of the earth, the habitations
of cruelty, no groans should be
heard, no tears be seen. The fact is,
that while heathenism leaves its
<span class="pagenum" id="p475">[p.&nbsp;475]</span>
votaries to the unmitigated operation
of all these natural and moral causes
of distress which are common to man
in general, it opens many new sources
of misery, inflicts many additional
desolations, causes many forms of
terror, suffering, and destruction,
which are peculiar to itself. All men
are born to tears, because born in sin;
but the tears of pagans are often tears
of blood. Every groan they heave is
big with double wretchedness.</p>

<p>The Gospel, in its provision of blessings
for the human race, adapts itself
to that state of darkness, wretchedness,
and mortality which I have
faintly described.</p>

<p>1. <i>It removes darkness.</i> It reveals to
us the existence, character, and will of
God, our own origin, immortality, and
accountableness, the way of salvation
and the path of duty; and, used by
the Holy Spirit as His great instrument,
it changes the heart of those
who receive it, and delivers them
from the delusions and dominion of
Satan. In these several ways does
the Gospel become the instrument of
illumination. By it, and in connection
with it, God destroys the covering
which is naturally on man&rsquo;s faces, and
the veil that is spread over their
understandings and hearts. The consequence
is, in instances innumerable,
that &ldquo;beholding as in a glass,&rdquo; with
unveiled face, &ldquo;the glory of the
Lord, that are changed into the same
image from glory to glory, even as by
the Spirit of the Lord.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The glorious diffusion of light and
purity which results from Christianity
is still more striking when it obtains
access to heathen nations. In proportion
to the deeper gloom of their
former ignorance is the splendour of
the new illumination, when the Sun of
righteousness arises upon them with
healing in His beams. On such occasions,
it may be said with peculiar
emphasis, &ldquo;The entrance of Thy Word
giveth light,&rdquo;&mdash;a light which is able
to penetrate and destroy even the
thickest veil of false religion.</p>

<p>2. <i>It wipes away tears.</i> This is here
declared to be a part of its design,
and experience proves it to be one of
its actual operations (Ps. lxxxix.&nbsp;15, 16).
It leads to repentance, and so to
pardon, purity, and genuine peace. It
comforts in sorrow. It cheers in death.</p>

<p>To the heathen it is peculiarly
valuable and welcome. It opens to
them, in common with others, the
sources of spiritual enjoyment and
the hopes of eternal bliss. And besides,
it abolishes pagan cruelties and
diffuses principles of humanity and
kindness. Hence result the amelioration
of their civil institutions, the
increase of domestic happiness, and
the improvement of social life (H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I.
1122&ndash;1133).</p>

<p>3. <i>It swallows up death in victory.</i>
It delivers every believer from the fear
of death (Heb. ii.&nbsp;14, 15; H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I.
1109&ndash;1111, 1589, 1594). God will
most gloriously swallow up death in
victory when He shall actually recover
from the territories of the grave, by
His almighty power, those spoils which
death has won.</p>

<p>In proportion to its progress in
heathen countries, the Gospel will not
merely extract the sting of death, but
arrest and diminish its most awful
ravages. The waste of human life in
many pagan lands is incalculable. As
true religion increases, even in Christian
countries, wars, which it has
already rendered less sanguinary, will
be less frequent too (chap. ii.&nbsp;4).</p>

<p><b>II. The unrivalled excellence of the
blessings of the Gospel.</b> &ldquo;A feast of
fat things, a feast of wines on the lees,
of fat things full of marrow, of wines
on the lees well refined.&rdquo; Variety!
richness! abundance! (See outline <a href="#o208"><span class="smcap">The Gospel Feast</span></a>, pp. 253&ndash;256.)
Who does not recognise, in the
unrivalled excellence of the blessings
the Gospel conveys, the most powerful
arguments for missionary exertion?
Who can think of the Gospel feast,
in contrast with the famine of the
heathen, without wishing that they
also might be bidden to the heavenly
entertainment?</p>

<p><b>III. The universal extent of the
blessings of Christianity.</b> &ldquo;The Lord
of hosts shall make unto <i>all</i> people a
feast of fat things.&rdquo; 1.&nbsp;They are
<span class="pagenum" id="p476">[p.&nbsp;476]</span>
adapted to all people. 2.&nbsp;They are
sufficient for all people. 3.&nbsp;They were
designed for all people. 4.&nbsp;The wide
world shall, sooner or later, partake
of them.</p>

<p>One result of this universal spread
and triumph of Christianity is stated
in the text: &ldquo;The rebuke of His
people shall He take away from off
all the earth.&rdquo; 1.&nbsp;By the successful
exertions of God&rsquo;s people to evangelise
the world, the reproach, which is at
present too well-founded, of neglecting
to care for those who sit in darkness
and the shadow of death, shall become
no longer just and applicable. 2.&nbsp;In
consequence of the general spread and
influence of Christianity, the reproach
of Christ, the scandal of the Cross,
shall cease; and the Church, formerly
despised and laughed to scorn, shall be
held in great honour and reputation
(chap. lx.&nbsp;13&ndash;16). 3.&nbsp;The particular
reproach of spiritual barrenness&mdash;the
reproach founded on the paucity of
her converts, and the small number of
her children&mdash;shall for ever cease.
At present &ldquo;Jacob is small,&rdquo; and the
flock of Jesus is, comparatively, a little
flock. This fact has been converted
by infidels into matter of attack upon
Christianity itself. They have tauntingly
urged the narrow extent of our
religion as an argument against its
Divinity. That argument admits, even
now, of solid refutation. But in due
season the fact itself shall be altered,
and no shadow of plausibility shall be left
for the reproach (chap. liv.&nbsp;1&ndash;5).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Concluding observations.</span></p>

<p>1. The text should teach you your
personal obligations and privileges in
reference to the Gospel. The feast is
spread out before <i>you;</i> to <i>you</i> are the
blessings of it freely offered (chap.
lv.&nbsp;1&ndash;3).</p>

<p>2. The text teaches you the ground
of missionary exertions. To partake
of the feast ourselves is our first duty:
but, while we &ldquo;eat the fat and drink
the sweet,&rdquo; shall we not &ldquo;send portions
unto them for whom nothing is
prepared?&rdquo; Can any duty be more
obviously founded in reason and justice,
humanity and piety, than that of sending
the bread of life to our perishing
fellow-creatures? The most hateful
and inexcusable of all monopolies is
the monopoly of Christian truths and
consolations.</p>

<p>3. There are great encouragements
to such labour. (1.)&nbsp;The certainty of
Divine approbation. (2.)&nbsp;The certainty
of consequent success (H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I.
1166&ndash;1168). But remember, if you
would share in the triumphs of the
Gospel, you must share in the labour
and expense of their achievement.&mdash;<i>Jabez

<p>The delightfulness and value of

Consider&mdash;</p>

<p>I. <span class="smcap">The promise.</span> 1.&nbsp;<b>It is universal
in its range.</b> It is made to any

2.&nbsp;<b>It is sure.</b> Men fail for various

every Divine promise is certain to be
fulfilled (H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I. 4052, 4053).
3.&nbsp;<b>The peace which is pledged and secured
to all who will fulfil the condition
of the text is perfect</b>&mdash;so perfect that

gives in driblets. His gifts are like
Himself, perfect for their fulness, for
their suitability, for their enduring
qualities. God can keep His people
in perfect peace when the devil accuses,
when the world allures or threatens,
when sickness tries, when adversity
oppresses, even when the heart is sore
tired, and when grim death would
affright (H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I. 1253, 1893, 1894,
1911&ndash;1926; P.&nbsp;D. 2669, 2673).</p>

<p>II. <span class="smcap">The character described.</span>
<i>&ldquo;Whose mind is stayed on Thee, because

unless there be perfect confidence in
His wisdom, power, and love. Trust

confidence, and confidence strengthens
love. The whole nature must be
stayed on God, and on God only.
There must be no division in the

ye in the Lord for ever.&rdquo;</i> We trust in
the Lord when, encouraged by His
promises, we hold fast to Him. It is
nothing deeper, nothing more difficult
than that. Its very simplicity is its
difficulty. As the limpet binds itself
to the rock, and is not disturbed by
the dashing billows, so let the soul by
an ardent affection bind itself to the
Rock of Ages. The word &ldquo;ever&rdquo;
gives a wonderful expansiveness to our
text. It points at once to God&rsquo;s
eternity and man&rsquo;s immortality. He
is a being capable of being trusted for
ever, and for ever we shall be capable
of trusting Him. Our trust is to be
unlimited and unintermitted; it is to
be exercised at all times, under all
circumstances, through all ages.</p>

<p>IV. <span class="smcap">The stable foundation of
the believer&rsquo;s confidence.</span> <i>&ldquo;For
in the Lord Jehovah is everlasting strength.&rdquo;</i>
The peace must be perfect that rests
upon, and rises out of, such a solid
foundation. The mountains are &ldquo;everlasting&rdquo;
only in figure, but the foundation
on which we rest is everlasting in
fact (Ps. xci.&nbsp;1, 2).&mdash;<i>W. Burrows, B.A.</i></p>

<p class="gap" id="o356A">The world needs the message contained
in our text. Most faces that
we see are careworn. They are so
because behind them there are
anxious hearts distressed by fears of
various kinds&mdash;by fears concerning
the body, by fears concerning the soul.
The vast majority of men are destitute
of true peace; for while in the world
there are many ways&mdash;of pleasure, of
sin, of disappointment, of misery, of
death&mdash;there is no way of peace.
The multitudes who throng past us
are miserable because the way of peace
they have not known.</p>

<p>I. <span class="smcap">Look at the person who is
kept in peace.</span> He is a person whose
mind is stayed on God. A man&rsquo;s self,
sin, pleasure, false religion, vain hopes,
are every one of them troubled waves
in an ocean of disquietude, and no
soul can stay itself on them, though
many souls have sought to do so.
Who, lying down in the very midst of
the sea, can find there repose? As he
lieth down upon the waves, they yield
beneath him&mdash;the billows roll over
him; he is sinking in the mighty
deep. So with the sinner lying down in
the midst of the sea and of the storm
of this world apart from God. But
he who lieth down upon God is as a
man upon a rock, or as one in a mighty
fortress; he is at peace&mdash;secure in fact
and in feeling. But it is only as God
is revealed to us in Christ that we
may rest upon Him. Apart from
Christ, He is to sinners &ldquo;a consuming
fire.&rdquo; Only through Christ may we
find the blessedness we so much need,
but through Christ we may find it.</p>

<p>II. <span class="smcap">Look at the power which
keeps the believer in peace.</span> It
is not the power of his own faith
(H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I. 1970, 1975). It is not the
power of his own effort, struggling
to obtain confidence. It is the power
of God: &ldquo;<i>Thou</i> wilt keep him,&rdquo; &amp;c.
The sinner obtains peace by yielding
himself to God (Rom. vi.&nbsp;13). The
believer has peace while he leaves
himself in God&rsquo;s hands, quietly submissive,
cheerfully willing that God
should lead him and do with him
whatever is pleasing in His sight (P.&nbsp;D.
2966&ndash;2968, 2970&ndash;2972). Then all
God&rsquo;s attributes&mdash;His omniscience,
His omnipotence, His faithfulness,
His tender mercy&mdash;minister to his
peace (P.&nbsp;D. 3379).</p>

<p>III. <span class="smcap">Look at the peace in which
such a person is kept.</span> It is <i>&ldquo;perfect
peace.&rdquo;</i> Peace in spite of all that
conscience may say, of the temptations
that assail us, of the troubles of life,
of the certainty and mystery of death.
<span class="pagenum" id="p478">[p.&nbsp;478]</span>
With the peace of pardon, all this
peace flows into the soul, increasing
more and more. It is the peace of
Christ, the same peace which filled
and sustained Him (John xiv.&nbsp;27).
You remember that we are shown
Him with His head on a pillow, His
eyes closed, His mind in unconscious
repose, asleep in the midst of the
wild storm at night upon the Lake of
Galilee, when the waves beat upon
the trembling vessel, and the wind
strove to raise the waves still higher,
and engulph them all. He slept,
secure and peaceful, amid the storm.
So does the soul of the believer that
stayeth itself upon God. Upon what
lay that peaceful head of Jesus but
upon the unseen arm and heart of
God. Men said of Christ mockingly,
&ldquo;He trusted in God.&rdquo; He did trust
in God, as the most exalted believer,
and far more than the most exalted
believer; and in that simplicity of
faith He was kept in peace, sleeping
amidst the storm. So is it with the
believer. O believer! is it so with
you?&mdash;<i>Henry Grattan Guinness: Sermon
in The Christian World,</i> 1860.</p>

<p class="gap" id="o356B">Here is the secret of life&mdash;peace,
perfect peace&mdash;and the sure way of
attaining it. Consider&mdash;</p>

<p>I. <span class="smcap">The character contemplated.</span>
<i>&ldquo;Whose mind is stayed on Thee.&rdquo;</i> His
mind is fixed with such intensity that
it cannot be diverted from the object
on which it is set. This object is
not himself (Prov. xxviii.&nbsp;26), nor his
riches (Prov. xxiii.&nbsp;5), nor his fellow-men
(Ch. ii.&nbsp;22; Jer. xvii.&nbsp;4, 5), but
<span class="smcap">God,</span> in whom he trusts unhesitatingly,
exclusively, universally. He
accepts all that the Scriptures reveal
concerning God, and makes these
revelations the foundation of his confidence
and his prayers.</p>

<p>II. <span class="smcap">The promised blessing.</span> <i>&ldquo;Thou
wilt keep him in perfect peace.&rdquo;</i> See also
Jer. xvii.&nbsp;7. The idea suggested is
that of habitual and continued blessedness.
The elements of peace are begun
in the soul, and they are brought to
maturity in the whole course of the
future life. The peace given is like
a river (chap. lxvi.&nbsp;12), both for abundance
and permanence. That is, while,
and only while, the mind is stayed
upon God (chap. xlviii.&nbsp;18). Then he
is <i>kept</i> in peace, for God is its finisher
as well as its author; and it is &ldquo;perfect
peace,&rdquo; because it is peace of all
kinds, in its highest degree, at all times,
under all circumstances.</p>

<p>III. <span class="smcap">The reason for the bestowment
of the blessing.</span> <i>&ldquo;Because
he trusteth in Thee.&rdquo;</i> Faith honours
God (Rom. iv.&nbsp;21), and therefore those
who exercise it are honoured by Him
(1&nbsp;Sam. ii.&nbsp;30; H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I. 4057, 4058).</p>

<p>IV. <span class="smcap">The duty enjoined.</span> <i>&ldquo;Trust
ye,&rdquo;</i> &amp;c. While we are listening to
expositions of this text, this duty
seems to be easy; but in actual life
our faith is tried and often fails, because
we lose sight of the promises
and perfections of God. Here there
come to us disappointments, difficulties,
temptations to distrust. But it
is our duty to struggle with them all;
and if we do so, it will be our blessedness
to overcome them all (chap. xl.&nbsp;27&ndash;31).
&ldquo;Trust ye in the <i>Lord;</i>
trust ye in the Lord <i>for ever;</i> for in the
Lord Jehovah is <i>everlasting strength.</i>&rdquo;&mdash;<i>James Morgan,
D.D.: The Home Pulpit,</i> pp. 512&ndash;516.</p>

<p class="gap" id="o356C">There is sometimes a world of meaning
in a single word: Country, home,
<i>peace!</i> How it sometimes tells of booming
cannon hushed into silence, of
glittering swords sent back into their
sheaths, of hundreds of homes relieved
from distressing anxieties and fears,
of thousands of lives respited at least
for a time! How it sometimes tells
of surging passions hushed into a
calm, of vengeful purposes superseded,
of the fires of enmity quenched, of
despair giving place to hope and joy!
Peace has its histories, many and pleasant;
its triumphs, various and substantial;
its heralds, Divine, angelic,
human. Ministers have messages of
peace to deliver to their congregations,
and in our text we have one
of them.</p>

<p>I. <span class="smcap">The condition expressed in the
text.</span> <i>&ldquo;Whose mind is stayed on Thee.&rdquo;</i>
<span class="pagenum" id="p479">[p.&nbsp;479]</span>
It is a mind resting on God as the
God of grace reconciling sinners to
Himself through the mediation of
Christ, dispensing pardon, sanctity,
salvation&mdash;a mind resting, after reconciliation,
on His truthfulness, wisdom,
almightiness, holiness&mdash;a mind
resting on His rule and government
over all the forces of nature and all
the events of daily life, both national
and individual.</p>

<p>II. <span class="smcap">The confidence expressed in
the text.</span> <i>&ldquo;Thou wilt keep,&rdquo;</i> &amp;c. <i>Thou</i>
wilt do it; not merely delegate and
intrust this to any agency whatever.
Thou <i>wilt</i> do it; there is no uncertainty
or peradventure about it. &ldquo;In
perfect peace:&rdquo; peace of all kinds, and
in a superlative degree; peace flowing
from reconciliation; peace in the
midst of unexplained mysteries; peace
in the midst of adverse providences;
peace amid the uncertainties of the
future.&mdash;<i>John Corbin.</i></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 class="tdc" id="o357"><span class="smcap">The Song to the Vineyard.</span></h3>

<p class="bq">xxvii.&nbsp;2, 3. <i>In that day sing ye unto her, &amp;c.</i></p>

<p>There are different opinions as to
what is meant by &ldquo;leviathan, that
crooked serpent,&rdquo; and &ldquo;the dragon
that is in the sea&rdquo; (ver. 1), whether
the same power is signified by different
names, &amp;c. (1.)&nbsp;On a point concerning
which learned and able men cannot
see eye to eye, it would be presumptuous
for me to give an opinion. (2.)&nbsp;If
we cannot feel certain as to the literal
meaning, the spiritual is plain.
(3.)&nbsp;Neither of the expositions affects the
substance of the prophecy. A great
deliverance is spoken of, to be accomplished
by the destruction of the enemies
of the Church, and the Lord
gives a command to comfort His
people. There is in our text a <i>command</i>
and a <i>promise.</i></p>

<p>I. <span class="smcap">The command.</span></p>

<p>1. <i>&ldquo;Sing ye unto her.&rdquo;</i> It is taken
for granted that the spiritual condition
of the Church is pleasing to
God, but that the feeling of His
people is in a low state. Sometimes
the Lord directs His servant to reprimand
them: &ldquo;Show unto my people
their transgressions.&rdquo; A Church may
need comfort while some of its members
deserve correction. Possibly the
faulty members are the cause of the discomfort
to the Church, and render it
desirable that she should be comforted.
It is so in the family. We comfort
the family when a member of it has
transgressed. The fact that one member
needs correction causes the others
to need consolation. In some cases,
it requires much wisdom to decide
whether an encouragement or a reproof
should be given. We have seen the rod
used when a kind word would have
been more suitable; and some are
singing songs while it would be more
appropriate to sound an alarm. There
is need for rightly dividing the Word
of truth. &ldquo;A word in its season,&rdquo; &amp;c.</p>

<p>Possibly the accurate expositor will
ask who is commanded to sing. Is it
the prophets, or the priests, or the
choir of the Temple? This is a poetical
book, and sometimes it calls on the
heavens, the mountains, and the trees
of the field to sing. In this respect I
would rather let the command of the
text remain undecided, and say to
everybody and everything, &ldquo;Sing unto
her!&rdquo;</p>

<p>2. <i>What should be sung to this vineyard?</i>
Remind her in this song that
she is &ldquo;the vineyard of the Lord of
hosts.&rdquo; The Old Testament is full of
references to a vineyard, to vines, and
to wine. The reason for this is, that
the Bible is an Eastern book. A vineyard
supposes&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Separation.</i> Not the superiority
of its soil to that of the surrounding
country makes the vineyard, but its
separation. It is not because the
saints are by nature better than others
that they are God&rsquo;s vineyard, but because
they are set apart by Him. The
idea of separation as regards the
Church is made conspicuous in every
age. The saints, the disciples, constitute
<span class="pagenum" id="p480">[p.&nbsp;480]</span>
the flock and the vineyard of
the Old Testament, the Church of the
New. When I speak of a separated
Church, of course I do not allude to
any sect, but to the Church in general.
There are hypocrites in the Churches,
but none in <i>the</i> Church. It is in the
world, but not of the world. The soul
is in the body, but not of the body
&ldquo;Wherefore, come out from among
them, and be ye separate, saith the
Lord&rdquo; (2&nbsp;Cor. vi.&nbsp;17). Ceremonials
cannot plant the vine; there are
necessarily ordinances, but circumcision
could not make the Jews a
godly people, and there were thousands
of ungodly people partaking every
year of the Passover. A change of
heart, a change in the condition of the
soul, constitutes the planting in the
vineyard; not a ceremonial separation,
but a change of mind; not the affixing
of the stamp of a sect, but the impartation
of the image of God (H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I.
1171&ndash;1183).</p>

<p>II. <span class="smcap">The promise.</span></p>

<p>A large and comprehensive one. It
includes&mdash;</p>

<p>1. <i>Care.</i> &ldquo;I the Lord do keep it.&rdquo;
With regard to a vineyard, there is a
special meaning in the word &ldquo;keep.&rdquo;
The vine requires great care. There
is much work for the knife. From
the pruning of the vine by the vine-dresser,
there is much valuable instruction
to be gained. We learn
that what appear to be grievous losses
may secure great gains (H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I. 63,
104, 126). Oh, this pruning how
painful it often is! But it is not done
because the Owner of the vineyard
delights in it; it proves His love.
See Jochebed taking an ark of bulrushes,
putting the child Moses in it,
and then laying it amidst the perils of
the Nile: not because she hated him!
No; love was at the bottom of it all,
though it appeared otherwise. It behoves
the pulpit still to assure God&rsquo;s
people of His care for them.</p>

<p>2. <i>Provision.</i> &ldquo;I will water it.&rdquo;
There was necessity for watering the
vineyard constantly. This was done
by means of trenches conveying the
water to the roots of the plants. For
this purpose rain-water was carefully
stored in cisterns; dew was also of
great service. The means of grace
are somewhat like watercourses. We
are dry enough and withered in appearance,
but what would we be without
the means of grace? What is the
dew? The noiseless influences of the
Holy Spirit. We will compare revivals
to showers; they are not with
us, like the watercourses, always. I
do not know whether the natural vineyards
must have water without intermission;
but the vineyard of the
Lord of hosts requires it &ldquo;every
moment,&rdquo; and here is His promise to
supply the need.</p>

<p>3. <i>Safety.</i> &ldquo;Lest any hurt it, I
will keep it night and day.&rdquo; It shall
be protected from the blighting frost,
from thieves and spoilers, from &ldquo;the
boar out of the wood,&rdquo; from &ldquo;the
little foxes that spoil the vines.&rdquo; &ldquo;I
the Lord do keep it.&rdquo; He will not
only give His angels charge concerning
it, though He will do that. &ldquo;The
angel of the Lord encampeth round
about them that fear Him.&rdquo; That
shall be done and more! &ldquo;For <i>I,</i>
saith the Lord, will be unto her a
wall of fire round about her, and will
be the glory in the midst of her.&rdquo; All
things are in the hand of God, and
under His control they shall co-operate
for her safety. It is not surprising
that Moses, as he surveyed Israel from
the top of Mount Nebo, should say,
&ldquo;Happy art thou, O Israel! who is
like unto thee, O people saved by the
Lord, the shield of thy help? The
eternal God is thy refuge, and underneath
are the everlasting arms.&rdquo; &ldquo;He
that dwelleth in the secret place of
the Most High shall abide under the
shadow of the Almighty.&rdquo; In dwelling
near God there is safety. Israel
was always flourishing when with
God. The safety of God&rsquo;s people
means more than being kept together
and saved from destruction: &ldquo;Lest
any <i>hurt</i> it!&rdquo; How excellent are the
promises of God!&mdash;<i>Gweithiau Rhyddieithol,</i>
pp. 48&ndash;51, <i>by the late William
Ambrose of Portmadoc, translated from
the Welsh by the Rev. T. Johns, of Llanelly.</i></p>

<p>&nbsp;<span class="pagenum" id="p481">[p.&nbsp;481]</span></p>
<h3 class="tdc" id="o358"><span class="smcap">The Storms of Life.</span></h3>

<p class="bq">xxvii.&nbsp;8. <i>In measure when it shooteth forth, &amp;c.</i></p>

<p><b>I. There is a special appropriateness
in comparing the trials of life to
storms.</b> 1.&nbsp;<i>Storms are the exceptions
and not the normal or common condition
of the atmosphere.</i> &ldquo;In the world ye
shall have tribulation.&rdquo; True; but
Christ in saying so does not assert
that we shall have tribulation only.
&ldquo;Man is born unto trouble, as the
sparks fly upward.&rdquo; Yes; but it is
not said that there is nothing but
trouble. &ldquo;Through much tribulation,&rdquo;
&amp;c. Yea, through many storms
the mariner has to go through life;
but there is fine weather also.
2.&nbsp;<i>Storms come from God.</i> See what is
said about trouble (Job v.&nbsp;6), &ldquo;<i>All</i>
my springs are in <span class="smcap">Thee,</span>&rdquo; the sweet and
the bitter. 3.&nbsp;<i>Storms come from different
directions:</i> the family, the Church,
business, &amp;c. 4.&nbsp;<i>Storms are unpleasant
to bear.</i> The anxiety of the
sailor&rsquo;s wife. The traveller on the
moor. 5.&nbsp;<i>Storms leave their traces
behind.</i> The ravages of the sea. The
effects of gales on edifices. So in life.
The bereaved family. The capitalist
reduced to want, &amp;c. 6.&nbsp;But <i>storms
are beneficial</i> (Heb. xii.&nbsp;10, 11).</p>

<p><b>II. The storms of life are regulated
and controlled by God.</b> It is
of Him that our text speaks. Who
&ldquo;debates in measure?&rdquo; Who &ldquo;stayeth
His rough wind in the day of His
east wind?&rdquo; He who is almighty,
all-wise, and good. His greatness, as
shown in the firmament, hints that He
is too great to observe human beings.
But notice our Saviour&rsquo;s teaching:
while instructing us concerning His
Father, He speaks not of His omnipotence,
&amp;c., but of His observation of
small things (Matt. x.&nbsp;29, 30). Put a
green leaf or a drop of water under a
microscope, and you will see myriads
of living animalcules. God observes
every one. &ldquo;Casting all your care on
Him, for <i>He</i> careth for <i>you.</i>&rdquo; &ldquo;He&rdquo;
and &ldquo;you!&rdquo;</p>

<p><b>III. The storms of life are proportioned
to His people&rsquo;s strength.</b>
&ldquo;In measure.&rdquo; (See outlines <a href="#o236"><span class="smcap">The Afflictions of God&rsquo;s People</span></a>
and <a href="#o237"><span class="smcap">The Discipline of Sin,</span></a> pp. 290, 291.) A
Jew never exercised greater care and
exactitude in weighing out his gold
and diamonds than does God while
meting out trials to His people.
&ldquo;Grace to help in time of need;&rdquo; yea,
and storms equal to our strength.
We do not know how much our
strength is. One man over-estimates
his strength, another under-estimates
it. &ldquo;But He knoweth our frame.&rdquo;
&ldquo;God is faithful, who will not suffer
you to be tempted above that ye are
able&rdquo; (H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I. 179&ndash;188, 3675&ndash;3695).</p>

<p>In various ways He maintains the
merciful proportion of the storm to
the strength. 1.&nbsp;He does so sometimes
<i>by sending the lesser storms before
the greater.</i> Jacob at Bethel was unable
to undergo the trials of Jacob at
Mahanaim. By the time he reached
the latter place, he had become a
prince, an Israel. Carrying the least
burden prepares a man for carrying
the greatest (Hercules and the ox).
2.&nbsp;<i>Sometimes by sending the heaviest
first.</i> The man may then be in the
fulness of his vigour, or in spirit he
may be so contumacious that some
rough handling may be necessary to
bring his pride into subjection.
3.&nbsp;<i>By removing one trial before another
comes.</i> Poverty is taken away before
ill-health sets in. &ldquo;He stayeth His
rough wind.&rdquo; 4.&nbsp;<i>By sending each one
in its time.</i> &ldquo;It could not have come
at a worse time.&rdquo; Who says so?
&ldquo;If it had happened at another time,
it would have been easier to bear.&rdquo;
That may be so, but would it have
been as profitable? It was necessary
for you to <i>feel.</i> Less suffering would
not have sufficed for that end.</p>

<p><b>IV. The storms of life promote purposes
of wisdom and love.</b> 1.&nbsp;<i>The
Lord sometimes orders trials as chastisements.</i>
It is not always so; we are
too apt to explain everything as chastisement.
But God has promised to
correct (Jer. xxx.&nbsp;11), and it is the
promise of a father, not the threatening
<span class="pagenum" id="p482">[p.&nbsp;482]</span>
of a judge. (1.)&nbsp;Sometimes one
correction prevents many more.
(2.)&nbsp;When the Lord sends trials in the
way of correction, He graciously gives
His children the reasons for thus dealing
with them. &ldquo;The iniquity which
he <i>knoweth</i>&rdquo; (1&nbsp;Sam. iii.&nbsp;13). What
father would correct a child without
explaining to him what it was for?
And what correction would benefit the
saints while ignorant of the object in
view? Possibly the neighbours may
not know, but he has himself a private
account with God. Hence arises a
consequent duty (H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I. 144).
(3.)&nbsp;When God thus sends trials, they are
<i>corrections,</i> and not merely punishments;
manifestations not of vengeance,
but of His love. A gardener
uses the pruning-knife only for the
good of the fruit-bearing trees in his
garden. God&rsquo;s corrections are designed
only to take away the sin of
His people (see ver. 9, and Zech. xiii.&nbsp;9;
H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I. 56&ndash;74).</p>

<p>2. <i>The Lord sometimes orders trials
as exhibitions of the graces of His people.</i>
The tempest which beat upon Job
was not corrective, though he thought
so while it lasted (Job x.&nbsp;2, xiii.&nbsp;24).
The trial brought out into view his
trust in God: &ldquo;Though He slay me,
yet will I trust in Him.&rdquo; The Lord&rsquo;s
purpose was to prove that Job was &ldquo;a
perfect and an upright man&rdquo; (H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I.
91&ndash;98).</p>

<p>3. <i>Storms are sometimes preventive.</i> A
fiery trial is approaching; the man
is in danger, for he is too weak to
withstand it; by a lesser trial he is
withdrawn from it. Two ships are
drawing near in a fog; they are
making towards each other at a perfect
angle. The top-mast of one is
blown down; the men on deck bemoan
the misfortune; but it was the
means of slackening the pace of the
vessel, and so prevented a collision.
A man is sometimes laid on a bed of
sickness to save his life&mdash;to save his
soul!</p>

<p>4. <i>Storms sometimes prepare men for
nobler work.</i> Moses, after being brought
up in the lap of luxury, is watching
the flock forty years in Midian. All
the learning of Egypt is lost in a shepherd.
Nay! Moses requires a double
education, for he has a duplicate work
to perform&mdash;appearing before Pharaoh
in the palace, and leading Israel
through the wilderness. <i>E.g.,</i> what
good can a preacher do, if he has no
<i>experience</i> of his own? (Ps. li.&nbsp;12, 13;
2&nbsp;Cor. i.&nbsp;3&ndash;6; H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I. 101&ndash;108, 2464,
2465).</p>

<p>Some one may say that he has no
knowledge of storms from experience.
Wait! Peradventure thou shalt
know. Should they come, <i>bow.</i>
Nothing breaks, if it bends.&mdash;<i>Gweithiau
Rhyddieithol,</i> pp. 78&ndash;81, <i>by the

in bondage. When the slaves of
America were liberated, the bondmen
in Cuba, Peru, &amp;c., were not set free.
But here is a blessing for the whole
world. &ldquo;Which shall be to all people,&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
a light to lighten the Gentiles&rdquo;
(Luke ii.&nbsp;10, 32). One side of the
earth can only enjoy the rays of the
sun at the same time; but this &ldquo;light&rdquo;
shall shed its rays on the whole world.
2.&nbsp;<i>It is designed for the world in its most
important interests.</i> There are inventions
and scientific discoveries&mdash;such
as the steam-engine, &amp;c.&mdash;which are
valuable to the whole world. But
they are valuable only in regard to the
present life. But the Gospel meets
the wants of the soul, and concerns
<span class="pagenum" id="p483">[p.&nbsp;483]</span>
the endless life beyond. 3.&nbsp;<i>It is so
great that all other things in the world
are small in comparison with it;</i> trade,
learning, &amp;c. 4.&nbsp;<i>It is so great that it
bestows greatness upon everything it
touches.</i> Upon oratory, although it is
independent of excellency of speech.
Upon any country in which it is proclaimed
and accepted; <i>e.g.,</i> Great
Britain, America. Under its shelter
liberty, learning, &amp;c., flourish (H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I.
1124&ndash;1132).</p>

<p>II. <span class="smcap">The ministry of the Gospel.</span>
&ldquo;The great trumpet shall be blown.&rdquo;
What is the good of a trumpet without
some one to blow it? (Rom. x.&nbsp;14).</p>

<p><b>1. Who is to blow it?</b> Not angels
(Heb. ii.&nbsp;5). The law was given by
the ministry of angels; by them the
trumpet was blown on Mount Sinai
(Acts vii.&nbsp;53). But they recognise
that the trumpet of the Gospel is to
be blown by <i>men</i> (Acts v.&nbsp;20, x.&nbsp;31, 32).
This treasure is in earthen
vessels. Gideon&rsquo;s Lamps. Men are
better than angels for this purpose.
This is proved by the fact that God
ordered it so. But there are other
minor satisfactory arguments, such as:
(1.)&nbsp;<i>The danger of glorifying the missionary
above the mission.</i> (2.)&nbsp;<i>The
angels&rsquo; disadvantages.</i> They lack the
necessary experience. Blessed lack,
in all other respects! They have
never been contaminated by sin, and
hence know not how to speak to the
heart of the sinner. By men the
trumpet is now being blown, and will
be blown to the end of time. The
trumpeters are falling, ministers are
dying, but the ministry is alive!</p>

<p><b>2. How is it to be blown?</b>
(1.)&nbsp;<i>Clearly</i> (1&nbsp;Cor. xiv.&nbsp;8). If the promises
are proclaimed, care must be
taken to show to whom they belong.
So with the threatenings, &amp;c.
(2.)&nbsp;<i>Vigorously.</i> It must be done thoroughly,
or not at all. (3.)&nbsp;<i>Bravely</i>
(Eph. vi.&nbsp;19). The question is not
what will &ldquo;take,&rdquo; what is popular,
what would please the masses, but
&ldquo;What saith the Lord?&rdquo;</p>

<p>III. <span class="smcap">The objects of the ministry.</span>
&ldquo;They which were ready to perish.&rdquo;
1.&nbsp;<i>Pagans are such</i> (Rom. i.) &ldquo;Them which
sat in the region and shadow of death&rdquo;
(Matt. iv.&nbsp;16). 2.&nbsp;<i>Every unconverted
sinner.</i> They are all to be addressed
as those who are &ldquo;ready to perish.&rdquo;
The matter cannot be compromised
because there are seat-holders, contributors,
&amp;c. Your kindness shall
not prevent our blowing from the trumpet
the tones you need to hear.</p>

<p>IV. <span class="smcap">The success of the Gospel.</span>
&ldquo;And they shall come which were
ready to perish in the land of Assyria,
and the outcasts in the land of Egypt,
and shall worship the Lord in the
holy mount at Jerusalem.&rdquo; 1.&nbsp;<i>Whence
shall they come?</i> From the Pharisaical
hiding-places, the quicksands
of excuses, &amp;c. They are bound in
the chains of slavery; but &ldquo;they
shall come!&rdquo; This is as certain as
the deliverance from Babylon. Take
us your harps and strike them!
2.&nbsp;<i>How will they come?</i> Weeping.
Without delay. Confidently.
3.&nbsp;<i>Whither and to whom will they come?</i>
(1.)&nbsp;To Christ; they cannot live without
Him. (2.)&nbsp;To His house.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Applications.</span>&mdash;1.&nbsp;Thousands have

<h3 class="tdc" id="o360"><span class="smcap">Rejecters of the Gospel Admonished.</span></h3>

<p class="bq">xxviii.&nbsp;12. <i>To whom He said, This is the rest wherewith ye may cause the weary to
rest; and this is the refreshing: yet they would not hear.</i></p>

<p>Isaiah was one of the most eloquent
of preachers, yet he could not win the
ears and hearts of those to whom he
spoke. He spoke more of Jesus Christ
than all the rest of the prophets, yet
the message of love was treated as
though it were an idle tale. His doctrine
was clear as the daylight, yet
men would not see it (chap. liii.&nbsp;1).
It was not the fault of the preacher
<span class="pagenum" id="p484">[p.&nbsp;484]</span>
that Israel rejected his warnings: all
the fault lay with the disobedient and
gainsaying nation. The people to
whom he spoke so earnestly were
drunken in a double sense:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. They were overcome with wine
(vers. 7, 8). How is it likely that the
truth shall enter an ear which has been
rendered deaf by this degrading vice?
How is the Word of God likely to
operate upon a conscience that has
been drenched and drowned by strong
drink? Flee from this destroyer before
your hands are made strong and
you are hopelessly fettered by the
habit.</p>

<p>2. They were also intoxicated with
pride. Their country was fruitful,
and its chief city, Samaria, stood on
the hill-top, like a diadem of beauty
crowning the land, and they delighted
in it. Among them were many
champions whose strength sufficed to
turn the battle to the gate, therefore
they hoped to resist every invader,
and so their hearts were lifted up.
Moreover, they said, &ldquo;We are an
intelligent people; we are men of
cultured intellect, instructed scribes,
and we do not need persons like Isaiah
to weary us with the ding-dong of
&lsquo;precept upon precept, line upon line,&rsquo;
as if we were mere children at school.
Besides, we are good enough. Do we
not worship our God under the form of
the golden calves in Dan and Bethel?
Do we not respect the sacrifice and the
holy days?&rdquo; So spoke the more religious
of them, while the rest gloried
in their shame. Being intoxicated
with pride, it was not likely that they
would hear the message of the prophet
who made them turn from their evil
ways. Pride is the devil&rsquo;s drag-net, in
which he taketh more fishes than in
any other, except procrastination.</p>

<p>The two forms of drunkenness are
equally destructive. Whether body
or soul be intoxicated, mischief will
surely come of it. Let us not get
drunk with pride because we are not
drunkards; for if we are so vain and
foolish, we shall as certainly perish by
pride as we should have done by
drink.</p>

<p>I. <span class="smcap">The excellence of the Gospel</span>
as it is set forth in the passage
before us. This Scripture does not
allude to the Gospel primarily, but to
the message which Isaiah had to deliver,
which was in part the command
of the law and in part the promise
of grace: but the same rule holds
good of all the words of the Lord;
and indeed any excellence which was
found in the prophet&rsquo;s message is found
yet more abundantly in the fuller testimony
of the Gospel in Christ Jesus.</p>

<p><b>1. The excellence of that Gospel
lies, first in its object.</b> For</p>

<p>(1.) <i>It is a revelation of rest.</i> Christ&rsquo;s
ambassadors are sent to proclaim to you
that which shall give you ease, peace,
quiet, rest. It is true that we have to begin
with certain truths that disturb and distress;
but our object is to dig out the
foundation into which may be laid the
stones of restfulness. The object
of the Gospel is not to make men anxious,
but to calm their anxieties; not to fill
them with endless controversy, but to
lead them into all truth. The Gospel
gives rest of conscience, by the complete
forgiveness of sin through the
atoning blood of Christ; rest of heart,
by supplying an object for the affections
worthy of their love; and rest
of intellect, by teaching it certainties
which can be accepted without question.
Our message does not consist of
things guessed at by wit, nor evolved
out of men&rsquo;s inner consciousness by
study, not developed by argument
through human reason; but it treats
of revealed certainties, absolutely and
infallibly true, upon which the understanding
may rest itself as thoroughly
as a building rests upon a foundation
of rock. The Word of the Lord comes
to give believing men rest about the
present by telling them that God
ordereth all things for their good;
and as for the future, it brightens all
coming time and eternity with promises.
The man who will hear the
Gospel message, and receive it into his
soul, shall know the peace of God,
which passeth all understanding,
and shall keep his heart and mind by
Jesus Christ.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="p485">[p.&nbsp;485]</span>
(2.) <i>It is the cause of rest.</i> &ldquo;This is
the rest wherewith ye may <i>cause</i> the
weary to rest.&rdquo; The Gospel of our
salvation is not only a command to
rest, but it brings the gift of rest
within itself. Let the Gospel be admitted
into the heart, and it will
create a profound calm, hushing all
the tumult and strife of conscience,
removing all apprehensions of Divine
wrath, stilling all rebellion against the
supreme Will, and so working in the
spirit by the energy of the Holy Ghost
a deep and blessed peace.</p>

<p>(3.) <i>This rest is especially meant for
the weary.</i> &ldquo;This is the rest wherewith
ye may cause the weary to rest.&rdquo;
Oh, ye that are weary with the round
of worldly pleasure, worn with ambition,
fretted with disappointment, embittered
by the faithlessness of those
you trusted in, come and confide in
Jesus and be at rest. Here is the
rest, here is the refreshing. Jesus
expressly puts it: &ldquo;Come unto me, all
ye that labour and are heavy laden,
and I will give you rest.&rdquo; Despondent
and despairing, condemned, and in
your conscience cast out to the
gates of hell, yet look to Jesus and
rest shall be yours.</p>

<p>(4.) In addition to bringing us rest,
<i>the message of mercy points to a refreshing.</i>
&ldquo;This is the rest wherewith
ye may cause the weary to rest; and
this is the refreshing.&rdquo; If the rested
one should grow weary again, the
Good Shepherd will give him refreshing;
if he wanders, the Lord will
restore him; yea, He has begun
His gracious work of renewing, and
He will continue it by renewing the
heart from day to day, blending the
will with His own, and making the
whole man more and more to rejoice
in Him.</p>

<p>Now, note with peculiar joy that
Isaiah did not come to these people
to talk about rest in dubious terms,
and say, &ldquo;There is no doubt a rest to
be found somewhere in that goodness
of God of which it is reasonable to
conjecture.&rdquo; No; he puts his finger
right down on the truth, and he says,
&ldquo;<i>This is</i> the rest, and <i>this is</i> the refreshing.&rdquo;
Even so we at this day,
when we come to you with a message
from God, come <i>with definite teaching;</i>
we proclaim in the name of God that
whosoever believeth in Christ Jesus
hath everlasting life: this is the rest,
and this is the refreshing.</p>

<p><i>Nor did he preach a rest of a selfish
character.</i> They say we teach men to
get peace and rest for themselves, and
make themselves comfortable, whatever
becomes of others. They know
better, and they forge these falsehoods
because their heart is false. Are we
not always bidding men look out from
themselves, and love others even as
Christ has loved them? We abhor
the idea that personal safety is the
consummation of a religious man&rsquo;s
desires, for we believe that the life of
grace is the death of selfishness. This
is one of the glories of the Gospel,
that &ldquo;this is the rest wherewith ye
may cause the weary to rest.&rdquo; Get
rest yourself, and you will soon cause
other weary minds to rest. That
secret something which your own
heart possesses shall enable you to
communicate good cheer to many a
weary heart, and hope to many a
desponding mind.</p>

<p><b>2. The other excellence of the
Gospel of which I shall speak at this
time lies in its manner.</b></p>

<p>(1.) <i>It comes with authority.</i> The
Gospel does not pretend to be a speculative
scheme or a theory of philosophy
which will suit the nineteenth century,
but will be exploded in the twentieth.
No; it comes to men as a message
from God, and he that speaks it aright
does not speak it as a thinker uttering
his own thoughts; but he utters what
he has learned, and acts as God&rsquo;s
tongue, repeating what he finds in
God&rsquo;s Word by the power of God&rsquo;s
Spirit.</p>

<p>(2.) <i>It was delivered with great simplicity.</i>
Isaiah came with it &ldquo;precept
upon precept, line upon line, here a
little and there a little.&rdquo; It is the
glory of the Gospel that is so plain.
If it were so profound that we must
take a degree at a university before
<span class="pagenum" id="p486">[p.&nbsp;486]</span>
we could comprehend it, what a miserable
Gospel it would be for mocking
the world with! But it is Divinely
sublime in its simplicity, and hence
the common people hear it gladly. As
the verse seems to imply, it is fitted
for those who are weaned from the
breast; those who are little more than
babes may yet drink in this unadulterated
milk of the Word. Many a
little child has comprehended the
salvation of Jesus Christ sufficiently
to rejoice in it. I bless God for a
simple Gospel, for it suits me, and
thousands of others whose minds cannot
boast of greatness or genius. It
equally suits men of intellect, and it
is only quarrelled with by pretenders.
A man who really has a capacious
mind is usually childlike, and, like Sir
Isaac Newton, is glad to sit at Jesus&rsquo;
feet. Great minds love the simple
Gospel of God, for they find rest in it
from all the worry and the weariness
of questions and of doubts.</p>

<p>(3.) <i>It is taught us by degrees.</i> It is
not forced home upon men&rsquo;s minds all
at once, but it comes &ldquo;precept upon
precept, line upon line, here a little
and there a little.&rdquo; God does not
flash the everlasting daylight on weak
eyes in one blaze of glory, but there is
at first a dim dawn, and the soft incoming
of a tender light for tender
eyes, and so by degrees we see.</p>

<p>(4.) <i>The Gospel is repeated.</i> If we do
see it at once, it comes again to us, for
it is &ldquo;precept upon precept, line upon
line, here a little and there a little.&rdquo;
From morning to morning, from Sunday
to Sunday, book after book,
by text after text, by spiritual impression
after spiritual impression, the
Divine gentleness makes us wise unto
salvation.</p>

<p>(5.) <i>It is brought home to us in ways
suitable to our capacity.</i> It is told to
us, as it were, with stammering lips
(see ver. 11), just as mothers teach
their little children in a language all
their own. In much of the Bible,
especially in the Old Testament, God
condescends to lay aside His own
speech and talk the language of men.
He bows to us and tells us His mind
in types and ordinances, which are a
sort of child-language fitted to our
capacity. If you do not understand
the Word of God, it is not because He
does not put it plainly, but because
of the blindness of your heart and
the besotted condition of your spirit.
Take heed that you are not drunken
with the wine of pride, but be willing
to learn; for God Himself hath not
darkened counsel by mysterious words,
but He has put His mind before you
as plainly as the sun in the heavens.
&ldquo;Precept upon precept, line upon
line, here a little and there a little.&rdquo;</p>

<p>II. <span class="smcap">The objections which are
taken to the Gospel.</span></p>

<p>1. They are most <i>wanton.</i> Men object
to that which promises them rest!
Above all the things in the world this
is what our troubled spirits need. Oh,
the intense folly of men, that when
the Gospel sets rest before them they
will not hear it, but turn upon their
heel. There is no system of doctrine
under heaven that can give quiet to
the conscience of men, quiet that is
worth having, except the Gospel; and
there are thousands of us who bear
witness that we live in the daily
enjoyment of peace through believing
in Jesus, and yet our honest report is
not believed; nay, they will not hear
the truth.</p>

<p>2. Objections against the Gospel are
<i>wilful,</i> even as it is here said, &ldquo;This
is the refreshing, yet they would not
hear.&rdquo; When man say they cannot
believe the Gospel, ask them whether
they will patiently hear it in all its
simplicity. No, they say, they do not
want to hear it. The Gospel is so
difficult to believe; so they say. Will
they come and hear it preached in its
fulness? Will they read the Gospels
for themselves carefully? Oh, no;
they cannot take the trouble. Just
so. But a man who does not want to
be convinced must not blame anybody
if he remains in error, nor wonder
that objections swarm in his mind.</p>

<p>3. Such objections are <i>wicked,</i> because
they are rebellion against God
and an insult to His truth and mercy.
If this Gospel be of God, I am bound
<span class="pagenum" id="p487">[p.&nbsp;487]</span>
to receive it: I have no right to cavil
at it, nor raise questions, philosophical
or otherwise. It is mine just to say,
&ldquo;Does God say this and that? Then
it is true, and I yield to it. Does
the Lord thus set before me a way of
salvation? I will run in it with
delight.&rdquo;</p>

<p>4. These people raised objections
that were <i>the outgrowth of their pride.</i>
They objected to the simplicity of
Isaiah&rsquo;s preaching. They said, &ldquo;Who
is he? You should not go to hear
him; he talks to us as if we were
children. Besides, it is the same
thing over and over again. You may
go when you like, he is always harping
on the same string.&rdquo; Have you
not heard folks say in these days concerning
a true Gospel preacher, that
he is always preaching about sovereign
grace, or the blood of Christ, or
crying out, &ldquo;Believe, believe, and you
shall be saved&rdquo;? They sneer and say,
&ldquo;It is the old ditty over and over
again.&rdquo; The passage translated &ldquo;precept
upon precept, line upon line,&rdquo;
was uttered in ridicule, and sounded
like a ding-dong rhyme with which
they mocked Isaiah. The words
were intended to caricature the
preacher; though they do not suggest
the idea when translated, they do
suggest it readily enough in the Hebrew.
There are people now living
who, when the Gospel is plainly and
simply preached, exclaim, &ldquo;We want
progressive thought; we want&rdquo;&mdash;they
do not quite know what they do
want. Too many wish for a map to
heaven so mysteriously drawn that
they may be excused from following
it. Multitudes prefer the Gospel
shrouded in a mist; they love to see
the wisdom of man shut out the wisdom
of God. This was the style of
objection current in Israel&rsquo;s day, and
it is fashionable still.</p>

<p>III. <span class="smcap">The Divine requital of
these objectors.</span></p>

<p>1. The Lord threatens them <i>with
the loss of that which they despised.</i> He
has sent them a message of rest and
they will not have it, and therefore in
the 20th verse He warns them that
they shall have no rest henceforth:
&ldquo;For the bed is shorter than that a
man can stretch himself on it; and
the covering narrower than that he
can wrap himself in it.&rdquo; All those
who wilfully reject the Gospel and
take up with philosophies and speculations
will be rewarded with inward
discontent. Ask the preachers of that
kind of doctrine whether they themselves
have found an anchorage, and
as a rule they will answer, &ldquo;No, no;
we are in pursuit of truth; we are
hunting after it, but we have not
reached it yet.&rdquo; They are never
likely to reach it, for they are on the
wrong track. The Gospel was made
to rest conscience, soul, heart will,
memory, hope, fear, yes, the entire
man; but when men laugh at all fixity
of belief, how can they be rested?
This is the condemnation of the unbeliever,
that he shall never find a
settlement, but, like the wandering
Jew, shall roam for ever. Leave the
Cross, and you have left the hinge of
all things, and neglected the one sure
corner-stone and fixed foundation,
and henceforth you shall be as a rolling
thing before the whirlwind.</p>

<p>2. <i>They shall be punished by a gradual
hardening of heart.</i> They said that
Isaiah&rsquo;s message was &ldquo;precept upon
precept, line upon line, here a little
and there a little,&rdquo; and justice answers
them, &ldquo;Even so it shall be to you a
thing despised and ridiculed, so that
you will go farther away from it; you
will fall backward and be broken,
and snared and taken&rdquo; (ver. 13). A
fall backward is the worst kind of
fall. If a man falls forward, he may
somewhat save himself and rise again;
but if he falls backward, he falls with
all his weight and is helpless. Those
who stumble at Christ, the sure
foundation-stone, shall be broken.
When oppressors hope to retrieve their
position, they find themselves snared
by their habits, entangled in the net
of the great fowler, and taken by the
destroyer. This downward course is
followed full often by those who
begin cavilling at the simple Gospel;
they cavil more and more, and become
<span class="pagenum" id="p488">[p.&nbsp;488]</span>
its open enemies to their eternal
ruin.</p>

<p>3. This is to be followed by <i>a growing
inability to understand.</i> &ldquo;For with
stammering lips and another tongue
will He speak to this people.&rdquo; Since
they would not hear plain speech,
God will make simplicity itself to
seem like stammering to them. Men
that cannot endure simple language
shall at last become unable to understand
it. If men will not understand,
they shall not understand. A man
may shut his eyes so long that he
cannot open them. In India many
devotees have held up their arms so
long that they can never take them
down again. Beware lest an utter
imbecility of heart come upon those
of you who refuse the Gospel.</p>

<p>Lastly, this warning is given to
those who object to the Gospel, that
<i>whatever refuge they choose for themselves
shall utterly fail them.</i> Thus saith the
Lord, &ldquo;Judgment will I also lay to
the line, and righteousness to the
plummet: and the hail shall sweep
away the refuge of lies, and the waters
shall overflow the hiding-place.&rdquo;
Down come the great hailstones dashing
everything to shivers, the threatenings
of God&rsquo;s Word breaking to
pieces all the false and flattering
hopes of the ungodly. Then comes
the active wrath of God like an overwhelming
flood to sweep away everything
on which the sinner stood, and
he, in his obstinate unbelief, is carried
away as with a flood into that utter
destruction, that everlasting misery,
which God has declared shall be the
lot of all those who refuse the living
Christ.&mdash;<i>C.&nbsp;H. Spurgeon: Metropolitan
Tabernacle Pulpit,</i> No. 1593.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 class="tdc" id="o361"><span class="smcap">False Refuges.</span></h3>

<p class="bq">xxviii.&nbsp;18. <i>Your covenant with death shall be disannulled.</i></p>

<p>Like the sinners spoken of in this
chapter, most sinful men say in effect,
&ldquo;We have made a covenant with
death,&rdquo; &amp;c. (ver. 15).</p>

<p><b>I. That he may escape the dreaded
consequences of sin, the troubled sinner
seeks a refuge.</b> He flees&mdash;1.&nbsp;<i>From
the voice of reason.</i> The presence of a
reasoning power in man is incompatible
with the practice of sin. This is seen
in the fact that when sinners can be
brought to think, they at once admit
themselves to be wrong. The moment
a man commences to think about sin,
that moment he becomes aware that
it will not bear thinking about. It is
because a sinful life is an unthinking
life that God&rsquo;s invitations to sinners
are invitations to reason (chap. i.&nbsp;18;
Ps. l.&nbsp;22&ndash;23). 2.&nbsp;<i>From an accusing conscience.</i>
The authority of conscience
is supreme, and no man can sin without
feeling its sting. To escape remorse,
which is conscience at work,
men seek a refuge. 3.&nbsp;<i>From an
offended God.</i> Sin is offensive to God&rsquo;s
holiness; for being pure, He must hate
impurity. Because sinners are conscious
that they have rendered themselves
obnoxious to God, they seek a
refuge. 4.&nbsp;<i>From a broken law.</i> In
obedience to law there is safety, right,
and happiness; while in disregarding
law there is nothing but disaster. And
from the consequences of the broken
law&mdash;the broken law of God written
on the heart, proclaimed in Nature,
revealed in the Bible&mdash;the sinner tries
to hide. 5.&nbsp;<i>From an endless future.</i>
This more than anything else terrifies
sinners and drives them to seek shelter.</p>

<p><b>II. Sinners, blindly infatuated, seek
a refuge in the wrong objects.</b> They
make a covenant with death and an
agreement with hell. The terms
&ldquo;death&rdquo; and &ldquo;hell&rdquo; stand for the
whole class of false securities in which
men seek shelter by making a covenant
and agreement with them. 1.&nbsp;<i>Unbelief</i> is
one of the most modern refuges of sin.
When men can blot out of the universe
the idea of God, quench the sense of
moral responsibility, remove the belief
in immortality, persuade themselves
that there is no other world, that death
<span class="pagenum" id="p489">[p.&nbsp;489]</span>
is an eternal sleep, that heaven is only
an air-castle, and hell a mere chimera,
they may then indulge in evil to
their hearts&rsquo; content. 2.&nbsp;<i>Superstition</i>
is another. Not in open unbelief, but
under the cover of a false religion
others seek to shelter. Unable to
shake off belief in God and in a
spiritual world, they search for some
system which will at once allow a
profession of religion and a practice
of wickedness. Nor are such systems
wanting, nor are they without disciples.
Romanism offers indulgences
for gold and pardons for peace,
and thus provides a refuge for the
stronger in pocket than in brain.
3.&nbsp;<i>Annihilation</i> is another. According to
some, such is the awfulness of the
thought of extinction of being, that
men revolt from it. Establish it that
when sinners die they cease to live,
and what better refuge for sin is
possible, and what other is needed?
Sinful men will soon say, &ldquo;Let us eat
and drink, for to-morrow we die.&rdquo;
4.&nbsp;<i>Excess</i> is another. When the previous
ones have failed to give comfort, the
sinner rushes madly into excess. The
drunkard seeks in increased intemperance
to drown the sorrow his
indulgence has occasioned. 5.&nbsp;<i>Indifference</i>
is the last. This is the only
comfort some men can find in their
career of evil. But indifference is
impossible without a denial of human
responsibility. Sad indeed must the
condition of human nature be when
brought to this.</p>

<p><b>III. The refuges so confidently
trusted in are utterly insecure.</b>
1.&nbsp;<i>Because they are incompatible with the
real need of man.</i> Only that can be
conducive to man&rsquo;s safety which meets
man&rsquo;s need. No human need is met
by infidelity, or by superstition, or by
annihilation, or by indulgence, or by
indifference. Any one of these, tested
by this argument drawn from human
necessities, will be found a refuge of
lies. 2.&nbsp;<i>Because they are at variance
with human instincts.</i> Instinctively men
believe in a Divine existence, in moral
accountability, and in immortality.
3.&nbsp;<i>Because they contradict human experience.</i>
They have all been tried, and as often
as they have been tried they have been
found false. 4.&nbsp;<i>Because they are opposed
to the teaching of revelation, both
natural and Biblical.</i> Nature proclaims
loudly against all sin-sought refuges.
The teaching of Nature and the Bible
is that man is incompetent to provide
for his own security, and that God
only, in the exercise of His Divine
prerogative, can provide for sinners
the security they need.</p>

<p><b>IV. By Divine appointment the
refuges so madly sought shall be
totally destroyed.</b> &ldquo;Your covenant
with death shall be disannulled.&rdquo;
1.&nbsp;<i>By consequence of their inherent character.</i>
They are &ldquo;refuges of lies,&rdquo; and
necessarily all refuges built on lies
must perish. 2.&nbsp;<i>By necessity of strict
justice.</i> &ldquo;Judgment will I lay to the
line, and righteousness to the plummet&rdquo;
(ver. 17). 3.&nbsp;<i>By the exertion of
Almighty power.</i> &ldquo;And the hail shall
sweep away the refuge of lies, and the
waters shall overflow the hiding-place.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Conclusion.</span>&mdash;God has mercifully
provided a true refuge. He only cuts
off the false that He may exhibit the
true. &ldquo;Behold, I lay in Sion for a
foundation a stone,&rdquo; &amp;c. (ver. 16).&mdash;<i>William
Brooks: Study and the Pulpit,</i>

<h3 class="tdc" id="o362"><span class="smcap">Some Aspects of Ministerial Duty.</span></h3>

<p class="bq">xxx.&nbsp;7. <i>Therefore have I cried concerning this, Their strength is to sit still.</i></p>

<p>Jerusalem and Judah were threatened
by Sennacherib with dangers
and desolations. This people&rsquo;s sin,
for which they were reproved by
Isaiah, was their trusting to the Egyptians;
they were all in a hurry to obtain
help from them, without seeking
counsel of God and resting upon Him.
Isaiah saw that the help of the Egyptians
would be worthless to them, and
<span class="pagenum" id="p490">[p.&nbsp;490]</span>
therefore he counselled them to &ldquo;sit
still,&rdquo; trusting in the power, providence,
and promise of God, from
whom too much cannot be expected.</p>

<p><b>I. Notice the prophet&rsquo;s intermeddling
in this important matter.</b> He
publishes God&rsquo;s mind concerning it.
It is the duty of ministers to meddle
sometimes in public matters, whether
in Church or State; they are to show
Jacob their sins, and Israel their
transgressions. This is a part of
ministers&rsquo; work, to testify against sin
in all. Christ was the light of the
<i>world;</i> and they should be like their
Master, testifying against all works of
darkness. True, the world quarrels
with the servants of God because
they bear testimony against its sins;
and on this account many ministers
who have some light, put their light in
prison: &ldquo;They hold the truth in unrighteousness.&rdquo;
They do this by not
bearing witness against public wrongs,
and the sin and defection of statesmen.
But it was a gracious expression
of a graceless Cain, &ldquo;Am I my
brother&rsquo;s keeper?&rdquo; &ldquo;What am I concerned
with the souls or the sins of
others? What am I concerned with
the public evils of the day I live in?&rdquo;
True religion begins at home, but it
does not end there; it will come
without doors with us (H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I.
1184&ndash;1186).</p>

<p><b>II. Observe the manner of the
prophet&rsquo;s address to this people.</b>
&ldquo;Therefore have I <i>cried</i> concerning
this.&rdquo; It is the duty of ministers to
be earnest and zealous in reproving
sin and reclaiming sinners. They are
to be both seers and criers; and when
they see any danger, they should <span class="smcap">cry,</span>
that the people may hear and flee out
of harm&rsquo;s way.</p>

<p>1. This is true in regard to public
wrongs and national projects which
are contrary to the Will of God (P.&nbsp;D.
2855).</p>

<p>2. They need to <i>cry</i> about matters
of eternity, that people may secure
something that death may not be able
to take from them&mdash;such as these:
saving knowledge, saving faith, pardon
of sin, evangelical love of God in
Christ, faithful labours for the honour
and glory of God.&mdash;<i>Ralph Erskine,
A.&nbsp;M.: Sermons,</i> vol. ii. pp. 252, 253.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 class="tdc" id="o363"><span class="smcap">Growing Light.</span></h3>

<p class="bq">xxx.&nbsp;26. <i>Moreover, the light of the moon, &amp;c.</i></p>

<p>These words, doubtless, look forward
to the restoration of Israel. But
there are spiritual truths implied in
them, which are of present and immediate
application. We have here
different <i>kinds</i> of light; different <i>degrees</i>
of the same light; and also the
<i>seasons</i> which such increase of light is
vouchsafed.</p>

<p>I. <span class="smcap">The light of the moon.</span> It is
a real light, but it is reflected light.
It does not come to us direct from the
sun, but is thrown first upon the moon,
and from her it comes to us. Hence
its peculiarities. It is a dim light;
it does not warm and quicken; it does
not make things grow and vegetate.
It is a waning light; sometimes it is
full, but it soon begins to decline, and
for a season it is wholly withdrawn.
It is a light which never makes day;
even at its fullest, it is still night;
men occasionally walk and work in
it, but usually they rest and sleep.</p>

<p>Why do I notice these things, which
are obvious to all on a moment&rsquo;s reflection?
Because I believe there is
important Divine truth hidden under
them. All Nature is a prefiguring or
shadowing forth of grace and truth
(H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I. 5, 6).</p>

<p>We have been describing the religious
knowledge of not a few. It is
moonlight; it does not come to them
direct from Christ, the Sun of Righteousness,
the Source of all true light;
it is hearsay; they have learned it from
their fellow-men. It is not experimental,
and hence its deficiencies. It
is a vague, dim knowledge; they see
nothing clearly, neither sin nor salvation,
neither Christ nor themselves,
<span class="pagenum" id="p491">[p.&nbsp;491]</span>
neither law nor gospel, neither grace
nor glory. It is a cold, heartless
knowledge; it does not warm, quicken,
stir their affections, influence their
wills. It is a waning knowledge;
sometimes they seem full of it&mdash;after a
stirring sermon, or when they are in
the company of frank, lively Christians&mdash;but
a short time passes and it
is all gone, as if it had never been. It
never makes them children of the day,
it never arouses them from the sleep
of sin and worldliness, nor sends
them forth to work for God and for
eternity.</p>

<p>Such is this moonlight knowledge.
Still it would be something if it led
those who have it to Christ, the true
Light. The people of Sychar had the
moonlight when the woman on whom
the Sun had just arisen came and cast
a portion of her light upon them. But
they did not rest on this; they went
out of the city and saw and heard for
themselves, and so many believed and
were saved. But this is what many
fail to do in revival times. The Lord
has visited His people, and refreshed
and saved them; and others speak
freely of the good they have received,
sing gladly their new songs, and are
for the time stirred and affected. But
it is only moonlight; they have never
come to Him who changes not; and so
when the warmth and stir of the revival
passes they fall back, and perhaps
become worse than before. Not
a few are still in the moonlight, and
are satisfied with it. You hear about
Christ, perhaps can talk about Him,
but this is not salvation (H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I.
3148).</p>

<p>II. <span class="smcap">The light of the sun.</span> This
comes immediately from the sun, and
hence its excellence. It is a clear,
bright light, and so things afar off and
near at hand are distinctly seen. It is
a warm light; there is heat in it; it
thaws and chases away the winter;
it makes spring and summer; it causes
all things to grow and vegetate. It is
an awakening light; it makes day, and
men arise and go to their work, and
wild creatures and evil-doers retire.
It is a constant light. The sun never
waxes or wanes; he is ever the same.
True, there are wintry days, dark,
dreary days, but still the sun is there,
shining through the clouds, and shining
them away, and soon breaking
forth again in his glory. Is this the
character of your religious knowledge?
[Work out the details of the comparison.]</p>

<p>III. <span class="smcap">Different degrees of light.</span>
&ldquo;The light of the sun shall be sevenfold,
as the light of seven days.&rdquo; Here
there is only a change of degree.
There is no new luminary; it is still
the sun, but it is far more intense and
continuous. We can conceive what
would be the effect of this in the
natural world. Things now invisible
from their minuteness or indistinctly
seen from their distance would
then be clearly revealed, and fruits
and flowers which cannot at present be
reared in our climate would then be
common and indigenous among us.
There can be a sevenfold Divine light
and Divine warmth. Christ has it to
give. He will one day give it to all
His people, and the weak shall be as
David, and David as the angel of the
Lord. Even now He grants it to
those who seek Him with the whole
heart. The patriarchs, prophets,
apostles had it. Nor are these peculiar,
exceptional cases. I believe
there is more of it than we are aware
of and probably there would be more
if we did not straighten and hinder
the Lord by our want of desire and
expectation.</p>

<p>IV. <span class="smcap">The times when this blessing
is vouchsafed.</span> &ldquo;In the day that the
Lord bindeth up the breach of His
people, and healeth the stroke of their
wound.&rdquo; This evidently looks forward
to the time when the long alienation
between Israel and their God will be
healed. But is He the God of the
Jews only? Nay, of the Gentiles also.
There are two opposite errors into
which men fall on the reading of these
promises. Some see only the Jew in
them; others do not see the Jew in
them at all. But there is room for
both in these green pastures. Even
now there are fulfilments of this promise
<span class="pagenum" id="p492">[p.&nbsp;492]</span>
in its truest, highest sense. Even
now the light of the moon becomes as
the light of the sun, and the light of
the sun as that of seven days. It is
so, for instance, often at conversion;
it is a passing from darkness into
marvellous light. It is often so when
the backslider returns. Look at David
in the 51st Psalm, what light he
has got! It is so often in times of
sore affliction. Then the exceeding
great and precious promises come out
into view, as darkness shows us
worlds of light we never saw by day
(Ps. xciv.&nbsp;12). It is so at death, when
the soul leaves its cage and soars away
into heavenly light and liberty. It
will be so when the Lord comes on the
resurrection morn. And once more,
oh! the light there will be when the
Lamb opens the books and makes
every mystery plain! (H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I. 3127,
3128).&mdash;<i>John Milne: Gatherings from a
Ministry,</i> pp. 114&ndash;122.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 class="tdc" id="o364"><span class="smcap">Nobility and Security.</span></h3>

<p class="bq">xxxiii.&nbsp;15, 16. <i>He that walketh righteously, &amp;c.</i></p>

<p>These were terrible times in Jerusalem.
The Assyrian power was exceedingly
formidable; it was as ferocious
as it was strong. The Assyrian had
come up into the land, yet God had
given a promise to His people that
they should be preserved (chap. xxxvii.&nbsp;33, 34).
Some in the city rested content
with the promise of God, and
went about their daily business feeling
perfectly safe. But there were a few
such. A great number were afraid
they would be destroyed&mdash;they were
sure of it. Who was to save them, or
what power could stand in the way of
Sennacherib? These were the sinners
and hypocrites, and the time of trial
developed them. They could not live,
they said; the land was smoking, for
the Assyrian had set everything on
fire. Some who dwell among God&rsquo;s
people are sinners and not saints,
hypocrites and not believers. When
all goes well with the Church of God
you cannot detect the difference. But
when the time of trial comes, the
hypocrites and sinners will be discovered
by their own fear. Let us
not be satisfied with being in Zion&mdash;in
the Church; let us not rest till we
are quite sure we are not sinners or
hypocrites in it. If our religion is
worth anything, it is worth most in
the hour of trial; and if it does not
stand us in good stead in the time of
temptation and sorrow, what is the
use of it?</p>

<p>I. <span class="smcap">The character of God&rsquo;s people.</span>
They are partly described in the words
of our text, but I am obliged to go a
little farther afield for one part of
their character. Those who in the
time of danger will be kept and comforted
are a people who have a humble,
patient, present faith in God. I am
sure there are such, for they are
described&mdash;they describe themselves&mdash;in
the second verse of the chapter
before us. They are a humble people,
who dare not trust themselves, but
trust in God. They are a praying
people, who make their appeal to God
under a sense of need. Their appeal
is to His free grace. They are a waiting
people. If at once they have not
comfort and joy, they tarry and are
perfectly content to abide His time,
for it is sure to be best. That have a
present faith in God, for &ldquo;Be Thou
their arm every morning&rdquo; is their
prayer. They did not trust in God
years ago and get saved, and think
they can live without faith, but they
believe &ldquo;the just shall <i>live</i> by faith.&rdquo;
They look for everything to their God:
&ldquo;<i>Thou</i> art our salvation in the time of
trouble.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Our text gives a description of these
people by their various features. It
describes how they walk: &ldquo;He that
walketh righteously.&rdquo; Faith has an
elevating, ennobling effect upon our
entire manhood. The promise belongs
only to the people who come under
the description; see to it that you do
not take the comfort, if you do not
<span class="pagenum" id="p493">[p.&nbsp;493]</span>
come under the character! Study the
description of the daily walk and conversation
of this blessed man who is
to dwell on high.</p>

<p>The first feature which is described
is his <i>tongue.</i> &ldquo;He speaketh uprightly.&rdquo;
If you drew a portrait of a
man, you could not paint his tongue;
but if you give a description of a man&rsquo;s
character, you cannot omit his speech.
A man that lies, talks obscenely, &amp;c.,
is no child of God. The grace of God
very speedily sweetens a man&rsquo;s tongue.
A doctor says, &ldquo;Put out your tongue,&rdquo;
and he judges the symptoms of health
or disease thereby; and surely there
is no better test of character than the
condition of the tongue.</p>

<p>Next, the <i>heart.</i> &ldquo;He that despiseth
the gain of oppression.&rdquo; Not
only does he not oppress any man, nor
wish to gain anything by extortion, or
by any act of unrighteousness, but he
looks upon it as contemptible and despises
it. He likes gain if it comes
cleanly to him, and it is as welcome
to him as to another, but he will not
have a thing he cannot pray over.</p>

<p>Next comes the <i>ear.</i> &ldquo;That stoppeth
his ears from hearing of blood.&rdquo;
Men of war and those who delight in
war will tell to one another what they
did in battle and whom they slew;
and in those old times there were
tales of bloodshed that would have
made our ears to tingle, but the good
men in Jerusalem would not hear
them; they could not endure it. It
is not the hearing of blood alone we
must avoid, but the hearing of anything
tainted. The genuine Christian
feels he has mischief enough in his
own heart without adding to it.</p>

<p>Again, &ldquo;He shutteth his <i>eyes</i> from
seeing evil.&rdquo; He cannot help seeing
it as he goes his pilgrimage through
life, but as far as possible he tries to
avoid it. He does not go and find an
evening&rsquo;s amusement gazing upon it.
It were better to be blind, deaf, and
dumb than to see, and hear, and speak
in some places. The true believer is
a man who has himself well in hand.
He has a bit in the mouths of all the
horses that draw the chariot of life,
and he holds them in, and will not let
his eye, ear, tongue, foot, or hand carry
him away. He will have nothing to
do with evil: &ldquo;He shaketh his hand
from holding of bribes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>II. <span class="smcap">The security of such a man.</span>
Notice it first, as it is pictorially described:
&ldquo;He shall dwell on high.&rdquo;
The Assyrians were attacking
the country, and in times of invasion men
always went to the highest parts of
the country to escape from the enemy.
Well, this man shall have a quiet
resting-place on the heights, so high
up that his enemies cannot get at him.
They may plunder all round, but
cannot plunder him. The sentinel
on the crags of inaccessible rock shall,
standing out in the sunlight gleaming
calmly and brightly, bid defiance
to every foe. He shall dwell on the
heights, out of reach of the arrows.
&ldquo;His place of defence shall be the
munitions of rocks;&rdquo; not one rock, but
rocks; mass upon mass of mountain
shall stand between him and the foe, and
there shall he dwell in perfect security.
&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; but says one, &ldquo;they will starve
him out. There will be nothing for the
people to eat, and they will open the
doors and say, &lsquo;Come in! only give us
<span class="wsnw">bread.&rsquo;&thinsp;&rdquo;</span> &ldquo;Bread shall be given him,&rdquo;
and as he could not be driven out, so
he shall not be starved out, for the
bread of Heaven shall be given him,
if it come from nowhere else. &ldquo;But
even,&rdquo; says one, &ldquo;if there may be bread
brought into the city, they will run
short of water, and must eventually
capitulate through thirst.&rdquo; No, says
the promise, &ldquo;his water shall be
sure.&rdquo; There shall be springs that
never can be dried up within the
castle itself, and they shall drink and
drink as much as they will, and yet
the supplies shall never be exhausted.
&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; says one, &ldquo;this is poetry.&rdquo;
Just so: it is a poetical description,
but it is all founded on facts.</p>

<p>Look at the positive facts in the
actual experience of the child of God.
First, it is a matter of fact that the
man who believes in the Lord Jesus
Christ, and lives as a Christian should
live, lives on high. His mind is elevated
<span class="pagenum" id="p494">[p.&nbsp;494]</span>
above the common cares, trials,
and sorrows of life (H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I. 1080&ndash;1084,
4162, 4163). Many of you
know how secure and immutable your
defence is, for you have God&rsquo;s promise,
&ldquo;I will never leave nor forsake
thee.&rdquo; &ldquo;No good thing will I withhold
from him that walketh uprightly.&rdquo;
What munitions of rocks can be compared
with these things in which it is
impossible for God to lie? You are
dwelling where you must be safe; for,
first, you were chosen before the foundation
of the world, and God will not
lose His chosen, nor shall His decree
be frustrated. Next, you have been
bought with the precious blood of the
Son of God Himself, and He will never
lose what He has so dearly bought.
You have also been quickened by the
Holy Ghost and made to live unto
God, and that life cannot die. You
have been taken into the family of
God and made His child, and your
name shall never be taken out of the
family register. You are joined unto
Christ in one spirit; you are a member
of His body, of His flesh, and of
His bones; and shall Christ be dismembered,
the Son of God be rent
in twain? I feel I stand where all
the devils of hell cannot reach me,
where the angels of God might envy
me, and where I can say, &ldquo;Who shall
separate me from the love of God in
Christ Jesus our Lord?&rdquo; and challenge
earth and hell and heaven alike&mdash;if
so it please them&mdash;to assail me, for
who can harm me, if my confidence be
in the living God?</p>

<p>The poetic utterance, &ldquo;Thy bread
shall be given thee,&rdquo; is also literally
true. You have sometimes had very
little, but have always had <i>enough.</i>
When God multiplied the meal and
the oil of the widow of Zarephath, I
do believe that every day Elijah lived
with her she had to scrape the bottom
of the barrel. We are not told it
filled up at once. Just so, you may
often have to reach the bottom of the
barrel, and the oil may seem to come
a drop at a time: this is about as
much as you want, and if you get as
much as you can eat at one meal, it is
all the fresher, and does not breed
worms like the manna in the wilderness.
It is the heavenly bread we
have sometimes to be anxious about;
but if ministers do not feed you, God
will Himself.</p>

<p>As for the living waters, they shall
always flow both in summer and
winter. They shall be within thee a
well of living water springing up into
eternal life. But words cannot tell
the privileges of the man who dwells
with God. He need not wish to
change places with the Archangels.</p>

<p>Friend, if you are not a Christian,
do not profess to be one; do not hope
by mere empty profession to win the
blessedness of God&rsquo;s people. Confess
your sins, and seek the righteousness
of God. Fain would I drop into your
mouths that prayer, &ldquo;O Lord, be gracious
unto us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As for you that are really striving
to do that which is right and true, at
the same time trusting alone in Jesus
for your salvation, I would say to you,
What a happy people we ought to be!
We ought every one of us to have a
shining face (H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I. 756&ndash;762, 3037&ndash;3039).
I do not know where the
Queen is just now, but if I were a
dove and could fly in the air, I would
soon find her, for I should see the
royal flag flying on the flag-staff.
Wherever the monarch is, there will
the streamer be found flying. Is the
King with you to-day? If so, keep
the flag flying. Let the banner fly to
the breeze, and let the world know
that there are no people so happy,
none so much to be envied, as believers
in Jesus Christ.&mdash;<i>C.&nbsp;H. Spurgeon.</i></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 class="tdc" id="o365"><span class="smcap">Spreading the Letter Before the Lord.</span></h3>

<p class="bq">xxxvii.&nbsp;14. <i>And Hezekiah received the letter, &amp;c.</i></p>

<p>The letter was an insolent cartel of
defiance from the Assyrian king Sennacherib,
full as much of blasphemous
defiance against God as of insolence
<span class="pagenum" id="p495">[p.&nbsp;495]</span>
to God&rsquo;s servant. It represents the
conflict between Assyria and Judah
as being a struggle between the gods
of one nation and the God of the other.
The point of it is: &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let the God
in whom thou trusteth deceive thee,
saying Jerusalem shall not be delivered
into the hands of Assyria. Thou hast
seen what Assyria has done to all
lands, and is thy God any better than
theirs?&rdquo; So the king of Judah, very
simple and child-like, picks up the
piece of blasphemy and goes up to the
temple and spreads it out before God.
A very <i>na&iuml;ve</i> piece of unconscious
symbolism! The meaning of it comes
out in the prayer that follows: &ldquo;Open
Thine eyes, O Lord, and see,&rdquo; &amp;c. It
is for <i>Thee</i> to act. That is the essential
meaning of Hezekiah&rsquo;s action.</p>

<p>I. It was an appeal to God&rsquo;s knowledge.
For <i>his</i> comfort it was necessary
to make this appeal. That which
influences and agitates us, we need in
some way to spread before the Lord.
When some great anxiety strikes its
talons deep into our hearts, we need
to have the truth made clear to ourselves.
The Eyes up yonder see all
about it. A plain old piece of commonplace,
but, oh! there is a deep,
unutterable consolation when a man
realises this. &ldquo;Thy Father which is
in secret, <i>seeth</i> in secret.&rdquo;</p>

<p>II. It was an appeal to God&rsquo;s
honour. His prayer was this in
effect: &ldquo;Hear all the words of Sennacherib,
who has sent to reproach
the living God. I say nothing about
myself, but it is Thine honour that is
threatened. If this insolent braggart
does the thing which he threatens,
then it will be said, &lsquo;Forasmuch as
this Jehovah was not able to save His
people, therefore He let them perish;&rsquo;
those who worship other gods will
say, &lsquo;Jehovah is a name without
meaning&rsquo;&mdash;<i>Thy</i> name, which is above
every name!&rdquo; If a man has not got
something like that in his prayers,
they are poor prayers. With all humility,
yet with all self-confidence, ask
Him, not so much to deliver you, as to
be true to His character and His promises,
to be self-consistent with all
that He has been; and let us feel, as
we have a right to feel, that if any
human soul, that ever in the faintest,
poorest, humblest manner put out a
trembling hand of confidence towards
His great hand to grasp it, was suffered
to go down and perish, there is a
blight and blot on the fair fame of
God before the whole creation which
nothing can obliterate. But the feeblest
cry shall be answered, the feeblest
faith rewarded! Let us grasp the
thought that not only for our own
poor selves&mdash;though, blessed be God,
He does take our happiness for a worthy
object&mdash;but because His honour
and fair fame are so inextricably wound
with our well-being, He must answer
the cries of His people (Ezek. xxxvi.&nbsp;22&ndash;24).</p>

<p>III. Let us take out of the account,
not only what we ought to do when
we go to God in prayer, but the kind
of things we ought to take to Him.
Every difficulty, danger, trial, temptation,
or blasphemy by which His
name is polluted, should be at once
spread out before the Lord. But most
of all the common things of everyday
life! The small boy, whom one of our
writers tells of, who used to pray that
he might have strength given to him to
learn his Latin declension, had a better
understanding of prayer than the men
of the world can understand (H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I.
3756, 3757).</p>

<p>IV. Another lesson: If you have
not been in the habit of going to the
House of God at other times, it will
be a hard job to find your way there
when your eyes are blinded with tears,
and your hearts heavy with anxiety.
Hezekiah had cultivated a habit of
trusting God and referring everything
to Him; so he went straight into the
Temple as by instinct, where he could
have found his way in the dark, and
spread this letter before the Lord as a
matter of course. It is a poor thing
when a man&rsquo;s religion is like a waterproof
coat, that is only good to wear
when it rains, and has to be taken off
when the weather improves a little!
If you want to get the blessedness of
fellowship with God and help from
<span class="pagenum" id="p496">[p.&nbsp;496]</span>
Him in the dark days, learn the road
to the Temple in sunshine and gladness,
and do not wait for the bellow of
the pitiless storm and darkness upon
the path, before you go up to the Temple
of God (H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I. 3877&ndash;3879).</p>

<p>V. What do we get by this habit
of spreading out everything before
God?</p>

<p>1. Valuable counsel. I do not know
anything that has such a power of
clearing a man&rsquo;s way, scattering mists,
removing misconceptions, letting us
see the true nature of some dazzling
specious temptations, as the habit of
turning to prayer. In ninety-nine
cases out of a hundred, the thing that
perplexes us is that the steadiness of
the hand that holds the microscope is
affected by the beating of the heart
and the passionate desires and wishes,
and so there is nothing defined and
clear; it is all a haze. Firmness of
hand, clearness of vision, come in
prayer to the man who is accustomed
to take the harassing &ldquo;letter,&rdquo; and
spread it out before the Lord (H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I.
3741&ndash;3743).</p>

<p>2. A very accurate and easily applied
test. I do not wonder that as many
of us do not like to pray about our
plans and about our anxieties; it is
either because the plans have no God
in them, or the anxieties have no faith.
Anything we cannot pray about, we
had better not touch. And anxiety
that is not substantial enough to bear
lifting and laying before God, ought
never to trouble us. Test your lives,
your thoughts, your affairs, your purposes
by this. Will they stand carriage
to the Temple? If not, the sooner
you get rid of them the better. And
then, &ldquo;In nothing be anxious; but in
everything by prayer and supplication
with thanksgiving let your requests by
made known unto God; and,&rdquo; in spite
of all the blatant Sennacheribs who
have poured out their insolent blasphemies,
&ldquo;the peace of God, which
passeth all understanding, shall guard
your hearts and your thoughts in
Christ Jesus.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Alexander Maclaren,
in Outlines of Sermons on the Old Testament,</i>
pp. 81&ndash;85.</p>

<h4 class="tdc"><i>TRANSLATIONS OF THE PROPHECIES OF ISAIAH.</i></h4>

<p>Translations, at once accurate and varied, are among the most valuable of
all helps in the study of Scripture. It was, therefore, the intention of the
supplier of this volume to give in four parallel columns the translations
of Isaiah which occur in the Commentaries of Alexander, Delitzsch, and Henderson,
and in the <i>Revised English Bible.</i> Considerations of space, have, however, compelled
him to confine himself to the two first named; and it is believed that
these will be acceptable even to those who possess the Commentaries whence
they are taken. They are interwoven with the comments, and a continuous
study of them is thus rendered difficult. The divisions and subdivisions
in the second column are those given in Delitzsch&rsquo;s Commentary. For a very
prompt and general permission to make this use of that great work, hearty
thanks are here accorded to Messrs. T. &amp; T. Clark of Edinburgh.</p>

<p>The Vision of Isaiah, the son of Amoz,
which he saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem,
in the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz,
Hezekiah, kings of Judah.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="tdc"><span class="smcap">sin and suffering.&mdash;chap. i.</span> 2&ndash;31.</p>

<p>2. Hear, O heavens; and give ear, O earth;
for Jehovah speaks. Sons I have reared and
brought up, and they, even they, have rebelled
against Me. 3.&nbsp;The ox knoweth his owner,
and the ass his master&rsquo;s crib: Israel doth not
know, My people doth not consider.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="pA2L">[p.&nbsp;A2L]</span>
4. A sinful nation, people heavy with iniquity,
a seed of evil doers, sons corrupting
themselves! They have forsaken Jehovah;
they have treated with contempt the Holy
One of Israel; they are alienated back
again.</p>

<p>5. Whereupon can ye be stricken any more,
(that) ye add revolt? The whole head is sick,
and the whole heart faint. 6.&nbsp;From the sole
of the foot even to the head, there is not in it
a sound place; (it is) wound and bruise and
fresh stroke. They have not been pressed,
and they have not been bound, and it has not
been mollified with ointment. 7. Your land&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
a waste! Your towns&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. burnt with
fire! Your ground&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. before you strangers
(are) devouring it, and a waste like the overthrow
of strangers. 8.&nbsp;And the daughter of
Zion is left like a booth in a vineyard, like a
lodge in a melon field, like a watched city.
9.&nbsp;Except Jehovah of hosts had left unto us a very
small remnant, we should have been like
Sodom, we should have resembled Gomorrah.</p>

<p>10. Here the word of Jehovah, ye judges of
Sodom; give ear to the law of our God, ye
people of Gomorrah! 11.&nbsp;For what (end) is
the multitude of your sacrifices to Me? saith
Jehovah. I am full of burnt offerings of rams
and the fat of fed beasts, and the blood of
bullocks and lambs and he-goats I desire not.
12.&nbsp;When you come to appear before Me, who
hath required this at your hands to tread My
courts? 13.&nbsp;Ye shall not add to bring a vain
offering. Incense is an abomination to Me;
(so are) new-moon and Sabbath, the calling of
the convocation: I cannot bear iniquity and
holy day. 14.&nbsp;Your new-moons and your
convocations My soul hateth; they have
become a burden to Me, I am weary of bearing
(them). 15.&nbsp;And when you spread your
hands, I will hide Mine eyes from you; also
when ye multiply prayer, I am not hearing;
your hands are full of blood.</p>

<p>16. Wash you, purify yourselves; remove
the evil of your doings from before Mine eyes;
cease to do evil; 17.&nbsp;learn to do good, seek
judgment, redress wrong, judge the fatherless,
befriend the widow.</p>

<p>18. Come now, and let us reason together,
saith Jehovah. Though your sins be as
scarlet, they shall be white as snow; though
they be red as crimson, they shall be as wool.
19.&nbsp;If ye consent and hear, the good of the
land ye shall eat; 20.&nbsp;and if ye refuse and
rebel, by the sword shall ye be eaten: the
mouth of Jehovah hath spoken it.</p>

<p>21. How has she become an harlot, the faithful
city! full of justice, righteousness lodged in
it, and now murderers. 22.&nbsp;Thy silver is
become dross, thy wine weakened with water.
23.&nbsp;Thy rulers are rebels and fellows of thieves,
every one of them loving a bribe, and pursuing
rewards. The fatherless they judge not, and
the cause of the widow cometh not unto
them.</p>

<p>24. Therefore, saith the Lord, Jehovah of
<span class="pagenum" id="pA3L">[p.&nbsp;A3L]</span>
hosts, the Mighty One of Israel, Ah, I will
comfort Myself of My adversaries, and I will
avenge Myself of Mine enemies; 25.&nbsp;and I will
turn My hand upon them, and will purge out
thy dross like purity (itself), and I will take
away all thine alloy. 26.&nbsp;And I will restore
thy judges as at first, and thy counsellors as
in the beginning, after which thou shalt be
called City of Righteousness, a faithful
State.</p>

<p>27. Zion shall be redeemed in judgment, and
her converts in righteousness; 28.&nbsp;and the
breaking of apostates and sinners (shall be)
together, and the forsaken of Jehovah shall
cease. 29.&nbsp;For they shall be ashamed of the
oaks which ye have desired, and ye shall be
confounded for the gardens ye have chosen;
30.&nbsp;for ye shall be like an oak fading (in) its
leaf, and like a garden which has no water;
31.&nbsp;and the strong shall become tow, and his
work a spark, and they shall burn both of
them together, (there) shall be no one quenching
(them).</p>

<p class="tdc"><span class="smcap">the reign of the messiah, and intervening
judgments on the jews.&mdash;chaps. ii.&ndash;iv.</span></p>

<p>II.&mdash;1. The word which Isaiah the son of
Amoz saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem.</p>

<p>2. And it shall be in the end of the days,
the mountain of Jehovah&rsquo;s house shall be
established on the top of the mountains, and
exalted from the hills, and all nations shall
flow unto it. 3.&nbsp;And many nations shall go
and shall say, Come, and let us ascend to the
mountain of Jehovah, to the house of the
God of Jacob; and He will teach of us of
His ways, and we will go in His paths: for
out of Zion shall go forth law, and the word
of Jehovah from Jerusalem. 4.&nbsp;And He
shall judge between the nations, and decide
for many peoples. And they shall beat their
swords into plough-shares, and their spears
into pruning-hooks. Nation shall not lift
up sword against nation, neither shall they
learn war any more.</p>

<p>5. O house of Jacob, come ye, and let us
walk in the light of Jehovah.</p>

<p>6. Because Thou hast forsaken Thy people,
the house of Jacob, because they are replenished
from the east and (full of) soothsayers
like the Philistines, and with the children of
strangers they abound. 7.&nbsp;And their land is
filled with silver and gold, and there is no end
to their treasures; and their land is filled with
horses, and there is no end to their treasures.
8.&nbsp;And their land is filled with idols, to the
work of their hands they bow down, to that
which their fingers have made.</p>

<p>9. And so the mean man is bowed down,
and the great man is brought low, and do
not Thou forgive them. 10.&nbsp;Go into the rock,
and hide thee in the dust, from before the
terror of Jehovah and from the glory of His
majesty. 11.&nbsp;The eyes of the loftiness of
men are cast down, and the height of man is
brought low, and Jehovah alone is exalted in
that day.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="pA4L">[p.&nbsp;A4L]</span>
12. For there is a day to Jehovah of hosts
upon everything high and lofty, and upon everything
exalted, and it shall come down; 13.&nbsp;and
upon all the cedars of Lebanon, that are high
and lofty, and on all the oaks of Bashan;
14.&nbsp;and upon all the high mountains, and upon all
the elevated hills; 15.&nbsp;and upon every high
tower, and upon every fenced wall; 16.&nbsp;and
upon all ships of Tarshish, and upon all images
of desire. 17.&nbsp;And (thus) shall the loftiness
of man be cast down, and the pride of man be
brought low, and Jehovah alone exalted in that
day [or, so sinks the loftiness of man and bows
the pride of man, and Jehovah alone is exalted
in that day].</p>

<p>18. And as for the idols the whole shall pass
away. 19.&nbsp;And they shall enter into the caves
of the rocks and into the holes of the earth,
from before the terror of Jehovah and the
glory of His majesty when He arises to terrify
the earth. 20.&nbsp;And that day shall man cast his
idols of silver and his idols of gold, which they
have made for him to worship, to the moles and
the bats; 21.&nbsp;to go into the clefts of the rocks,
and into the fissures of the cliffs, from before
the terror of Jehovah, and from the glory of
His majesty, in His arising to terrify the earth.</p>

<p>22. Cease ye from man, whose breath is in
his nostrils, for wherein is he to be accounted
of? III.&mdash;1.&nbsp;For, behold, the Lord, Jehovah
of hosts, is taking away from Jerusalem and
from Judah the stay and the staff, the whole
stay of bread, and the whole stay of water;
2.&nbsp;hero and warrior, judge and prophet, and
diviner and elder; 3.&nbsp;the chief of fifty, and
the favourite, and the counsellor, and the
skilful artificer, and the expert enchanter.
4.&nbsp;And I will give children to be their rulers,
and childish things shall govern them.
5.&nbsp;And the people shall act tyrannically, man
against man, and man against his fellow. They
shall be insolent, the youth to the old man,
and the mean man to the noble. 6.&nbsp;When a
man shall take hold of his brother in his
father&rsquo;s house (saying), Thou hast raiment, a
ruler shalt thou be to us, and this ruin under
thy hand; 7.&nbsp;in that day he shall lift up his
voice saying, I will not be a healer, and in my
house is no bread, and there is no clothing:
ye shall not make me a ruler of the people.</p>

<p>8. For Jerusalem totters and Judah falls,
(because) their tongues and their doings are
against Jehovah, to resist His glorious eyes.
9.&nbsp;The expression of their countenance testifies
against them, and their sin, like Sodom,
they disclose, they hide it not. Woe unto
their soul! for they have done evil to themselves.
10.&nbsp;Say ye of the righteous that it
shall be well, for the fruits of their doings
they shall eat. 11.&nbsp;Woe unto the wicked, ill,
for the thing done by his hands shall be done
to him. 12.&nbsp;My people! their oppressors are
childish, and women rule over them. My
people! thy leaders are seducers, and the way
of thy paths they swallow up.</p>

<p>13. Jehovah standeth up to plead, and is
standing to judge the nations. 14.&nbsp;Jehovah
<span class="pagenum" id="pA5L">[p.&nbsp;A5L]</span>
will enter into judgment with the elders of
His people and the chiefs thereof. And ye
(even ye) have consumed the vineyard, the
spoil of the poor is in your houses. 15.&nbsp;What
mean ye that ye crush My people, and grind
the faces of the poor? saith the Lord Jehovah
of hosts.</p>

<p>16. And Jehovah said, Because the
daughters of Zion are lofty, and walk with
outstretched neck, and gazing with their eyes,
and with a tripping walk they walk, and
with their feet they make a tinkling,
17.&nbsp;therefore the Lord will make bald the crown
of the daughters of Zion, and their nakedness
Jehovah will uncover. 18.&nbsp;In that day the
Lord will take away the bravery of the ankle-bands,
and the cauls, and the crescents,
19.&nbsp;the pendants, and the bracelets, and the veils,
20.&nbsp;the caps, the ankle-chains, and the girdles,
and the houses of breath, and the amulets,
21.&nbsp;the rings, and the nose-jewels, 22.&nbsp;the
holiday dresses, and the mantles, and the
robes, and the purses, 23.&nbsp;the mirrors, and the
tunics, and the turbans, and the veils. 24.&nbsp;And
it shall be (that) instead of perfume there shall be
stench, and instead of a girdle a rope, and
instead of braided work baldness, and instead
of a full robe a girding of sackcloth, burning
instead of beauty. 25.&nbsp;Thy men by the sword
shall fall, and thy strength in war. 26.&nbsp;And
her gates shall lament and mourn, and being
emptied she shall sit upon the ground.
IV.&mdash;1.&nbsp;And in that day seven women shall lay hold on
one man, saying, We will eat our own bread, and
wear our own apparel; only let thy name be
called upon us, take thou away our reproach.</p>

<p>2. In that day shall the Branch of Jehovah
be for honour and for glory, and the fruit of
the earth for sublimity and beauty, to the
escaped of Israel. 3.&nbsp;And it shall be that
the left in Zion and the spared in Jerusalem
shall be called holy, every one written to life
in Jerusalem, 4.&nbsp;when the Lord shall have
washed away the filth of the daughters of Zion,
and the bloodguiltiness of Jerusalem shall
purge from its midst by a spirit of judgment
and a spirit of burning. 5.&nbsp;And Jehovah will
create over the whole extent of mount Zion,
and over her assembles, a cloud by day, and
smoke and the brightness of a burning fire by
night; for over all the glory <i>there shall be</i> a
covering; 6.&nbsp;and there shall be a shelter for a
shadow by day from heat, and a covert
and for a hiding place from storm and from
rain.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="tdc"><span class="smcap">the parable of the vineyard.&mdash;chap. v.</span></p>

<p>1. I will sing, if you please, of my friend,
my friend&rsquo;s song of his vineyard.</p>

<p>My friend had a vineyard in a hill of great
fertility; 2.&nbsp;and he digged it up, and gathered
out the stones thereof, and planted it with
Sorek, and built a tower in the midst of it;
and he waited for it to produce grapes, and it
produced wild grapes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="pA6L">[p.&nbsp;A6L]</span>
3. And now, O inhabitant of Jerusalem and
man of Judah, judge, I pray you, between me
and my vineyard. 4.&nbsp;What more is there to
be done to my vineyard that I have not done
in it? Why did I wait for it to bear grapes,
and it bore wild grapes?</p>

<p>5. And now I will let you know if you please
what I am about to do to my vineyard:
Remove its hedge, and it shall become a
pasture; break down its wall, and it shall
become a trampling-place; 6.&nbsp;and I render
it a desolation. It shall not be pruned and it
shall not be dressed, and there shall come up
thorns and briars. And I will lay my commands
upon the clouds from raining rain upon
it. 7.&nbsp;For the vineyard of Jehovah of hosts
is the house of Israel, and the man of Judah
is the plant of His pleasures. And He waited
for judgment, and behold bloodshed, for righteousness,
and behold a cry!</p>

<p>8. Woe to the joiners of house with house,
field to field they bring together, even to a
failure of place, and ye are made to dwell by
yourselves in the midst of the land. 9.&nbsp;In
my ears Jehovah of hosts (is saying), Of a truth
many houses shall become a desolation, great
and good for want of an inhabitant. 10.&nbsp;For
ten acres shall make one bath, and a bower of
seed shall produce an ephah.</p>

<p>11. Woe to those rising early in the morning
to pursue strong drink, delaying in the
twilight (until) wine inflames them. 12.&nbsp;And
the harp and viol, the tabret, and the pipe,
and wine (compose) their feasts; and the work
of Jehovah they will not look at, and the
operation of His hands they have not seen.</p>

<p>13. Therefore my people have gone into
exile for want of knowledge, and their glory
are men of hunger, and their multitude dry
with thirst. 14.&nbsp;Therefore the grave has
enlarged herself and opened her mouth without
measure, and down goes her pomp and
her noise and her crowd and he that rejoices
in her; 15.&nbsp;and man is brought low, and
man is cast down, and the eyes of the lofty
are cast down; 16.&nbsp;and Jehovah of hosts
is exalted in judgment, and the Mighty, the
Holy One, is sanctified in righteousness;
17.&nbsp;and lambs shall feed as (in) their pasture,
and the wastes of the fat ones shall sojourners
devour.</p>

<p>18. Woe to the drawers of iniquity with
cords of vanity, and sin as with a cart-rope;
19.&nbsp;those who say, Let Him speed, let
Him hasten His work that we may see; and
<span class="pagenum" id="pA7L">[p.&nbsp;A7L]</span>
let the counsel of the Holy One of Israel draw
night and come, that we may know (it).</p>

<p>20. Woe unto those saying to evil good, and
to good evil, putting darkness for light and
light for darkness, putting bitter for sweet
and sweet for bitter.</p>

<p>21. Woe unto the wise in their (own) eyes,
and the prudent in their own estimation.</p>

<p>22. Woe to the mighty men that drink wine,
and men of strength that mingle strong drink;
23.&nbsp;justifying the guilty as the result of a
bribe, and the righteousness of the righteous
they will take from him.</p>

<p>24. Therefore as a tongue of fire devours
chaff, and as ignited grass falls away, their
root shall be as rottenness, and their blossom
as fine dust shall go up. For they have
rejected the law of Jehovah of hosts, and the
word of the Holy One of Israel they have
treated with contempt. 25.&nbsp;Therefore the
anger of Jehovah has burned against His
people, and He stretched forth His hand
against them, and smote them, and the
mountains trembled, and their carcass was
like sweeping in the midst of the streets.</p>

<p>In all this His anger was not turned back,
and still His hand is stretched out; 26.&nbsp;and
He raises a signal to the nations from afar, and
whistle for him from the ends of the earth;
and behold in haste, swift he shall come.
27.&nbsp;There is no one faint, and there is no one
stumbling among them. He sleeps not, and
he slumbers not, and the girdle of his loins is
not opened and the latchet of his sandals is
not broken; 28.&nbsp;whose arrows are sharpened
and all his bows bent; the hoofs of his horses
like flint are reckoned, and his wheels like a
whirlwind. 29.&nbsp;He has a roar like the lioness,
and he shall roar like the young lions, and
shall growl, and seize the prey, and secure it,
none delivering (it). 30.&nbsp;And he shall roar
against him in that day like the roaring of a
sea. And he shall look to the land, and
behold darkness! Anguish and light! It is
dark in the clouds thereof!</p>

<p>1. In the year that king Uzziah died (<span class="smcap">b.c.</span>
758), I saw also the Lord sitting on a
throne high and lifted up, and His skirts filling
the palace. 2.&nbsp;Seraphim standing above
it. Six wings to each. With two he covers
his face, and with two he covers his feet, and
<span class="pagenum" id="pA8L">[p.&nbsp;A8L]</span>
with two he flies. 3.&nbsp;And one cried to
another, and said,</p>

<p class="bqpoemr">Holy, Holy, Holy! <i>is</i> Jehovah of hosts!<br />
The fulness of the whole earth is His glory!</p>

<p>4. Then stirred the bases of the thresholds
at the voice that cried, and the house is filled
with smoke.</p>

<p>5. And I said, Woe is me, for I am
undone! for a man of impure lips am I, and
in the midst of a people of impure lips I am
dwelling: for the King, Jehovah of hosts, my
eyes have seen.</p>

<p>6. Then there flew to me one of the
seraphim, and in his hand a live coal; with
tongs he took it from off the altar; 7.&nbsp;and he
caused it to touch my mouth, and said, Lo,
this hath touched thy lips, and thy iniquity is
gone, and thy sin shall be atoned for.</p>

<p>8. And I heard the voice of the Lord saying,
Whom shall I send, and who will go for
us? And I said, Here am I; behold me;
send me.</p>

<p>9. And He said, Go and say to this people,
Hear indeed, but understand not; and see
indeed, but know not. 10.&nbsp;Make fat the
heart of this people, and its ears make heavy,
and its eyes smear; lest it see with its eyes,
and with its ears hear, and its heart understand,
and it turn to me, and be healed.</p>

<p>11 And I said, How long, Lord?</p>

<p>And He said, Until that cities are desolate
for want of an inhabitant, and houses for
want of men, and the land shall be desolate, a
waste; 12.&nbsp;and Jehovah shall have put far
off the men, and great shall be that which is
left in the midst of the land. 13.&nbsp;And yet in
it a tenth shall return and be for a consuming;
like the terebinth and like the oak which in
falling have substance in them, a holy seed (is)
the substance of it.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="tdc"><span class="smcap">prophesies relating to the reign of ahaz.&mdash;chaps. vii.&ndash;xii.</span></p>

<p>1. And it was in the days of Ahaz, son of
Jotham, son of Uzziah, king of Judah, Rezin,
king of Aram [or Syria], and Pekah, son of
Remaliah, king of Israel, came up to Jerusalem
to war against it; and he was not able
to war against it. 2.&nbsp;And it was told the
house of David, saying, Syria resteth upon
Ephraim: and his heart and the heart of the
people shook, like the shaking of the trees of
a wood before a wind.</p>

<p>3. And Jehovah said to Isaiah son of
Amoz, Go out to meet Ahaz, thou and
Shear-jashub thy son, to the end of the conduit
of the upper pool, to the highway of the
fuller&rsquo;s field. 4.&nbsp;And thou shalt say to him,
<span class="pagenum" id="pA9L">[p.&nbsp;A9L]</span>
Be cautious and be quiet; fear not, nor let
thy heart be soft before these two smoking
tails of firebrands, in the heat of the anger
of Rezin and Syria and the son of Remaliah.
5.&nbsp;Because Syria has devised evil against thee,
also Ephraim and Remaliah&rsquo;s son, saying, 6.&nbsp;We
will go up into Judah and vex it, and make
a breach in it (thereby subduing it) to ourselves,
and let us make a king in the midst
of it, to wit, the son of Tabeal: 7.&nbsp;thus saith
the Lord Jehovah, It shall not stand, and it
shall not be; 8.&nbsp;because the head of Aram is
Damascus, and the head of Damascus is Rezin,
for in yet sixty-and-five years shall Ephraim
be broken from (being) a people; 9.&nbsp;for the
head of Ephraim is Samaria, and the head of
Samaria is Remaliah&rsquo;s son. If you will not
believe (it is) because you are not to be
established.</p>

<p>10. And Jehovah added to speak unto
Ahaz, saying, 11.&nbsp;Ask for thee a sign from
Jehovah thy God, ask deep or high above.
12.&nbsp;And Ahaz said, I will not ask, and I will
not tempt Jehovah. 13.&nbsp;And he said, Hear,
I pray you, O house of David! is it too little
for you to weary men, that you weary my
God? 14.&nbsp;Therefore the Lord Himself will
give you sign. Behold! the virgin pregnant
and bringing forth a son, and she calls his
name Immanuel. 15.&nbsp;Curds and honey shall
he eat until he shall know (how) to reject the
evil and choose the good; 16.&nbsp;for before the
child shall know (how) to reject the evil
to choose the good, the land, of whose two
kings thou art afraid, shall be forsaken.</p>

<p>17. Jehovah will bring upon thee, and on
thy people, and on thy father&rsquo;s house, days
which have not come since the departure of
Ephraim from Jacob, to wit, the king of
Assyria. 18.&nbsp;And it shall be in that day
that Jehovah will whistle for the fly which is
in the edge of the rivers of Egypt, and for
the bee which is in Assyria; 19.&nbsp;and they
come and rest all of them in the desolate
valleys, and in the clefts of rocks, and in all
thorn-hedges, and in all pastures. 20.&nbsp;In
that day will the Lord shave, with a razor
hired in the parts beyond the river, with the
king of Assyria, the head and the hair of the
feet, and also the beard will it take away.
21.&nbsp;And it shall be in that day (that) a man
shall save alive a young cow and two sheep;
22.&nbsp;and it shall be (that) from the abundance
of the yielding of milk, he shall eat butter;
for butter and honey shall every one eat that
is left in the midst of the land. 23.&nbsp;And it
shall be in that day (that) every place where
there shall be a thousand vines at a thousand
silverlings, shall be for thorns and briers.
24.&nbsp;With arrows and with bows shall one go
thither, because thorns and briers shall the
whole land be; 25.&nbsp;and all the hills which
are digged with the hoe, thou shalt not go
(even) there for fear of briers and thorns, and
they shall be for a sending-place of cattle and
a trampling-place of sheep.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="pA10L">[p.&nbsp;A10L]</span>
VIII.&mdash;1. And Jehovah said to me, Take thee a
great tablet, and write upon it with a man&rsquo;s
pen, to Maher-shalal-hash-baz. 2.&nbsp;And I
(Jehovah) will take to witness for me credible
witnesses, to wit, Uriah the priest, and
Zechariah, son of Jeberechiah.</p>

<p>3. And I approached unto the prophetess,
and she conceived and bare a son, and Jehovah
said to me, Call his name Maher-shalal-hash-baz:
4.&nbsp;for before the child shall know (how)
to cry, My father, and my mother, they shall
take away the wealth of Damascus and the
spoil of Samaria before the king of Assyria.</p>

<p>5. And Jehovah added to speak to me again,
saying&mdash;</p>

<p>6. Because this people hath forsaken the
waters of Shiloah that go softly, and joy with
respect to Rezin and the son of Remaliah,
7.&nbsp;therefore, behold! the Lord (is) bringing up
upon them the waters of the river, its strong
and many waters, to wit, the king of Assyria
and all his glory, and it shall come up over all
the channels and go over all its banks, 8.&nbsp;and
it shall pass over into Judah, overflow and
pass through, to the neck shall it reach, and
the spreading of its wings shall be the filling
of the breadth of thy land, O Immanuel!</p>

<p>9. Be wicked and be broken, and give ear
all the remote parts of the earth! Gird yourselves
and be broken; gird yourselves and be broken!
10.&nbsp;Devise a plan, and it shall be defeated;
speak a word, and it shall not stand: for God
(is) with us.</p>

<p>11. For thus said Jehovah unto me in
strength of hand, and instructed me away from
walking in the way of this people, saying,
12.&nbsp;Ye shall not call conspiracy everything which
this people calleth conspiracy, and its fear ye
shall not fear nor be afraid. 13.&nbsp;Jehovah of
hosts, Him shall ye sanctify; and He shall be
your fear, and He shall be your dread.
14.&nbsp;And He shall be for a holy thing, and for a
stone of stumbling and for a rock of offence to
the two houses of Israel; for a gin and for a
snare to the inhabitants of Jerusalem. 15.&nbsp;And many
shall stumble over them, and fall and be
broken and be snared, and be taken.</p>

<p>16. Bind up the testimony, seal the law,
in my disciples. 17.&nbsp;And I will wait for
Jehovah, that hideth His face from the house
of Jacob, and will expect Him. 18.&nbsp;Behold, I
and the children which Jehovah hath given
me are (for) signs and for wonders in Israel
from Jehovah of hosts, the (One) dwelling in
mount Zion. 19.&nbsp;And when they shall say
to you, Seek unto the spirits and to the
wizards, the chirpers and the mutterers:
should not a people seek to its God, for the
living to the dead? 20.&nbsp;To the law and to the
testimony: if they speak not according to this
word, (they are they) to whom there is no dawn.
<span class="pagenum" id="pA11L">[p.&nbsp;A11L]</span>
21.&nbsp;And they shall pass through it hardly
bestead and hungry: and it shall be that when
they are hungry they shall fret themselves,
and curse their king and their God, and shall
look upward. 22.&nbsp;And to the earth he shall
look; and behold distress and darkness, dimness
of anguish, and (into) darkness (he shall
be) driven. [&mdash; Or, The dimness of anguish
and of darkness is dispelled.]</p>

<p>IX.&mdash;1. For (there shall) not (be) darkness
(for ever) to her who is now distressed. As
the former time degraded the land of Zebulon
and the land of Naphtali, so the latter glorifies
the way of the sea, the bank of the Jordan,
Galilee of the Gentiles.</p>

<p>2. The people, those walking in the dark,
have seen a great light: the dwellers in the
shadow of death, light has beamed upon them.
3.&nbsp;Thou hast enlarged the nation, Thou hast
increased its joy: (they) rejoice before Thee
like the joy in harvest, as men rejoice when
they divide the spoil; 4.&nbsp;that the yoke of his
burden, and the rod of his shoulder, and the
staff of the one driving him, Thou hast broken
as in the day of Midian. 5.&nbsp;For all the
armour of the armed man in the tumult, and
the garments rolled in blood, shall be for burning,
food of fire. 6.&nbsp;For a son is born to us,
a son is given to us, and the government is
upon his shoulder, and his name is called
Wonderful, Counsellor, Mighty God, Everlasting
Father, Prince of Peace. 7.&nbsp;To the
increase of the government and to the peace
there shall be no end, upon the throne of
David and upon his kingdom, to establish it
and to confirm it, in justice and in righteousness
from henceforth and for ever. The zeal
of Jehovah of hosts shall do this.</p>

<p>8. The Lord sent a word unto Jacob, and
it came down into Israel. 9.&nbsp;And they know,
the people, all of them, Ephraim and the
inhabitant of Samaria, in pride and in greatness
of heart saying, 10.&nbsp;&ldquo;Bricks are fallen,
and hewn stone will we build; sycamores are
felled, and cedars will we substitute.&rdquo;
11.&nbsp;And (now) Jehovah raises up above him the
enemies of Rezin, and he will instigate his
own enemies: 12.&nbsp;Aram before, and Philistia
behind, and they devour Israel with open
mouth. For all this His wrath does not turn
back, and still His hand is stretched out.</p>

<p>13. And the people has not turned to Him
that smote them, and Jehovah of hosts they
have not sought. 14.&nbsp;And Jehovah has cut
off from Israel head and tail, branch and root,
in one day. 15.&nbsp;The elder and the favourite,
be (is) the head, and the prophet teaching
falsehood, he (is) the tail. 16.&nbsp;The leaders of
this people have been seducers, and the led
of them (are) swallowed up. 17.&nbsp;Therefore
the Lord will not rejoice over their young men,
and on their orphans and their widows He
will not have mercy, for every one of them is
profane and an evil-doer, and every mouth
<span class="pagenum" id="pA12L">[p.&nbsp;A12L]</span>
(is) speaking folly. For all this His wrath is
not turned back, and still is His hand outstretched.</p>

<p>18. For wickedness burneth as the fire,
thorns and briers it consumes, then kindles
in the thickets of the forest, and they roll
themselves upward, a column of smoke.
19.&nbsp;In the wrath of Jehovah of hosts the land is
darkened, and the people is like food of fire:
one another they do not spare. 20.&nbsp;And he
tears on the right hand, and is hungry (still),
and devours on the left, and (still) they are not
satisfied; each the flesh of his (own) arm they
devour: 21.&nbsp;Manasseh Ephraim, and Ephraim
Manasseh, (and) together they (are) against
Judah. For all this His wrath is not turned
back, and still His hand (is) stretched out.</p>

<p>X.&mdash;1. Woe unto them that decree decrees
of injustice, and that write oppression which
they have prescribed; 2.&nbsp;to turn aside from
judgment the weak, the right of the poor of
my people, that widows may be their spoil,
and the fatherless they plunder. 3.&nbsp;And
what will ye do in the day of visitation, and
in the ruin (which) shall come from far? To
whom will you flee for help, and where will
you leave your glory? 4.&nbsp;It does not bow
beneath the prisoners, and (yet) they shall fall
beneath the slain. For all this His wrath is
not turned back, and still His hand is stretched
out.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="tdc"><span class="smcap">the sin and the doom of assyria.&mdash;chap. x. 5&ndash;34.</span></p>

<p>5. Woe unto Asshur, the rod of My anger,
and the staff in their hand is My indignation.
6.&nbsp;Against an impious nation will I send him
and against the people of My wrath I will
commission him, to take spoil and to seize
pray, and to render it a trampling, like the
mire of streets. 7.&nbsp;And he not so will think,
and his heart so will think; for to destroy
(is) in his heart, and to cut off nations not a
few. 8.&nbsp;For he says, Are not my princes
altogether kings? 9.&nbsp;Is not Calno like Carchemish?
or (is) not Hamath like Arpad? or
(is) not Samaria like Damascus? 10.&nbsp;As my
hand hath found the idol-kingdoms, and their
images (more) than (those of) Jerusalem and
Samaria, 11.&nbsp;shall I not, as I have done to
Samaria and her idols, so do to Jerusalem and
her gods?</p>

<p>12. And it shall be that the Lord will cut
all His work short of mount Zion and at
Jerusalem. (Yes, even there) will I visit on
the fruit of the greatness of heart of the king
of Assyria, and on the ostentation of his
loftiness of eyes. 13.&nbsp;For he saith, By the
strength of my hand I have done (all this),
and by my wisdom, for I am wise, and I
remove the bounds of the nations, and rob
their hoards, and bring down, like a mighty
man (as I am), the inhabitants. 14.&nbsp;My hand
has found the strength of the nations, and like
the gathering of eggs forsaken, so have I
gathered all the earth, and there was none
<span class="pagenum" id="pA13L">[p.&nbsp;A13L]</span>
that moved a wing, or opened a mouth, or
chirped.</p>

<p>15. Shall the axe glorify itself above the
(person) hewing with it? Or shall the saw
magnify itself above the (person) handling
it? (This is indeed) like a rod&rsquo;s wielding
those who wield it, like a staff&rsquo;s lifting
(that which is) no wood. 16.&nbsp;Therefore the
Lord, the Lord of hosts, will send upon his
fat ones leanness, and under his glory shall
burn like the burning of fire. 17.&nbsp;And the
light of Israel shall be for a fire, and his Holy
One for a flame, and it shall burn and devour
his thorns and briers in one day. 18.&nbsp;And the
glory of his forest and his fruitful field, from
soul to body, will He consume, and it shall be
like the wasting away of a sick man. 19.&nbsp;And
the rest of the trees of the forest shall be few,
and a child shall write them.</p>

<p>20. And it shall come to pass in that day,
that the remnant of Israel, and the escaped of
the house of Jacob, shall no longer continue
to lean upon their smiter, but shall lean
upon Jehovah, the Holy One of Israel,
in truth. 21.&nbsp;A remnant shall return, a
remnant of Jacob to God Almighty. 22.&nbsp;For
though thy people, O Israel, shall be like the
sand of the sea, (only) a remnant of them shall
return. A consumption is decreed, overflowing
(with) righteousness. 23.&nbsp;For a consumption
even (the one) determined, (is) the Lord,
Jehovah of hosts, making in the midst of all
the earth.</p>

<p>24. Therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah
of hosts, Be not afraid, O my people inhabiting
Zion, of Asshur. He shall smite thee
with the rod, and shall lift up his staff upon
thee in the way of Egypt. 25.&nbsp;For yet a very
little, and wrath is at an end, and my anger
(shall go forth) to their destruction; 26.&nbsp;and
Jehovah of hosts shall raise up against him a
scourge like the smiting of Midian at the
rock Oreb, and His rod (shall again) be over
the sea, and He shall lift it up in the way of
Egypt. 27.&nbsp;And it shall be in that day,
(that) his burden shall depart from thy
shoulder, and his yoke from thy neck, and
the yoke shall be destroyed because of
oil.</p>

<p>28. He is come to Aiath&mdash;he is passed
to Migron&mdash;to Michmash he entrusts his
baggage. 29.&nbsp;They have passed the pass&mdash;in
Geba they have taken up their lodging&mdash;Ramah
trembles; Gibeah of Saul flees.
30.&nbsp;Cry aloud, daughter Gallim; hearken Laishah,
(ah) poor Anathoth! 31.&nbsp;Madmenah, wanders;
the inhabitants of Gebim flee.
32.&nbsp;Yet to-day in Nob (he is) to stand; (and
there) will he shake his hand against the
mountain of the house of Zion, the hill of
Jerusalem.</p>

<p>33. Behold, the Lord, Jehovah of hosts, (is)
lopping the branch with terror, and the trees
(shall be) felled, and the lofty ones brought
low. 34.&nbsp;And He shall cut down the thickets
of the forest with iron, and this Lebanon by

his roots shall grow. 2.&nbsp;And upon Him shall
rest the Spirit of Jehovah, a spirit of wisdom
and understanding, a spirit of counsel and
strength, a spirit of knowledge and of the
fear of Jehovah. 3.&nbsp;And His sense of smelling
(shall be exercised) in the fear of Jehovah,
and not by the sight of His eyes shall He
judge, and not by the hearing of His ears
shall He decide; 4.&nbsp;and He shall judge in
righteousness the weak, and do justice with
equity to the meek of the earth; and shall
smite the earth with the rod of His mouth,
and with the breath of His lips shall slay the
wicked. 5.&nbsp;And righteousness shall be the

girdle of His reins.</p>

and the leopard shall lie down with the kid,
and the calf and young lion and fatling

together shall their young lie down, and the
lion like the ox shall eat straw; 8.&nbsp;and the
suckling child shall play on the hole of the

weaned child stretch its hand. 9.&nbsp;They shall
not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain,

<p>10. And in that day shall the root of
Jesse which is set up be for a signal to the
nations: unto Him shall the Gentiles seek,
and His rest shall be glorious.</p>

<p>11. And it shall come to pass in that day,
the Lord shall add His hand a second time
to redeem the remnants of His people from
Assyria, and from Egypt, and from Pathros,
and from Cush, and from Elam, and from
Shinar, and from Hamath, and from the
islands of the sea. 12.&nbsp;And He shall set up
a signal to the nations, and shall gather the
outcasts of Israel, and the dispersed of Judah
shall He bring together from the four wings
of the earth. 13.&nbsp;And the army of Ephraim
shall depart, and the enemies of Judah shall
be cut off. Ephraim shall not envy Judah, and
Judah shall not vex Ephraim. 14.&nbsp;And they
shall fly upon the shoulder of the Philistines
towards the sea; together they shall spoil the
sons of the East; Edom and Moab the stretching
out of their hand, and the children of
Ammon their obedience. 15.&nbsp;And Jehovah
will destroy the tongue of the sea of Egypt,
and He will wave His hand over the river, in
the violence of His wind, and smite it into
seven streams, and make (His people) tread
(it) in shoes. 16.&nbsp;And there shall be a highway
for the remnant of His people which shall
be left, from Assyria, as there was for Israel

have called (forth) My mighty ones for (the

tumult of kingdoms of nations gathered!

Gomorrah. 20.&nbsp;It shall not be inhabited for
ever, and it shall not be dwelt in from generation
to generation, neither shall the Arab
pitch tent there, neither shall shepherds
cause their flocks to lie there. 21.&nbsp;But there
shall lie down desert creatures, and their
houses shall be filled with howls (or yells),
and there shall dwell the daughters of the
ostrich, and shaggy beasts shall gambol
there. 22.&nbsp;And wolves shall howl in his
palaces, and jackals in the temples of pleasure.
And near to come is her time, and her days
shall not be prolonged.</p>

<p>XIV.&mdash;1. For Jehovah will pity Jacob, and
will still choose Israel and cause them to rest
on their (own) land, and the stranger shall
be joined to them, and they shall be attached
to the house of Jacob. 2.&nbsp;And nations shall
take them and bring them to their place,
and the house of Israel shall take possession
of them on Jehovah&rsquo;s land for male and
female servants&mdash;and (thus) they shall be
captors of their captors, and rule over their
oppressors. 3.&nbsp;And it shall be in the day of
Jehovah&rsquo;s causing thee to rest from thy toil,
and from thy commotion, and from the hard
service which was wrought by thee, 4.&nbsp;that
thou shalt raise this song over the king of
Babylon, and say&mdash;</p>

<p>How hath the oppressor ceased, and the
golden (city) ceased! 5.&nbsp;Jehovah hath
broken the staff of the wicked, the rod of the
rulers, 6.&nbsp;smiting nations in anger by a stroke
without cessation, ruling nations in wrath by
a rule without restraint. 7.&nbsp;At rest, quiet,
is the whole earth. They burst forth into
singing. 8.&nbsp;And the cypresses rejoice with
respect to thee, the cedars of Lebanon
(saying), Now that thou art fallen, the feller
shall not come up against us.</p>

<p>9. Hell from beneath is moved for thee,
to meet thee at thy coming; it rouses for
thee the giants, all the chief ones of the
earth; it raises from their thrones all the
kings of the nations. 10.&nbsp;All of them shall
answer and say to thee, Thou also art made
weak as we, to us are likened! 11.&nbsp;Down to
the grave is brought thy pride, the music of
thy harps: under thee is spread the worm,
thy covering is vermin. 12.&nbsp;How art thou
fallen from heaven, Lucifer, son of the morning!
felled to the ground, thou that didst
lord it over the nations! 13.&nbsp;And (yet) thou
hadst said in thy heart, The heavens will I
<span class="pagenum" id="pA17L">[p.&nbsp;A17L]</span>
mount; above the stars of God will I raise
my throne; and I will sit in the mount of
meeting, in the sides of the north; 14.&nbsp;I will
mount above the cloud-heights; I will make
myself like the Most High. 15.&nbsp;But thou
shalt only be brought down to hell, to the
depths of the pit. 16.&nbsp;Those seeing thee shall
gaze at thee, they shall look at thee attentively,
(and say), Is this the man that made the earth
shake, that made kingdoms tremble,
17.&nbsp;made a world like a desert, destroyed its
cities, and its captives did not set free homewards?
18.&nbsp;All kings of nations, all of them,
lie in state, each in his house; 19.&nbsp;and thou
art cast out from thy grave&mdash;like a despised
branch, the raiment of the slain, pierced with
the sword, going down to the stones of the
pit, like a trampled carcass. 20.&nbsp;Thou shalt
not be joined with them in burial, because thy
land thou hast destroyed, thy people thou hast
slain. Let the seed of evil-doers be named no
more for ever.</p>

<p>21. Prepare for his sons a slaughter, for
the iniquity of their fathers. Let them not
arise and possess the earth, and fill the face of
the world with cities. 22.&nbsp;And I (Myself)
will rise up against them, saith Jehovah of
hosts, and will cut off from Babylon name,
and remnant, and progeny, and offspring,
saith Jehovah. 23.&nbsp;And I will render it a
possession of the porcupine, and pools of
water, and will sweep it with the broom of
destruction.</p>

<p>24. Jehovah of hosts hath sworn, saying,
Surely as I have planned, it shall come to pass,
and as I have devised it shall stand; 25.&nbsp;to
break Assyria in My land, and on My mountains
I will trample him; and his yoke shall
depart from off them, and his burden from off
his back shall depart. 26.&nbsp;This is the purpose
that is purposed upon all the earth, and
this the hand that is stretched out over all the
nations. 27.&nbsp;For Jehovah of hosts hath
purposed, and who shall annul? And His
hand the one stretched out, and who shall
turn it back?</p>

<p>28. In the year of the death of King Ahaz,
was this burden.</p>

<p>29. Rejoice not, O Philistia, all of thee,
because the rod that smote thee is broken, for
out of the root of the serpent shall come forth
a basilisk, and its fruit a fiery flying serpent.
30.&nbsp;And the first-born of the poor shall feed,
and the needy in security lie down, and I will
kill thy root with famine, and thy remnant it
shall slay.</p>

<p>31. Howl, O gate! cry, O city! dissolved,
O Philistia, is the whole of thee; for out of
the north a smoke comes, and there is no
straggler in his forces. 32.&nbsp;And what shall
one answer to the ambassadors of a nation?
That Jehovah has founded Zion, and in it the
afflicted of His people shall seek refuge.</p>

<p class="tdc"><span class="smcap">the downfall of moab.&mdash;chaps. xv., xvi.</span></p>

<p>1. (This is) the burden of Moab, That in a
night Ar-Moab is laid waste, is destroyed;
that in a night Kir-Moab is laid waste, is
destroyed. 2.&nbsp;They go up to the house, and
Dibon (to) the high places for weeping. On
Nebo and on Medeba Moab howls, and all
heads baldness, every beard cut off. 3.&nbsp;In
its streets, they are girded with sackcloth;
on its roofs and in its squares all of it howls,
coming down with weeping. 4.&nbsp;And Heshbon
cries and Eleaich&mdash;even to Jahaz is their voice
heard; therefore the warriors of Moab cry,
his soul is distress in him. 5.&nbsp;My heart for
Moab cries out; her fugitives (are fled) as far
as Zoar&mdash;an heifer of three years old; for he
that goes up Luhith with weeping goes up
by it, for in the way of Horonaim a cry of
destruction they lift up. 6.&nbsp;For the waters
of Nimrim (are and) shall be desolations: for
withered is the grass, gone is the herbage,
verdure there is none. 7.&nbsp;Therefore the
remainder of what each one has made, (and
their) hoard, over the brook of the willows
they carry them away. 8.&nbsp;For the cry goes
round the border of Moab; even to Eglaim
(is) its howling (heard), and to Beer-Elim its
howling. 9.&nbsp;For the waters of Dimon are full
of blood; and I will bring upon Dimon additions,
on the escaped of Moab a lion; and on
the remnant of it.</p>

<p>XVI.&mdash;1. Send ye the lamb to the ruler of
the land from Sela to the wilderness, to the
mountain of the daughter of Zion. 2.&nbsp;And
it shall come to pass like a bird wandering,
(like) a nest cast out, shall be the daughters
of Moab, the fords of Arnon. 3.&nbsp;[Alexander
omits the <i>translation</i> of this verse, but comments
on it.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.] 4.&nbsp;Let my outcasts, Moab,
sojourn with thee; be thou a covert to them
from the face of the spoiler: for the extortioner
is at an end, oppression has ceased,
consumed are the tramplers out of the land.
5.&nbsp;And a throne shall be established in
mercy; and one shall sit upon it in truth
in the tent of David, judging and seeking
justice, and prompt in equity.</p>

<p>6. We have heard of the pride of Moab, the
very proud, his haughtiness, and his pride,
and his wrath, the falsehood of his pretensions.
7.&nbsp;Therefore Moab shall howl for
Moab; all of it shall howl; for the grapes of
Kir-hareseth shall ye sigh, altogether smitten.
8.&nbsp;For the fields of Heshbon are withered&mdash;the
vine of Sibmah&mdash;the lords of the nations
broke down its choice plants&mdash;unto Jazer they
reached&mdash;they strayed into the desert&mdash;its
branches&mdash;they were stretched out&mdash;they
reached to the sea. 9.&nbsp;Therefore I will weep
with the weeping of Jazer (for) the vine of
Sibmah. I will wet thee (with) my tears,
Heshbon and (thee) Elealeh! for upon thy
fruit and thy harvest a cry has fallen.
10.&nbsp;And taken away is joy and gladness from the
fruitful field: and in the vineyards shall no
<span class="pagenum" id="pA19L">[p.&nbsp;A19L]</span>
(more) be sung, no (more) be shouted; wine
in the presses shall the treader not tread; the
cry have I stilled. 11.&nbsp;Therefore my bowels
for Moab like the harp shall sound, and my
inwards for Kirhares. 12.&nbsp;And it shall come
to pass, when Moab has appeared (before his
gods), when he has wearied himself (with vain
oblations) on the high place, then he shall
enter into his sanctuary to pray, and shall not
be able (to obtain an answer).</p>

<p>13. This is the word which Jehovah spake
concerning Moab of old. 14.&nbsp;And now Jehovah
speaks, saying, In three years, like the
years of an hireling, the glory of Moab, shall be
disgraced, with all the great throng, and the
remnant shall be small, and few, not much.</p>

<p class="tdc"><span class="smcap">the doom of the enemies of judah.&mdash;chaps. xvii., xviii.</span></p>

<p>XVII.&mdash;1. The burden of Damascus.</p>

<p>Behold, Damascus is removed from (being) a
city, and is a heap, a ruin. 2.&nbsp;Forsaken are
the cities of Aroer; for flocks shall they be,
and they shall lie down, and there shall be
no one making (them) afraid. 3.&nbsp;Then shall
cease defence for Ephraim and royalty from
Damascus and the rest of Syria. Like the
glory of the children of Israel shall they be,
with Jehovah of hosts.</p>

<p>4. And it shall come to pass in that day, the
glory of Jacob shall be brought low, and the
fatness of his flesh shall be made lean.
5.&nbsp;And it shall be as one gathers the harvest, the
standing corn, and his arm reaps the ears.
And it shall be like one collecting ears in the
valley of Rephaim. 6.&nbsp;And gleanings shall be
left therein like the shaking of an olive-tree,
two (or) three berries in the top of a high
bough, four (or) five in the branches of the
fruit-tree, saith Jehovah, God of Israel.</p>

<p>7. In that day man shall turn to his Maker,
and his eyes to the Holy One of Israel shall
look. 8.&nbsp;And he shall not turn to the altars,
the work of his own hands, and that which
his own fingers have made shall he not regard,
and the groves of Ashtoreth and the pillars of
the sun.</p>

<p>9. In that day shall his fortified cities by
like what is left in the thickets and the lofty
branch, which they leave (as they retire) from
before the children of Israel, and (the land)
shall be a waste. 10.&nbsp;Because thou hast forgotten
the God of thy salvation, and the rock
of thy strength hast not remembered, therefore
thou wilt plant plants of pleasantness,
and with a strange slip set it. 11.&nbsp;In the day
of thy planting thou wilt hedge it in, and in
the morning thou wilt make thy seed to blossom,
(but) away flies the crop in a day of grief
and desperate sorrow.</p>

<p>12. Hark! the noise of many nations! Like
the noise of the sea they make a noise. And
the rush of peoples! Like the rush of many
waters they are rushing. 13.&nbsp;Nations, like
the rush of many waters, rush; and he rebukes
<span class="pagenum" id="pA20L">[p.&nbsp;A20L]</span>
it, and it flees from afar, and is chased
like the chaff of hills before a wind, and like
a rolling thing before a whirlwind. 14.&nbsp;At
evening-tide, and behold terror; before morning
he is not. This be the portion of our
plunderers, and the lot of our spoilers.</p>

<p>XVIII.&mdash;1. Ho! land of rustling wings,
which art beyond the rivers of Cush,
2.&nbsp;sending by sea ambassadors, and in vessels of
papyrus on the face of the waters. Go, ye
light messengers, to a nation drawn and shorn,
to a people terrible since it existed and onwards,
a nation of double strength and tramplings,
whose land the streams divide. 3.&nbsp;All
ye inhabitants of the world, and dwellers on
the earth, shall see as it were the raising of a
standard on the mountains, and shall hear as
it were the blowing of a trumpet.</p>

<p>4. For thus said Jehovah to me, I will rest
and look on in My dwelling-place, like a serene
heat upon herbs, like a cloud of dew in the
heat of harvest. 5.&nbsp;For before the harvest or
the bloom is finished, and the flower becomes
a ripening grape, he cuts down the branches
with the pruning-knives, and the tendrils he
removes, he cuts away. 6.&nbsp;They shall be
left together to the wild birds of the mountains,
and to the wild beasts of the earth,
and the wild birds shall summer thereon, and
every wild beast of the earth thereon shall
winter.</p>

<p>7. At that time shall be brought a gift
to Jehovah of hosts, a people drawn out and
shorn, and from a people terrible since it hath
been and onward, a nation of double power and
trampling, whose land streams divide, to the
place of the name of Jehovah of hosts, mount

<p class="tdc"><span class="smcap">the burden of egypt.&mdash;chap. xix.</span></p>

<p>1. Behold! Jehovah riding on a light cloud,
and He comes to Egypt, and the idols of Egypt
move at His presence, and the heart of Egypt
melts within him. 2.&nbsp;And I will excite
Egypt against Egypt, and they shall fight, a
man with his brother, and a man with his
fellow, city with city, kingdom with kingdom.
3.&nbsp;And the spirit of Egypt shall be emptied
out in the midst thereof, and the counsel
thereof I will swallow up, and they will seek
to the idols, and to the mutterers, and to the
familiar spirits, and to the wizards. 4.&nbsp;And
I will shut up Egypt in the hands of a hard
master, and a strong king shall rule over them,
saith the Lord Jehovah of hosts.</p>

<p>5. And the waters shall be dried up from
the sea, and the river shall fail and be dried
up. 6.&nbsp;And the rivers shall stink, the streams
of Egypt are emptied and dried up, reed and
rush sicken. 7.&nbsp;And meadows by the river, by
the mouth of the river, and all the sown ground
of the river, shall wither being driven away,
<span class="pagenum" id="pA21L">[p.&nbsp;A21L]</span>
and it is not. 8.&nbsp;And the fisherman shall
mourn, and they shall lament, all the throwers
of a hook into the river, and the spreaders of a
net upon the surface of the water, languish.
9.&nbsp;And ashamed are the workers of combed flax,
and the weavers of white (stuffs). 10.&nbsp;And her
pillars are broken down, all labourers for hire
are grieved at heart.</p>

<p>11. Entirely foolish are the princes of Zoan,
the sages of the counsellors of Pharaoh, (their)
counsel is become brutish. How can ye say
to Pharaoh, I am the son of wise (fathers), I
am the son of kings of old? 12.&nbsp;Where (are)
they? Where (are) thy wise men? Pray let
them tell thee, and (if that is too much) let
them (at least) know, what Jehovah of hosts
hath purposed concerning Egypt. 13.&nbsp;Infatuated
are the chiefs of Zoan, deceived are
the chiefs of Noph, and they have misled
Egypt, the corner-stone of her tribes.
14.&nbsp;Jehovah hath mingled in the midst of her a
spirit of confusion, and they have misled
Egypt in all its work, like the misleading of a
drunkard in his vomit. 15.&nbsp;And there shall
not be in Egypt a work which head and tail,
branch and rush, may do.</p>

<p>16. In that day shall Egypt be like women,
and shall fear and tremble from before the
shaking of the hand of Jehovah of hosts,
which He is shaking over it. 17.&nbsp;And the
land of Judah shall be for a terror unto Egypt,
every person to whom one mentions it shall
fear before the purpose of Jehovah of hosts,
which He is purposing against it.</p>

<p>18. In that day there shall be five cities in
the land of Egypt speaking the language of
Canaan, and swearing to Jehovah of hosts.
The city of destruction shall one be called.
19.&nbsp;In that day there shall be an altar to
Jehovah in the midst of the land, and a pillar
near the border to Jehovah. 20.&nbsp;And it shall
be for a sign and a testimony to Jehovah
of hosts in the land of Egypt, that they shall
cry to Jehovah from the presence of oppressors,
and He will send them a deliverer and a mighty
one, and save them. 21.&nbsp;And Jehovah shall
be known to Egypt, and Egypt shall know
Jehovah in that day, and shall serve with
sacrifice and offering, and shall vow a vow to
Jehovah, and perform it.</p>

<p>22. And Jehovah shall smite Egypt, smiting
and healing, and they shall return unto Jehovah,
and He shall be entreated of them, and
shall heal them. 23.&nbsp;In that day there shall
be a highway from Egypt to Assyria, and
Assyria shall come into Egypt and Egypt into
Assyria, and Egypt shall serve with Assyria.
24.&nbsp;In that day shall Israel be a third with
respect to Egypt and Assyria, a blessing in the
midst of the earth, 25.&nbsp;which Jehovah has
blessed, saying, Blessed be My people Egypt,
and the work of My hands Assyria, and My

Assyria lead the captivity of Egypt and the
exiles of Ethiopia, young and old, naked and
barefoot, with their buttocks uncovered, the

All sighing have I made to cease. 3.&nbsp;Therefore

waste, no house, no entrance; from the land
of Chittim it is revealed to them. 2.&nbsp;Be
silent, O inhabitants of the isle, the merchants
of Sidon crossing the sea filled thee. 3.&nbsp;And
in great waters (was) the seed of the Nile;
the harvest of the river (was) her revenue;
and she was a mart of nations. 5.&nbsp;When the

howl, ye inhabitants of the isle. 7.&nbsp;Is this
your joyous city? From the days of old is
her antiquity; her feet shall carry her afar
off to sojourn.</p>

<p>8. Who hath purposed this against Tyre
the crowning (city), whose merchants (are)
princes, her traffickers the honoured of the
earth? 9.&nbsp;Jehovah of hosts hath purposed it,
to profane the elevation of all beauty, to

degrade all the honoured of the earth.
10.&nbsp;Pass through thy land like the river; daughter
of Tarshish, there is no girdle (any) longer.
11.&nbsp;His hand He stretched out over the
sea; He made kingdoms tremble; Jehovah
commanded respecting Canaan to destroy her
strongholds. 12.&nbsp;And He said, Thou shalt not
continue to triumph, violated virgin daughter
of Zidon; to Chittim arise, pass over; there
also there shall be no rest to thee. 13.&nbsp;Behold
the land of the Chaldees; this people
was not; Assyria founded it for dwellers in
the wilderness; they have set up his towers;
they have roused up her palaces; he has rendered
it a ruin. 14.&nbsp;Howl, ships of Tarshish,

Tyre, and she shall return with all the kingdoms of

give rest to the weary, and this is quiet, but

We have made a covenant with death, and
with hell have formed a league; the overflowing
scourge, when it passes through, shall
not come upon us, for we have made falsehood
our refuge, and in fraud we have hid ourselves;
16.&nbsp;therefore, thus saith the Lord
Jehovah, Behold I lay in Zion a stone, a stone
of proof, a corner-stone of value, of a firm
foundation; the builder will not be in haste.
17.&nbsp;And I will place judgment for a line and
justice for a plummet, and hail shall sweep
away the refuge of falsehood, and the hiding-place
waters shall overflow. 18.&nbsp;And your
covenant with death shall be annulled, and
your league with hell shall not stand, and the
overflowing scourge&mdash;for it shall pass through,
and ye shall be for it to trample on. 19.&nbsp;And
as soon as it passes through, it shall carry you
away; for every morning it shall pass through,
in the day and in the night, and only vexation
shall be the understanding of the thing
heard. 20.&nbsp;For the bed is too short to stretch
one&rsquo;s self, and the covering too narrow to
wrap one&rsquo;s self. 21.&nbsp;For like mount Perazim
shall Jehovah rise up, like the valley in Gibeon,
shall He rage, to do His work, His strange
work, and to perform His task, His strange
task. 22.&nbsp;And now scoff not, lest your bands
be strong; for even a decreed consumption I
have heard from the Lord Jehovah of hosts,

plough every day to sow? Does he open

when he has levelled the surface of it, cast
abroad dill, and scatter cummin, and set
wheat in rows, and barley (in the place)
<span class="pagenum" id="pA31L">[p.&nbsp;A31L]</span>

27.&nbsp;For not with sledge must dill be
threshed, or the cart wheel turned upon
cummin; for with the stick must dill be

for us right things: speak unto us smooth
things, view deceits, 11.&nbsp;depart from the way,
sever from the path, cause to cease from before
us the Holy One of Israel. 12.&nbsp;Therefore,
thus saith the Holy One of Israel, Because
of your rejecting this word, and (because)
ye have trusted in oppression and perverseness
and have relied thereon, 13.&nbsp;therefore shall
their iniquity be to you like a breach ready to
fall, swelling out in a high wall, whose breaking
may come suddenly, at (any) instant.
14.&nbsp;And it is broken like the breaking of a potter&rsquo;s
vessel, broken unsparingly, so that there
is not found among its fragments a sherd to
take up fire from a hearth, and to dip up water
from a pool. 15.&nbsp;For thus saith the Lord
Jehovah, the Holy One of Israel, In returning
and rest shall ye be saved, in remaining quiet
and in confidence shall be your strength; and
ye would not. 16.&nbsp;And ye said, No, for we
will flee upon horses; therefore shall ye flee;
and upon swift will we ride; therefore
shall your pursuers be swift. 17.&nbsp;One thousand
shall flee from before the menace of one,
from before the rebuke of five shall ye flee,
until ye are left like a pole on the top of the
mountain, and like the signal on the hill.
18.&nbsp;And therefore will Jehovah wait to have
mercy upon you, and therefore will He rise
up to pity you, for a God of judgment is
Jehovah; blessed are all that wait for Him.
19.&nbsp;For the people in Zion shall dwell in Jerusalem;
thou shalt weep no more; He will be
very gracious unto thee at the voice of thy
cry; as He hears it He will answer thee.
20.&nbsp;And the Lord will give you bread of affliction
and water of oppression, and no more shall
thy teachers hide themselves, and thine eyes
shall see thy teachers. 21.&nbsp;And thine ears
shall hear a voice from behind thee, saying,
This is the way, walk ye in it, when ye turn
to the right and when ye turn to the left.
22.&nbsp;And ye shall defile the covering of thy
idols of silver and the case of thy image of
gold; thou shalt scatter them as an abominable
thing. Away! shalt thou say to it.
23.&nbsp;And He shall give the rain of thy seed,
with which thou shalt sow the ground, and
bread, the produce of the ground, and it
shall be fat and rich; thy cattle shall feed
that day in an enlarged pasture. 24.&nbsp;And
the oxen and the asses working the ground
shall eat salted provender which has been
winnowed with the sieve and fan. 25.&nbsp;And
there shall be, on every high mountain, and
on every elevated hill, channels, streams of
waters, in the day of great slaughter, when
towers fall. 26.&nbsp;And the light of the moon
shall be as the light of the sun, and the light
of the sun shall be sevenfold, as the light of
seven days, in the day of Jehovah&rsquo;s binding
<span class="pagenum" id="pA34L">[p.&nbsp;A34L]</span>
up the breach of His people, and the stroke
of His wound He will heal.</p>

<p>27. Behold, the name of Jehovah cometh
from afar, burning His anger, and heavy the
ascent (of smoke); His lips are full of wrath,
and His tongue as a devouring fire. 28.&nbsp;And
His breath, like an overflowing stream, shall
divide as far as the neck, to sift the nations in
the sieve of falsehood, and a misleading bridle
on the jaws of the people. 29.&nbsp;Your song shall
be like the night of the consecration of a
feast, and your joy shall be like (that of) one
marching with the pipe to go into the
mountain of Jehovah, to the Rock of Israel.
30.&nbsp;And Jehovah shall cause to be heard the
majesty of His voice, and the descent of His
arm shall He cause to be seen, with indignation
of anger and a flame of devouring fire,
scattering, and rain, and hailstones. 31.&nbsp;For
at the voice of Jehovah shall Assyria be
broken, with the rod shall He smite. 32.&nbsp;And
every passage of the rod of doom, which
Jehovah shall lay upon him, shall be with
tabrets and harps, and with fights of shaking
it is fought therein. 33.&nbsp;Not arranged since
yesterday is Tophet: even for the king it is
prepared; He has deepened, He has widened
(it); its pile fire and wood in plenty; the
breath of Jehovah, like a stream of brimstone,
kindles it.</p>

<p>XXXI.&mdash;1. Woe to those going down to
Egypt for help, and on horses they rely and
trust in cavalry, because it is numerous, and
on horsemen, because they are very strong,
and they look not to the Holy One of Israel,
and Jehovah they seek not. 2.&nbsp;And (yet) He
too is wise, and brings evil, and His words
He removes not, and He rises up against the
house of evil-doers, and against the help of
the workers of iniquity. 3.&nbsp;And Egypt (is)
man, and their horses flesh and not spirit:
and Jehovah shall stretch out His hand, and
the helper shall stumble, and the helped fall,
and together all of them shall cease.</p>

<p>4. For thus saith Jehovah unto me, As a
lion growls, and a young lion over his prey,
against whom a multitude of shepherds is
called forth, at their voice he is not frightened,
and at their noise he is not humbled, so will
Jehovah of hosts come down, to fight upon
mount Zion and upon her hill. 5.&nbsp;As birds
flying (over or around their nests), so will
Jehovah cover over Jerusalem, cover and
rescue, pass over and save.</p>

<p>6. Return unto Him from whom the
children of Israel have deeply revolted.
<span class="pagenum" id="pA35L">[p.&nbsp;A35L]</span>
7.&nbsp;For in that day they shall reject, a man his
idols of silver and his idols of gold, which
your sinful hands have made for you [or,
which your own hands have made for you as
sin]. 8.&nbsp;And Assyria shall fall by no man&rsquo;s
sword, and no mortal&rsquo;s work shall devour him,
and he shall flee from before the sword, and
his young men shall become tributary.
9.&nbsp;And his rock from fear shall pass away, and
his chiefs shall be afraid of a standard, saith
Jehovah, to whom there is a fire in Zion and
a furnace in Jerusalem.</p>

shalt be spoiled, and when thou art done

favour us, for on Thee we wait; be their

(or, tumultuous noise) the people flee; at Thy

He shall be the security of thy times, strength

8.&nbsp;The highways are wasted, the wayfarer ceaseth;
he breaks the covenant, despises cities, values

Lebanon is ashamed, it pines away; Sharon

of lime); thorns cut up, in the fire they
shall burn. 13.&nbsp;Hear, ye far, what I have
done, and know, ye near, my might.</p>

<p>14. Afraid in Zion are the sinners; trembling
has seized the impious. Who of us can
dwell with the devouring fire, who of us can
dwell with everlasting burnings? 15.&nbsp;Walking
righteousnesses, and speaking right things,
rejecting with contempt the gain of oppressions

fulness, the world and all its issues. 2.&nbsp;For
Jehovah is angry against all the nations, and
has wrath against all their host; He has
doomed them, He has given them to the

out, and their carcasses, their stench shall go
up; and mountains shall be melted with their

like a scroll, and all their host shall fade like
the fading of a leaf from off a vine, and like

<p>5. For My sword is steeped in heaven; behold,
upon Edom shall it come down, and
upon the people of My curse. 6.&nbsp;Jehovah has
a sword; it is full of blood, it is smeared with
fat, with the blood of lambs and goats, with
the fat of the kidneys of rams; for Jehovah
has a sacrifice in Bozrah, and a great slaughter
in the land of Edom. 7.&nbsp;And unicorns shall
come down with them, and bullocks with
blood, and their dust with fat shall be fattened.
8.&nbsp;For there is a day of vengeance to Jehovah,

9.&nbsp;And her streams shall be turned to pitch,

13.&nbsp;And in her palaces shall come up thorns,
nettles, and brambles in her fortresses; and
she shall be a home of wolves, a grass-plot
for ostriches. 14.&nbsp;And wild creatures shall
(there) meet with howling creatures, and the
shaggy monster shall call to his fellow; only
there reposes the night-monster, and finds
for herself a resting place. 15.&nbsp;[As to the
particular species of animals referred to in
this whole passage, there is no need, as Calvin
well observes, of troubling ourselves much
about them. The general sense evidently is,
that a human population should be succeeded
by wild and lonely animals, who should not
only live but breed there, implying total and
continued desolation.] 16.&nbsp;Seek ye out of the
book of Jehovah and read; by number will
Jehovah call them. For My mouth, it has
commanded; and His Spirit it has gathered

<p>XXXVI.&mdash;1. And it came to pass in the
fourteenth year of king Hezekiah, Sennacherib
king of Assyria came up against all
the fenced cities of Judah, and took them.
2.&nbsp;And the king of Assyria sent Rabshakeh from
Lachish to Jerusalem, to king Hezekiah,
with a strong force, and he stood by the
aqueduct of the upper pool, in the highway of
the fuller&rsquo;s field. 3.&nbsp;Then there came forth
Eliakim, Hilkiah&rsquo;s son, who was over the
house, and Shebna the scribe, and Joah,
Asaph&rsquo;s son, the recorder.</p>

<p>4. And Rabshakeh said to them: say now
to Hezekiah, Thus saith the great king, the
king of Assyria, What is this confidence
which thou confidest in? 5.&nbsp;I say, mere word
of lips (is your) counsel and strength for the
war; now on whom hast thou confided, that
thou hast rebelled against me? 6.&nbsp;Behold,
thou hast trusted in the support of this broken
reed, in Egypt, which, (if) a man lean upon it,
will go into his hand and pierce it; so is
Pharaoh king of Egypt to all those trusting
in him. 7.&nbsp;And if thou say to me, We trust
in Jehovah our God; is it not He whose high
places and whose altars Hezekiah hath taken
away, and said to Judah and Jerusalem, Before
this altar shall ye worship? 8.&nbsp;And now,
engage, I pray thee, with my lord the king of
Assyria, and I will give thee two thousand
horses, if thou be able on thy part to set riders
upon them. 9.&nbsp;And how wilt thou turn away
the face of one governor of the least of my
master&rsquo;s servants? So hast thou reposed thyself
on Egypt, with respect to chariots and
horses. 10.&nbsp;And now (is it) without Jehovah
I have come up against this land to destroy
it? Jehovah said to me, Go up against this
land and destroy it.</p>

<p>11. Then said Eliakim, and Shebna, and
Joah, unto Rabshakeh, Pray speak unto thy
servants in Aramean, for we understand (it),
and speak not unto us in Jewish, in the ears
of the people who (are) on the wall.</p>

<p>12. And Rabshakeh said: Is it to thy master
and to thee that my master sent me to speak
these words? Is it not to the men sitting on
the wall to eat their own dung and to drink
their own water with you?</p>

<p>13. Then Rabshakeh stood and called with
a loud voice in Jewish, and said, Hear the
words of the great king, the king of Assyria.
14.&nbsp;Thus saith the king: Let not Hezekiah
deceive you, for he will not be able to deliver
you. 15.&nbsp;And let not Hezekiah make you
trust in Jehovah, saying, Jehovah will certainly
save us, this city shall not be given up
<span class="pagenum" id="pA40L">[p.&nbsp;A40L]</span>
into the hand of the king of Assyria,
16.&nbsp;Hearken not to Hezekiah, for thus saith the
king of Assyria, Make with me a blessing,
and come out unto me, and eat ye (every) man
his own vine and (every) man his own fig-tree,
and drink ye (every) man the waters of his own
cistern; 17.&nbsp;until I come and take you away
to a land like your own land, a land of corn
and wine, a land of bread and vineyards.
18.&nbsp;Let not Hezekiah seduce you, saying Jehovah
will deliver us. Have the gods of the nations
delivered every one his land out of the hand
of the king of Assyria? 19.&nbsp;Where (are) the
gods of Hamath and Arpad? where the gods
of Sepharvaim? and (when or where was it)
that they delivered Samaria out of my hand?
20.&nbsp;Who (are they) among all the gods of
these lands that have delivered their land
out of my hand, that Jehovah should deliver
Jerusalem out of my hand?</p>

<p>21. And they held their peace, and did not
answer him a word, for such was the commandment
of the king, Ye shall not answer
him.</p>

<p>22. Then came Eliakim, Hilkiah&rsquo;s son, who
(was) over the house, and Shebna the scribe,
and Joah, Asaph&rsquo;s son, the recorder, unto
Hezekiah, with their clothes rent, and told
him the words of Rabshakeh.</p>

<p>XXXVII.&mdash;1. And it came to pass when
king Hezekiah heard, that he rent his clothes,
and covered himself with sackcloth, and went
into the house of Jehovah. 2.&nbsp;And he sent
Eliakim who was over the household, and
Shebna the scribe, and the elders of the people
covered with sackcloth, unto Isaiah the son
of Amoz, the prophet. 3.&nbsp;And they said unto
him, Thus saith Hezekiah, A day of anguish
and rebuke and contempt (is) this day, for the
children are come to the places of birth, and
there is not strength to bring forth. 4.&nbsp;If
peradventure Jehovah thy God will hear the
words of Rabshakeh, whom the king of Assyria
his master hath sent to reproach the living
God, and will rebuke the words which Jehovah
thy God hath heard, then shalt thou lift up a
prayer for the remnant (that is still) found
(here).</p>

<p>5. And the servants of king Hezekiah came
to Isaiah. 6.&nbsp;And Isaiah said to them, Thus
shall ye say to your master, Thus saith Jehovah,
Be not afraid of the words which thou
hast heard, (with) which the servants of the
king of Assyria hath blasphemed me. 7.&nbsp;Behold,
I am putting a spirit in him, and he
shall hear a noise, and shall return to his own
land, and I will cause him to fall by the sword
in his own land.</p>

<p>8. And Rabshakeh returned, and found the
king of Assyria fighting against Libnah, for
he heard that he had decamped from Lachish.
<span class="pagenum" id="pA41L">[p.&nbsp;A41L]</span>
9.&nbsp;And he heard say concerning Tirhakah
king of Ethiopia, He is come forth to make
war with thee; and he heard (it), and sent
messengers to Hezekiah, saying, 10.&nbsp;Thus
shall ye say to Hezekiah, king of Judah, Let
not thy God deceive thee, in whom thou
trustest, saying, Jerusalem shall not be given
unto the hand of the king of Assyria.
11.&nbsp;Behold, thou hast heard what the kings of
Assyria have done to all the lands, by utterly
destroying them, and thou shalt be delivered!
12.&nbsp;Did the gods of the nations deliver them,
which my fathers destroyed, (to wit) Gozan,
and Haran, and Rezeph, and the children of
Eden which is in Telassar? 13.&nbsp;Where is the
king of Hamath, and the king of Arpad, and
the king of the city Sepharvaim, Henah, and
Ivrah?</p>

<p>14. And Hezekiah took the letter from the
hand of the messengers, and read it, and went
up (to) the house of Jehovah, and Hezekiah
spread it before Jehovah. 15.&nbsp;And Hezekiah
prayed to Jehovah, saying, 16.&nbsp;Jehovah of
hosts, God of Israel, dwelling between the
cherubim, Thou art He, the God, Thou alone,
to all the kingdoms of the earth; Thou hast
made the heavens and the earth. 17.&nbsp;Bow
down Thine ear, O Jehovah, and hear; open
Thine eyes, O Jehovah, and see; and hear all
the words of Sennacherib, which he hath sent
to reproach the living God. 18.&nbsp;It is true,
O Jehovah, the kings of Assyria have wasted
all the lands and their land, 19.&nbsp;and given
their gods into the fire&mdash;for they (were) no
gods, but wood and stone, the work of men&rsquo;s
hands&mdash;and destroyed them. 20.&nbsp;And now,
O Jehovah, our God, save us from his hand,
and all the kingdoms of the earth shall know
that Thou alone art Jehovah.</p>

<p>21. And Isaiah, the son of Amoz, sent to
Hezekiah, saying, Thus saith Jehovah, the
God of Israel, (as to) what thou has prayed to
the (with respect to) Sennacherib king of Assyria,
22.&nbsp;this is the word which Jehovah hath
spoken against him, The virgin daughter of
Zion hath despised thee, she hath laughed
thee to scorn, the daughter of Jerusalem hath
shaken her head after thee. 23.&nbsp;Who hast
thou reproached and reviled, and against whom
hast thou raised (thy) voice, and lifted thine
eyes (on) high towards the Holy One of Israel?
24.&nbsp;By the hand of thy servants hast thou
reproached the Lord and said, With the multitude
of my chariots I have ascended the
height of mountains, the sides of Lebanon,
and I will cut down the loftiness of its cedars
and the choice of its fire, and I will reach its
extreme height, its garden-forest. 25.&nbsp;I have
digged and drunk water, and I will dry up
with the sole of my feet all the streams of
Egypt. 26.&nbsp;Hast thou not heard? From afar
I have done it, from the days of old, and
formed it, now I have caused it to come, and
it shall be, to lay waste, (as) desolate heaps,
fortified cities. 27.&nbsp;And their inhabitants are
short of hand; they are broken and confounded;
they are grass of the field and green
<span class="pagenum" id="pA42L">[p.&nbsp;A42L]</span>
herbage, grass of the house-tops and a field
before the stalk. 28.&nbsp;And thy sitting down,
and thy going out, and thy coming in, I have
known, and thy raging against Me. 29.&nbsp;Because
of thy raging against Me, and (because)
thy arrogance has come up into My ears, I
will put My hook in thy nose, and My bridle
in thy lips, and I will cause thee to return by
the way by which thou camest.</p>

<p>30. And this to thee, the sign: eat, the
(present) year, that which groweth of itself,
and the second year that which springeth of
the same, and in the third year sow ye, and
reap, and plant vineyards, and eat the fruit
thereof. 31.&nbsp;And the escaped of the house of
Jacob, that is left, shall again take root downward
and bear fruit upward; 32.&nbsp;for out of
Jerusalem shall go forth a remnant, and an
escape from Mount Zion; the zeal of Jehovah
of hosts shall do this.</p>

<p>33. Therefore thus saith Jehovah (with
respect) to the king of Assyria, He shall not
come to this city, and shall not shoot an
arrow there, and shall not come before it with
a shield, and shall not cast up a mound against
it. 34.&nbsp;By the way that he came shall he
return, and to this city shall he not come,
saith Jehovah. 35.&nbsp;And I will cover over this
city, (so as) to save it, for My sake, and
for the sake of David My servant.</p>

<p>36. And the angel of the Lord went forth,
and smote in the camp of Assyria an hundred
and eighty and five thousand, and they rose
up early in the morning and behold all of
them were dead corpses. 37.&nbsp;Then decamped, and
departed, and returned, Sennacherib king of
Assyria, and dwelt in Nineveh. 38.&nbsp;And he was
worshipping (in) the house of Nisroch his god,
and Adrammelech and Sharezer his sons smote
him with the sword, and they escaped into
the land of Ararat, and Esarhaddon his son
reigned in his stead.</p>

<p>XXXVIII.&mdash;1. In those days Hezekiah was
sick unto death, and Isaiah the son of Amoz,
the prophet, came unto him, and said unto
him, Thus saith Jehovah, Order thy house, for
thou (art) dying, and art not to live. 2.&nbsp;And
Hezekiah turned his face to the wall, and
prayed to Jehovah. 3.&nbsp;And he said, Ah,
Jehovah, remember, I beseech Thee, how I
have walked before Thee in truth and with a
whole heart, and that which is good in Thine
eyes have I done; and Hezekiah wept a great
weeping.</p>

<p>4. And the word of Jehovah came to Isaiah,
saying, 5.&nbsp;Go and say to Hezekiah, Thus
saith Jehovah, the God of David thy father,
I have heard thy prayer, I have seen thy tears;
behold, I am adding unto thy days fifteen
years. 6.&nbsp;And out of the hand of the king of
Assyria I will save thee and this city, and I
will cover over this city.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="pA43L">[p.&nbsp;A43L]</span>
7. And this shall be to thee the sign from
Jehovah, that Jehovah will perform this word
which He hath spoken: 8.&nbsp;Behold, I am
causing the shadow to go back, the degree
which it has gone down on the degrees of
Ahaz with the sun, ten degrees backward;
and the sun returned ten degrees on the degrees
which it had gone down.</p>

<p>9. A writing of Hezekiah, king of Judah,
when he was sick, and recovered from his sickness:&mdash;</p>

<p>10. I said in the pause of my days, I shall
go into the gate of the grave, I am deprived
of the residue of my years. 11.&nbsp;I said I shall
not see Jah, Jah in the land of the living; I
shall not behold man again with the inhabitants
of the world. 12.&nbsp;My dwelling is
plucked up and uncovered by me like a
shepherd&rsquo;s tent. I have rolled up, like the
weaver, my life; from the thrum He will cut
me off; from day to night Thou wilt finish
me.</p>

<p>13. I set (Him before me) till the morning
as a lion (saying), So will He break all my
bones; from day to night Thou wilt make an
end of me. 14.&nbsp;Like a swallow (or) like a
twittering sparrow, so I chirp; I moan like a
dove; my eyes are weak (with looking) upward;
O Jehovah; I am oppressed, undertake
for me.</p>

<p>15. What shall I say? He hath both spoken
to me, and Himself hath done (it); I shall
go softly all my days in the bitterness of my
soul. 16.&nbsp;Lord, upon them they live, and as
to everything in them is the life of my spirit,
and Thou wilt recover me and make me to
live. 17.&nbsp;Behold to peace (is turned) my
bitter bitterness, and Thou hast loosed my soul
from the pit of destruction, because Thou hast
cast behind Thy back all my sins.</p>

<p>18. For the grave shall not confess Thee
(nor) death praise Thee; they that go down
to the pit shall not hope for Thy truth.
19.&nbsp;The living, the living, he shall thank Thee,
as I do to-day; fathers to sons shall make
known with respect to Thy truth. 20.&nbsp;Jehovah
(listened) to save me! And my songs we
will play, all the days of our life, at the house
of Jehovah.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="pA44L">[p.&nbsp;A44L]</span>
21. And Isaiah said, Let him take a lump
of figs, and lay them softened on the boil, and
he shall live. 22.&nbsp;And Hezekiah said, What
sign (is there) that I shall go up (to) the house
of Jehovah?</p>

<p>XXXIX.&mdash;1. In that time, Merodach Baladan,
son of Baladan, king of Babylon, sent
letters and a gift to Hezekiah, and he heard
that he was sick and was recovered.</p>

<p>2. And Hezekiah was glad of them, and
showed them his house of rarities, the silver,
and the gold, and the spices, and the ointment,
and all his house of arms, and all that was
found in his treasures; there was not a thing
which Hezekiah did not show them, in his
house, and in all his dominion.</p>

<p>3. Then came Isaiah the prophet to the
king Hezekiah, and said to him, What said
these men, and whence came they unto thee?
And Hezekiah said, From a far country came
they unto me, from Babylon. 4.&nbsp;And he
said, What have they seen in thy house? And
Hezekiah said, All that is in my house have
they seen; there is not a thing that I have
not showed them in my treasures.</p>

<p>5. And Isaiah said, Hear the word of Jehovah
of hosts, 6.&nbsp;Behold days are coming when
all that (is) in thy house, and that which thy
fathers have hoarded until this day, shall be
carried to Babylon; there shall not be left a
thing, saith Jehovah. 7.&nbsp;And of thy sons
that shall issue from thee, which thou shalt
begat, shall they take away, and they shall be
eunuchs in the palace of the king of Babylon.</p>

<p>8. And Hezekiah said, Good is the word of
Jehovah which thou hast spoken. And he
said, for there shall be peace and truth in
my days.</p>

<p>XL.&mdash;[A glorious change awaits the Church,
consisting in a new and gracious manifestation
of Jehovah&rsquo;s presence, for which His people
are exhorted to prepare, vers. 1&ndash;5. Though
one generation perish after another, this
promise shall eventually be fulfilled, because
it rests not upon human but Divine authority,
vers. 6&ndash;8. Zion may even now see Him
approaching as the conqueror of His enemies,
and at the same time as the shepherd of His
people, vers. 9&ndash;11. The fulfilment of these
pledges is insured by His infinite wisdom, His
Almighty power, and His independence both
of individuals and nations, vers. 12&ndash;17. How
much more is He superior to material images,
by which men represent Him or supply His
place, vers. 18&ndash;25. The same power which
supports the heavens is pledged for the support
of Israel, vers. 26&ndash;31.]</p>

<p>1. Comfort ye, comfort ye My people, saith
your God. 2.&nbsp;Speak to the heart of Jerusalem,
and cry to her that her warfare is
accomplished, that her iniquity is pardoned,
that she hath received from the hand of
Jehovah double for all her sins. 3.&nbsp;A voice
crying&mdash;in the wilderness&mdash;Clear the way of
<span class="pagenum" id="pA45L">[p.&nbsp;A45L]</span>
Jehovah&mdash;make straight in the desert a highway
for our God. 4.&nbsp;Every valley shall be
raised, and every mountain and hill brought
low, and the uneven shall become level, and
the ridges a plain. 5.&nbsp;And the glory of the
Lord shall be revealed, and all flesh shall
see (it) together, for the mouth of Jehovah
speaks.</p>

<p>6. A voice saying, Cry! And he said, What
shall I cry? All flesh is grass, and all its
favour like the flower of the field! 7.&nbsp;Dried
is the grass, faded is the flower; for the
breath of Jehovah has blown upon it. Surely
the people is grass. 8.&nbsp;Dried is the grass,
faded the flower, and the word of our God
shall stand for ever.</p>

<p>9. Upon a high mountain, get thee up,
bringer of good news, O Zion! Raise with
strength thy voice, bringer of good news,
Jerusalem! Raise (it), fear not; say to the
towns of Judah, Lo, your God! 10.&nbsp;Lo, the
Lord Jehovah is coming in (the person of) a
strong one, and His arm (is) ruling for Him.
Lo, His hire is with Him, and His wages
before Him. 11.&nbsp;Like a shepherd His flock
will He feed, with His arm will He gather the
lambs, and in His bosom carry (them): the
nursing (ewes) He will (gently) lead.</p>

<p>12. Who hath measured the waters in the
hollow of His hand, and meted out heaven
with the span, and comprehended in a measure
the dust of the earth, and weighed in a balance
the mountains, and the hills in scales?
13.&nbsp;Who hath measured the Spirit of Jehovah,
and (who, as) the man of His counsel, will
teach Him? 14.&nbsp;Whom did He consult, and
he made Him understand, and taught Him in
the path of judgment, and taught Him knowledge,
and the way of understanding (who)
will make Him know? 15.&nbsp;Lo, nations are
as a drop from a bucket, and as dust on scales
are reckoned; lo, islands as an atom He will
take up. 16.&nbsp;And Lebanon is not enough for
burning, and its beasts are not enough for a
sacrifice. 17.&nbsp;All the nations (are) as nothing
before Him, less than nothing and vanity are
counted to Him.</p>

<p>18. And (now) to whom will ye liken God,
and what likeness will ye compare to Him?
19.&nbsp;The image a carver has wrought, and a
gilder with gold shall overlay it, and chains of
silver (he is) casting. 20.&nbsp;(As for) the man
impoverished (by) offering, a tree (that) will
not rot he chooses, a wise carver he seeks for
it, to set up an image (that) shall not be
moved. 21.&nbsp;Will you not know? Will you
not hear? has it not been told you from the
first? have you not understood (from) the
foundations of the earth? 22.&nbsp;The (One)
sitting over the circle of the earth, and its
inhabitants (are) as locusts; the One spreading
like an awning the heavens, and He stretches
<span class="pagenum" id="pA46L">[p.&nbsp;A46L]</span>
them out like a tent to dwell in; 23.&nbsp;the One
bringing princes to nothing, the judges of the
earth like emptiness He has made. 24.&nbsp;Not
even planted were they, not even sown, not
even rooted in the ground their stock, and He
just breathed upon them, and they withered,
and a whirlwind like the chaff shall take
them up. 25.&nbsp;And now to (whom) will ye
liken Me, and to (whom) shall I be equal? saith
the Holy One.</p>

<p>26. Lift up on high your eyes and see&mdash;who
hath created these?&mdash;and who is the (One)
bringing out by number their host?&mdash;to all of
them by name will He call&mdash;from abundance
of might and because strong in power&mdash;not
one faileth. 27.&nbsp;Why sayest thou, O Jacob,
and why (thus) speak, O Israel? Hidden is
my way from Jehovah, and from my God my
cause will pass away. 28.&nbsp;Hast thou not
known? hast thou not heard? The God of
eternity, Jehovah, the Creator of the ends of
the earth, will not faint, and will not tire;
there is no search (with respect) to His understanding.
29.&nbsp;Giving to the weary strength,
and to the powerless might will He increase.
30.&nbsp;And (yet) weary shall youths be and faint,
and chosen (youths) shall be weakened, be
weakened. 31.&nbsp;And (on the other hand) those
waiting for Jehovah shall gain new strength;
they shall raise the pinion like the eagles, they
shall run and not be weary, they shall walk
and not faint.</p>

<p>XLI.&mdash;[Until the ends of Israel&rsquo;s national
existence are accomplished, that existence
must continue in spite of hostile nations and
their gods, who shall all perish sooner than
the chosen people, vers. 1&ndash;16. However,
feeble Israel may be in herself, Jehovah will
protect him, and raise up the necessary instruments
for his deliverance and triumph.]</p>

<p>1. Be silent to Me, O islands, and the
nations shall gain new strength; they shall
approach, then shall they speak, together to
the judgment-seat will we draw near. 2.&nbsp;Who
hath raised up from the east? Righteousness
shall call Him to its foot; it shall give nations
before Him, and cause Him to tread upon
kings; it shall give (them) as dust to His
sword, and as driven stubble to His bow.
3.&nbsp;He shall pursue them; He shall pass (in)
safety; a path with His feet He shall not go.
4.&nbsp;Who hath wrought and done it, calling the
generations from the beginning? I Jehovah,
the First and with the Last, I (am) He.</p>

<p>5. The isles have seen it and are afraid, the
ends of the earth tremble: they have approached
and come. 6.&nbsp;A man his neighbour
they will help, and to his brother (one) will
say, Be strong! 7.&nbsp;And the carver has
strengthened the gilder, the smoother with
the hammer, the smiter on the anvil; he says
<span class="pagenum" id="pA47L">[p.&nbsp;A47L]</span>
of the solder, It is good; and he sharpeneth
it with nails; it shall not be moved. 8.&nbsp;And
thou Israel My servant, Jacob whom I have
chosen, the seed of Abraham My friend;
9.&nbsp;thou whom I have grasped from the ends of
the earth, and from its sides have I called
thee, My servant (art) thou; I have chosen
thee, and not rejected thee.</p>

<p>10. Fear thou not, for I (am) with thee;
look not around, for I (am) thy God; I have
strengthened thee, yea, I have helped thee,
yea, I have upheld thee with the right hand
of My righteousness. 11.&nbsp;Lo, ashamed and
confounded shall be all those inflamed against
thee; they shall be as though they were not,
and destroyed shall be they that strive with
thee. 12.&nbsp;Thou shalt seek them and not find
them, the men of quarrel; they shall be as
nothing and as nought, thy men of war.
13.&nbsp;For I, Jehovah thy God, (am) holding fast thy
right hand; the (one) saying to thee, Fear
not, I have helped thee. 14.&nbsp;Fear not, thou
worm Jacob, and ye men of Israel; I have
helped thee, saith Jehovah, and thy Redeemer,
the Holy One of Israel. 15.&nbsp;Behold I have
placed thee for a threshing-sledge, sharp, new,
possessed of teeth; thou shalt thresh mountains
and beat (them) small, and hills like the
chaff shalt thou make. 16.&nbsp;Thou shalt fan
them, and a wind shall take them up, and a
whirlwind shall scatter them, and thou shalt
joy in Jehovah, and in the Holy One of Israel
shalt thou boast.</p>

<p>17. The suffering and the poor (are) seeking
water, and it is not; their tongue with thirst
is parched. I Jehovah will answer them.
18.&nbsp;I will open upon bare hills streams, and in the
midst of valleys fountains; I will convert the
desert into a pool of water, and the dry land
into springs of water. 19.&nbsp;I will give in the
wilderness cedar, acacia, and myrtle, and oil
tree; I will place in the desert fir, pine, and
box together. 20.&nbsp;That they may see, and
know, and consider, and understand together,
that the hand of Jehovah hath done this, and
the Holy One of Israel hath created it.</p>

<p>21. Present your cause, saith Jehovah;
bring forward your strong reasons, saith the
King of Jacob. 22.&nbsp;Let them bring forward
and show forth to us the (things) which are to
happen; the former things, when they were,
show forth, and we will set our heart, and
know the issue; or (else) the coming events
make us to hear. 23.&nbsp;Show forth the (things)
to come hereafter, and we will know that ye
are gods; yes, ye shall do good or evil, and we
will look about and see together. 24.&nbsp;Lo, ye
are of nothing, and your work of nought; an
abomination is he that chooseth you. 25.&nbsp;I
have raised up (one) from the north, and he
has come; from the rising of the sun shall he
call upon My name; and he shall come upon
<span class="pagenum" id="pA48L">[p.&nbsp;A48L]</span>
princes as upon mortar, and as a potter
treadeth clay. 26.&nbsp;Who hath declared from
the beginning? (Say) and we will know; and
beforehand, and we will say, True! Nay,
there was none that told; nay, there was none
that uttered; nay, there was none that heard
your words. 27.&nbsp;(I am the) first (to say) to
Zion, Behold, behold them! and (to give) to
Jerusalem a bringer of good news. 28.&nbsp;And
I will look, but there is no man; and of these,
but there is no one advising; and I will ask
them, and (perhaps) they will return an
answer. 29.&nbsp;Lo, they (are) all nought, nothing
their words, wind and emptiness their molten
images.</p>

<p>XLII.&mdash;[This chapter exhibits to our view
the servant of Jehovah, <i>i.e.,</i> the Messiah and
His people, as a complex person, and as the
messenger or representative of God among
the nations. His mode of operation is described,
vers. 1&ndash;4. The effects of His influence
are represented, as not natural but
spiritual, vers. 5&ndash;9. The power of God is
pledged for His success, notwithstanding all
appearances of inaction or indifference on His
part, vers 10&ndash;17. In the latter portion of
the chapter, the Church or Body of Christ, as
distinguished from its Head, and representing
Him until He came, is charged with unfaithfulness
to its great trust, and this unfaithfulness
declared to be the cause of what it
suffered, vers. 18&ndash;25.]</p>

<p>1. Behold My servant! I will hold Him
fast; My chosen One, (in whom) My soul
delights; I have put My Spirit upon Him;
judgment to the nations shall He cause to go
forth. 2.&nbsp;He shall not cry, and He shall not
raise (His voice), and He shall not let His
voice be heard in the street. 3.&nbsp;A broken
reed shall He not break, and a dim wick will
He not quench; by the truth He will bring
forth judgment. 4.&nbsp;He shall not be dim,
and He shall not be crushed, until He shall
set judgment in the earth, and for His law
the isles shall wait.</p>

<p>5. Thus saith the mighty (God), Jehovah,
creating the heavens and stretching them out,
spreading the earth and its issues, giving
breath to the people on it, and spirit to those
walking in it. 6.&nbsp;I, Jehovah, have called
Thee in righteousness, and will lay hold of
Thy hand, and will keep Thee, and will give
Thee for a covenant of the people, for a light
of the Gentiles. 7.&nbsp;to open blind eyes, to
bring out from prison the bondman, from the
house of confinement the dwellers in darkness.
8.&nbsp;I am Jehovah, that is My name, and My
glory to another will I not give, and My
praise to graven images. 9.&nbsp;The former
things&mdash;lo, they have come, and new things
I (am) telling; before they spring forth I
will let you hear (them).</p>

<p>10. Sing to Jehovah a new song, His praise
<span class="pagenum" id="pA49L">[p.&nbsp;A49L]</span>
from the end of the earth, (ye) going down to
the sea and its fulness, isles and their inhabitants!
11.&nbsp;The desert and its towns shall
raise (the voice), the enclosures (in which)
Kedar dwells; the dwellers in the rock shall
shout, from the top of the mountains shall
they cry aloud. 12.&nbsp;They shall give to
Jehovah honour, and His praise in the islands
they shall show forth. 13.&nbsp;Jehovah, like a
strong one, will go forth; like a warrior He
will cry; against His foes will show Himself
strong. 14.&nbsp;I have long been still, (saying) I
will hold my peace, I will restrain myself.
(But now), like the travailing (woman) I will
shriek, I will pant and gasp at once. 15.&nbsp;I
will lay waste mountains and hills, and all
their herbage will I dry up; I will turn
streams to islands, and pools will I dry up.
16.&nbsp;And I will make the blind walk in a way
they know not, in paths they know not I will
make them tread; I will turn darkness before
them to light, and obliquities to straightness.
These are the words; I have made them, and
have not left them. 17.&nbsp;They shall be turned
back, they shall be utterly ashamed, those
trusting in the graven image, those saying to
the molten images, Ye are our gods!</p>

<p>18. Ye deaf, hear! and, ye blind, look to
see! 19.&nbsp;Who (is) blind but My servant, and
deaf like My messenger (whom) I will send?
Who (is) blind like the devoted are, and blind
like the servant of Jehovah? 20.&nbsp;Thou hast
seen many things and wilt not observe.
(Sent) to open ears! and he will not hear!
21.&nbsp;Jehovah (is) willing for His righteousness&rsquo;
sake; He will magnify the law and make it
honourable.</p>

<p>22. And (yet) it (is) a people spoiled and
robbed, ensnared in holes all of them, and in
houses of confinement they are hidden. They
have become a spoil, and there is none delivering;
a prey, and there is none saying, Restore!
23.&nbsp;Who among you will give ear to this, and
hearken and hear for the time to come?
24.&nbsp;Who has given Jacob for a prey, and Israel to
spoilers? Hast not Jehovah, against whom
we have sinned? and they were not willing in
His ways to walk, and did not hearken to
His law. 25.&nbsp;And He poured upon him fury,
(even) His wrath and the violence of war:
and it set him on fire round about, and he
knew it not; and it burned him, and he will
not lay it to heart.</p>

<p>XLIII.&mdash;[Israel is the peculiar people of
Jehovah, cherished and favoured at the expense
of other nations, vers. 1&ndash;4. But these
are one day to become partakers of the same
advantages, vers. 5&ndash;9. The proofs of the
Divine protection are afforded by the history
of Israel, vers. 10&ndash;13. One of the most
remarkable, yet future, is the downfall of
Babylon and the liberation of the exiles, vers.
14, 15. An analogous example was the
<span class="pagenum" id="pA50L">[p.&nbsp;A50L]</span>
deliverance from Egypt, vers. 16, 17. But
both these instances shall be forgotten in
comparison with the great change which
awaits the Church hereafter, vers. 18&ndash;21.
Of all these distinguishing favours none was
owing to the merit of the people, but all to the
sovereign grace of God, vers. 22&ndash;25. The
people were not only destitute of merit, but
deserving of punishment, which they had
experienced and must experience again, vers.
26&ndash;28.]</p>

<p>1. And now, thus saith Jehovah, thy Creator,
O Jacob, and thy Former, O Israel, Fear not,
for I have redeemed thee, I have called by thy
name, thou art Mine. 2.&nbsp;When thou passest
through the waters, I will be with thee; and
through the rivers, they shall not overflow
thee; when thou walkest through the fire,
thou shalt not be scorched, and the flame
shall not burn thee. 3.&nbsp;For I, Jehovah, thy
God, the Holy One of Israel, thy Saviour,
have given (as) thy ransom Egypt, Ethiopia,
and Seba, instead of thee. 4.&nbsp;Since thou wast
precious in My eyes; thou hast been honoured,
and I have loved thee, and will give men instead
of thee, and nations instead of thy
life.</p>

<p>5. Fear not, for I (am) with thee; from
the east I will make thy seed come, and from
the west I will gather thee; 6.&nbsp;I will say to
the north, Give, and to the south, Withhold
not, let My sons come from far, and My
daughters from the ends of the earth;
7.&nbsp;Every one called by My name, and for My
glory I have created him; I have formed him
yea, I have made him. 8.&nbsp;He hath brought
out the blind people, and there are eyes (to
them), and the deaf, and (there are) ears to
them. 9.&nbsp;All the nations are gathered together,
and the people are to be assembled.
Who among them will declare this, and let
us hear the first things? Let them produce
their witnesses and be justified; and (if they
cannot do this) let them hear (My witnesses),
and say, (it is) the truth.</p>

<p>10. Ye are My witnesses saith Jehovah,
and My servant whom I have chosen, that ye
may know and believe Me, and may understand
that I am He; before Me was not
formed a god, and after Me there shall not
be; 11.&nbsp;I, I, Jehovah, and beside Me there
is no Saviour. 12.&nbsp;I have told and have
saved and have declared, and there is not
among you (any) stranger; and ye are My
witnesses, saith Jehovah, and I (am) God.
13.&nbsp;Even from the day I am He, and there
is no one freeing from My hand; I will do,
and who will undo it?</p>

<p>14. Thus saith Jehovah, your Redeemer, the
Holy One of Israel: For your sake I have
sent to Babylon, and have brought down
<span class="pagenum" id="pA51L">[p.&nbsp;A51L]</span>
fugitives all of them; and the Chaldeans, in
the ships their shout; 15.&nbsp;I, Jehovah, your
Holy One, the Creator of Israel, your King.</p>

<p>16. Thus saith Jehovah, the (One) giving
in the sea a way, and in mighty waters a
path; 17.&nbsp;the (One) bringing out chariot
and horse, force and strong; together shall
they lie, they shall not rise; they are extinct,
like tow they are quenched.</p>

<p>18. Remember not former things, and old
things consider not. 19.&nbsp;Behold I (am) doing
(something) new, it is yet to sprout; do you
not know it? Yes, I will place in the wilderness
a way, in the desert streams. 20.&nbsp;The
living creature of the field shall honour Me,
jackass and ostriches; because I have given in
the wilderness waters, and streams in the
desert, to give drink to My people, My chosen.
21.&nbsp;This people I have formed for Myself;
My praise shall they recount.</p>

<p>22. And not Me hast thou called, O Jacob;
for thou hast been weary of Me, O Israel.
23.&nbsp;Thou hast not brought to Me the sheep
of thy burnt-offering, and (with) thy sacrifices
thou hast not honoured Me. I have not
made thee serve with oblations, and I have
not wearied thee with incense. 24.&nbsp;Thou
hast not brought for Me sweet cane with
honey, and with the fat of thy sacrifices thou
hast not drenched Me; thou hast only made
Me serve with thy sins, and wearied Me with
thine iniquities. 25.&nbsp;I, I am He blotting out
thy transgressions for Mine own sake, and
thy sins I will not remember.</p>

<p>26. Remind Me; let us plead together:
state (thy case) that thou mayest be justified.
27.&nbsp;Thy first father sinned, and thy interpreters
rebelled against Me. 28.&nbsp;And I will
profane the holy chiefs, and will give up Jacob
to the curse, and Israel to reproaches.</p>

<p>XLIV.&mdash;[The chapter opens, like the fortieth
and forty-third, with cheering promises to
Israel, followed by reasons for confiding in
them, drawn from the wisdom, power, and
goodness of Jehovah. The specific promise,
which constitutes the theme or basis of the
prophecy, is that of abundant spiritual influences
and their fruits; not only internal
prosperity, but large accessions from without,
vers. 1&ndash;5. The pledge for the fulfilment of
this promise is afforded by the proofs of God&rsquo;s
omniscience, as contrasted with all other gods,
vers. 6&ndash;9. The folly of image-worship is
then established by two arguments. The first
is, that idols are themselves the creatures
of mere men, vers. 10&ndash;14. The other is, that
they are not only made, and made by man,
but made of the very same materials applied
to the most trivial domestic uses, vers. 15&ndash;20.
<span class="pagenum" id="pA52L">[p.&nbsp;A52L]</span>
From this demonstration of the power of
Jehovah to perform His promise we are now
brought back to the promise itself, vers. 21&ndash;24.
This is again confirmed by an appeal to
God&rsquo;s creative power, and illustrated by the
raising up of Cyrus as a deliverer to Israel,
vers. 25&ndash;28.]</p>

<p>1. And now hear, Jacob My servant, and
Israel whom I have chosen. 2.&nbsp;Thus saith
Jehovah, Thy Maker and thy Former from the
womb will help thee; fear not, My servant
Jacob, and Jeshurun whom I have chosen.
3.&nbsp;For I will pour waters upon the thirsty, and
flowing (waters) on the dry (land); I will pour
My Spirit on thy seed, and My blessing on
thine offspring. 4.&nbsp;And they shall spring up
in the midst of the grass, like willows by the
water-courses. 5.&nbsp;They shall say, To Jehovah
I (belong); and this shall call on the name of
Jacob; and this shall inscribe with his hand,
To Jehovah, and with the name of Israel shall
entitle.</p>

<p>6. Thus saith Jehovah, King of Israel, and
his Redeemer Jehovah of hosts; I (am) first,
and I (am) last, and without Me there is no
God. 7.&nbsp;And who, like Me, will call, and tell
it, and state it to Me, since I placed the
ancient people; and coming things and things
which are to come will tell to them? 8.&nbsp;Quake
not and fear not; have I not let thee hear and
told thee, and are ye not My witnesses? Is
there a God without Me? I know not (any).
9.&nbsp;The image-carvers all of them are vanity,
and their desired ones are worthless; and their
witnesses themselves will not see and will not
know, that they may be ashamed.</p>

<p>10. Who formed the god and cast the image
to no use? 11.&nbsp;Lo, all his fellows shall be
ashamed, and the workmen themselves are of
men; they shall assemble all of them, they
shall stand, they shall tremble, they shall
be ashamed together. 12.&nbsp;He has carved (iron)
with a graver, and has wrought (it) in the
coals, and with his hammer he will shape it.
Besides, he is hungry and has no strength, he
has not drunk water and is faint. 13.&nbsp;He has
carved wood, he has stretched a line, he will
mark it with the awl, he will form it with the
chisel, and with the compass he will mark it,
and then he will make it after the model of a
man, like the beauty of mankind, to dwell in
<span class="pagenum" id="pA53L">[p.&nbsp;A53L]</span>
a house. 14.&nbsp;To hew him down cedars, and
(now) he has taken a cypress and an oak&mdash;and
has raised it for himself among the trees
of the forest&mdash;he has planted a pine, and the
rain shall increase (it). 15.&nbsp;And it shall be
to man for fuel, and he has taken of them and
warmed himself; yea, he will kindle and bake
bread; yea, he will form a god and fall
prostrate; he has made it a graven image
and bowed down to them. 16.&nbsp;Half of it he
hath burned in the fire; on half of it he will
eat flesh, he will roast and be filled; yea, he
will warm himself and say, Aha, I am warm,
I have seen fire. 17.&nbsp;And the rest of it he has
made into a god, into his graven image; he
will bow down to it, and will worship, and will
pray to it, and say, Deliver me, for thou (art)
my god. 18.&nbsp;They have not known, and they
will not understand, for He hath smeared
their eyes from seeing, their hearts from
doing wisely. 19.&nbsp;And he will not bring it
home to himself, and there (is) not knowledge,
and (there is) not understanding to say,
Half of it I have burned in the fire, and have
also baked bread on its coals; I will roast flesh
and eat, and the rest of it I will make to (be)
an abomination; to a log of wood I will cast
myself down. 20.&nbsp;Feeding on ashes, (his)
heart is deceived; it has led him astray, and
he cannot deliver himself; and he will not say,
Is there not a lie in my right hand?</p>

<p>21. Remember these (things), Jacob and
Israel, for thou art My servant; I have formed
thee, a servant unto Me art thou; Israel, thou
shalt not be forgotten by Me. 22.&nbsp;I have
blotted out, like a cloud, thy transgressions,
and like a vapour, thy sins; return to Me, for
I have redeemed thee. 23.&nbsp;Sing, O heavens,
for Jehovah hath done (it); shout, ye lower
parts of the earth; break forth, ye mountains,
Jehovah hath redeemed Jacob, and in Israel
He will glorify Himself. 24.&nbsp;Thus saith
Jehovah, thy Redeemer, and thy Former from
the womb, I, Jehovah, making all, stretching
the heavens alone, spreading the earth by
Myself.</p>

<p>25. Breaking the signs of babblers, and
diviners He will madden; turning sages back,
and their knowledge He will stultify;
26.&nbsp;confirming the word of His servant, and the
counsel of His messengers He will fulfil; the
(One) saying as to Jerusalem, She shall be
inhabited, and as the cities of Judah, They
<span class="pagenum" id="pA54L">[p.&nbsp;A54L]</span>
shall be built, and the ruins will I raise;
27.&nbsp;the (One) saying to the deep, Be dry, and I
will dry up thy floods; 28.&nbsp;the (One) saying
as to Cyrus, My shepherd, and all My pleasure
he will fulfil, and saying to Jerusalem, Thou
shalt be built, and (to) the temple, Thou shalt
be founded.</p>

<p>XLV.&mdash;[The chapter opens, in direct continuation
of the forty-fourth, with a further
prophecy of Cyrus and of his successors, vers.
1&ndash;3. These are then referred to the power of
God and His design of mercy towards His
people, so that all misgivings or distrust must
be irrational and impious, vers. 4&ndash;13. Then
leaving Cyrus out of view, the prophet turns
his eyes to the nations, and declares that they
must be subdued, but only in order to be
blessed and saved, which is declared to have
been the Divine purpose, and revealed as such
from the beginning, vers 14&ndash;25.]</p>

<p>1. Thus saith Jehovah to His anointed, to
Cyrus, whose right hand I have held fast, to
tread down before him nations, and the loins
of kings I will loose; to open before him
double doors, and gates shall not be shut.
2.&nbsp;I will go before thee, and uneven places will
I level; doors of brass I will break, and bars
of iron I will cut. 3.&nbsp;And I will give thee
treasures of darkness and hidden riches of
secret places, in order that thou mayest know
that I Jehovah, the (One) calling thee by
name, am the God of Israel.</p>

<p>4. For the sake of My servant Jacob and
Israel My chosen, therefore will I call thee by
thy name: I will give thee a title, and thou
hast not known Me. 5.&nbsp;I am Jehovah, and
there is no other; except Me there is no God;
I will gird thee, and thou hast not known Me;
6.&nbsp;that they may know, from the rising of the
sun to the west, that there is none without
Me; I am Jehovah, and there is no other.
7.&nbsp;Forming light and creating darkness, making
peace and creating evil, I (am) Jehovah
doing all these things. 8.&nbsp;Distil, ye heavens,
from above, and let the clouds pour out
righteousness; let the earth open, and let
salvation and righteousness grow, let him
bring (them) forth together. I Jehovah have
created it. 9.&nbsp;Woe to him striving with his
Maker&mdash;a potsherd with potsherds of the
earth. Shall clay say to its former, What
art thou doing? and thy work, He has no
hands? 10.&nbsp;Woe to him saying to a father,
What wilt thou beget? and to a mother,
What wilt thou bring forth? 11.&nbsp;Thus saith
Jehovah, the Holy One of Israel and his
Maker, Ask Me (of) the things to come; concerning
My sins and concerning the work of
My hands, ye may command Me. 12.&nbsp;I make
the earth, and man upon it I created; I, My
hands, spread the heavens, and all their host
commanded. 13.&nbsp;I, and no other, raised him
up in righteousness, and all his ways will I
make straight; (it is) he (that) shall build My
city, and My captivity he will send (home),
<span class="pagenum" id="pA55L">[p.&nbsp;A55L]</span>
not for reward, and not for hire, saith Jehovah
of hosts.</p>

<p>14. Thus saith Jehovah, The toil of Egypt,
and the gain of Cush, and the Sebaim men of
measure unto thee shall pass, and to thee shall
they belong, after thee shall they go, in chains
shall they pass over; and unto thee shall they
bow themselves, to thee shall they pray, saying,
Only in thee (is) God, and there is none
besides, no (other) God. 15.&nbsp;Verily Thou art
a God hiding Thyself, O God of Israel, the
Saviour! 16.&nbsp;They are ashamed and also
confounded all of them together, they are
gone away in confusion&mdash;the carvers of images.
17.&nbsp;Israel is saved in Jehovah (with) an everlasting
salvation; ye shall not be ashamed,
and ye shall not be confounded for ever.
18.&nbsp;For thus saith Jehovah, the Creator of the
heavens&mdash;He is God&mdash;the Former of the earth
and its Maker&mdash;He established it&mdash;not to be
empty did He create it&mdash;to be inhabited He
formed it&mdash;I am Jehovah, and there is none
besides. 19.&nbsp;Not in secret have I spoken, in
a dark place of the earth; I have not said
to the seed of Jacob, In vain seek ye Me. I
(am) Jehovah, speaking truth, declaring right
things. 20.&nbsp;Gather yourselves and come;
draw near together, ye escaped of the nations.
They know not, those carrying the wood, their
graven image, and praying to a god (who)
cannot save. 21.&nbsp;Bring forward and bring
near! Yea, let them consult together. Who
hath caused this to be heard of old, since thou
declared it! Have not I Jehovah? and there
is no other God besides Me; a righteous and
a saving God, there is none besides Me.
22.&nbsp;Turn unto Me and be ye saved, all ye ends of
the earth, for I am God, and there is none
besides. 23.&nbsp;By Myself I have sworn; the
word is gone out of a mouth of righteousness,
and shall not return, that unto Me shall bow
every knee, shall swear every tongue.
24.&nbsp;Only in Jehovah have I, says he, righteousness
and strength; unto Him shall he come,
and all that were incensed at Him shall be
ashamed. 25.&nbsp;In Jehovah shall be justified
and boast themselves all the seed of Israel.</p>

<p>XLVI.&mdash;[In conformation of the general
threats and promises with which chap. xlv. is
wound up, the prophet now exhibits the particular
case of the Babylonian idols, as a single
instance chosen from the whole range of past
and future history. They are described as
fallen and gone away into captivity, wholly
unable to protect their worshippers or save
themselves, vers. 1, 2. With these he then
contrasts Jehovah&rsquo;s constant care of Israel in
times past and in time to come, vers. 3, 4. The
contrast is carried out by another description
of the origin and impotence of idols, vers.
5&ndash;7, and another assertion of Jehovah&rsquo;s sole
Divinity, as proved by His knowledge and control
<span class="pagenum" id="pA56L">[p.&nbsp;A56L]</span>
of the future, and by the raising up of
Cyrus in particular, vers. 8&ndash;11. This brings
him back to the same solemn warning of approaching
judgments, and the same alternative
of life and death, with which the foregoing
chapter closes, vers. 12, 13.]</p>

<p>1. Bel is bowed down, Nebo stooping; their
images are (consigned) to the beasts and to
the cattle. Your burdens are packed up (as)
a load to the weary (beast). 2.&nbsp;They stoop,
they bow together; they cannot save the load;
themselves are gone into captivity.</p>

<p>3. Hearken unto Me, O house of Jacob, and
all the remnant of the house of Israel, those
borne from the belly, those carried from the
womb. 4.&nbsp;And to old age I am He, and to
grey hair I will bear (you); I have done it,
and I will carry and I will bear and save
(you).</p>

<p>5. To whom will ye liken Me, and equal and
compare Me, that we may be like? 6.&nbsp;The
prodigals will weigh gold from the bag, and
silver with the rod; they will hire a gilder,
and he will make it a god: they will bow
down, yea, they will fall prostrate. 7.&nbsp;They
will lift him on the shoulder, they will carry
him, they will set him in his place, and he
will stand (there); from his place he will not
move; yea, one will cry to him, and he will
not answer, from his distress he will not save
him.</p>

<p>8. Remember this, and show yourselves men;
bring it home, ye apostates, (to) your mind.
9.&nbsp;Remember former things of old, for I am
the Mighty, and there is no other God, and
there is none like Me, 10.&nbsp;declaring from the
first the last, and from ancient time the
things which are not (yet) done, saying, My
counsel shall stand and all My pleasure I will
do. 11.&nbsp;Calling from the east a bird of prey,
from a land of distance the man of His counsel;
I have both said and will also bring it to
pass, I have formed (the plan) and will also
do it.</p>

<p>12. Hearken to Me, ye stout of heart, those
far from righteousness. 13.&nbsp;I have brought
near My righteousness, it shall not be far off;
and My salvation, it shall not tarry; and I
will place in Zion My salvation, to Israel My
glory.</p>

<p>XLVII.&mdash;[Having exemplified his general doctrine,
as to God&rsquo;s ability and purpose to do
justice both to friends and foes, by exhibiting
the downfall of the Babylonian idols, Isaiah
now attains the same end by predicting the
downfall of Babylon itself, and of the state to
which it gave its name. Under the figure of
a royal virgin, she is threatened with extreme
degradation and exposure, vers 1&ndash;3. Connecting
this event with Israel and Israel&rsquo;s
<span class="pagenum" id="pA57L">[p.&nbsp;A57L]</span>
God, as the great themes which it was intended
to illustrate, he predicts the fall of the empire
more distinctly, ver. 5, and assigns as a
reason the oppression of God&rsquo;s people, ver. 6,
pride and self-confidence, ver. 7&ndash;9, especially
reliance upon human wisdom and upon superstitious
arts, all which would prove entirely
insufficient to prevent the great catastrophe,
vers. 10&ndash;15.]</p>

<p>1. Come down! Sit on the dust, virgin
daughter of Babel! There is no throne,
daughter of Chasdim! For thou shalt not
continue to be called tender and delicate.
2.&nbsp;Take millstones and grind meal! Remove
thy veil, lift up thy skirt, uncover the leg,
cross streams! 3.&nbsp;Let thy nakedness be uncovered,
likewise let thy shame be seen. I
will take vengeance; I shall encounter no
man.</p>

<p>4. Our Redeemer, Jehovah of hosts (is) His
name, the Holy One of Israel.</p>

<p>5. Sit in silence and go into darkness,
daughter of Chasdim! For thou shalt not
continue to be called mistress of kingdoms. 6.&nbsp;I
was wroth against My people; I profaned My
heritage; and I gave them into thy hand.
Thou didst not show them mercy; on the
ancient thou didst aggravate thy yoke exceedingly;
7.&nbsp;and thou saidst, For ever I shall be
a mistress (of kingdoms); until (at last) thou
didst not lay these things to heart, thou didst
not remember the end of it. 8.&nbsp;And now,
hear this, thou voluptuous one, the (one) sitting
in security, the (one) saying in her heart,
I (am) and none besides; I shall not sit (as) a
widow, and I shall not know the loss of children;
9.&nbsp;and they shall come to thee,&mdash;these
two suddenly, loss of children and widowhood
in the midst of the multitude of thy enchantments,
in the midst of the multitude of thy
spells. 10.&nbsp;And (yet) thou art secure in thy
wickedness; thou hast said, there is no one
seeing me. Thy wisdom and thy knowledge,
it has seduced thee; and thou hast said in thy
heart, I am, and there is no other. 11.&nbsp;And so
there cometh upon thee evil,&mdash;thou shalt not
know how to charm it away; and there shall
fall upon thee ruin,&mdash;thou shalt not be able to
avert it; and there shall come upon thee suddenly
a crash,&mdash;thou shalt not know (it).
12.&nbsp;Persist now in thy spells and in the abundance
of thy charms, in which thou hast wearied
thyself; perhaps thou wilt be able to succeed,
perhaps thou wilt grow strong. 13.&nbsp;Thou art
wearied in the multitude of thy counsel. Now
let them stand and save thee, the dividers of
the heavens, the star-gazers, making known at
<span class="pagenum" id="pA58L">[p.&nbsp;A58L]</span>
the new-moon what shall come upon thee.
14.&nbsp;Behold, they are like stubble, fire has
burned them; they cannot deliver themselves
from the hand of the flame; (this fire) is not
a coal (at which) to warm one&rsquo;s self; a fire to
sit before. 15.&nbsp;Thus are they to thee; and so
are (even) thy traders: each to his own quarter,
straight before him, they wander; there
is no one saving thee.</p>

<p>XLVIII.&mdash;[Although Israel is God&rsquo;s chosen
and peculiar people, he is in himself unworthy
of the honour and unfaithful to the
trust, vers. 1, 2. Former predictions had been
uttered expressly to prevent his ascribing the
event to other gods, vers. 3&ndash;5. For the same
reason new predictions will be uttered now, of
events which have never been distinctly foretold,
vers. 6&ndash;8. God&rsquo;s continued favour to
His people has no reference to merit upon
their part, but is the fruit of His own sovereign
mercy, and intended to promote His
own designs, vers. 9&ndash;11. He again asserts
His own exclusive deity, as proved by the
creation of the world, by the prediction of
events still future, and especially by the raising
up of Cyrus, as a promised instrument to
execute His purpose, vers 12&ndash;16. The sufferings
of Israel are a fruit of his own sin, but
his prosperity and glory, of God&rsquo;s sovereign
grace, vers. 17&ndash;19. The book closes as it
opened, with a promise of deliverance from
exile, accompanied in this case by a solemn
limitation of the promise to its proper objects,
vers. 20&ndash;22.]</p>

<p>1. Here this, O house of Jacob, the man
called by the name of Israel, and from the
waters of Judah they have come out; those
swearing by the name of Jehovah, and (who)
of the God of Israel makes mention, not in
truth and not in righteousness. 2.&nbsp;Nor from
the Holy City they are called, and upon the
God of Israel rely; Jehovah of hosts is His
name.</p>

<p>3. The former things since then I declared,
and out of My mouth they went forth,
and I cause them to be heard; suddenly do I do
(them), and they come to pass. 4.&nbsp;Because I
know that thou art hard, and an iron sinew
(is) thy neck, and thy forehead brass, 5.&nbsp;therefore
I told thee long ago; before it comes I
have let thee hear (it), lest thou say, My idol
did them, my graven image and my molten
image ordered them.</p>

<p>6. Thou has heard the (prediction), see all
of it accomplished. And ye, will ye not predict
(something)? I have made thee to hear
new things from now, and (things) kept (in
reserve), which thou hast not known. 7.&nbsp;Now
they are created, and not of old; before this
<span class="pagenum" id="pA59L">[p.&nbsp;A59L]</span>
day thou hast never heard them, lest thou
shouldst say, Behold, I knew them. 8.&nbsp;Nay,
thou didst not hear; nay, thou didst not
know; likewise of old thine ear was not
opened; I knew thou wouldst act very treacherously,
and Apostate from the womb wast thou
called.</p>

<p>9. For My name&rsquo;s sake I will defer My
anger, and (for) My praise I will restrain (it)
towards thee, so as not to cut thee off. 10.&nbsp;Behold,
I have melted thee, and not with silver;
I have chosen thee in the furnace of affliction.
11.&nbsp;For My own sake, for My own sake, I will
do (it)&mdash;for how is it profaned!&mdash;and My
honour to another will I not give.</p>

<p>12. Hearken unto Me, O Jacob, and Israel
My called; I am He, I am the First, also I
the Last. 13.&nbsp;Also My hand founded the
earth, and My right hand spread the heavens;
I call to them, and they will stand up together.
14.&nbsp;Assemble yourselves, all of you, and hear!
Who among them hath predicted these things?
Jehovah loves him; He will do His pleasure
in Babylon, and His arm (shall be upon) the
Chaldees. 15.&nbsp;I, I have spoken; I have also
called him; I have brought him (forth), and
he prospers in his way. 16.&nbsp;Draw near unto
me! Hear this; not from the beginning in
secret have I spoken; from the time of its
being, I was there; and now the Lord Jehovah
hath sent me, and His Spirit.</p>

<p>17. Thus saith Jehovah, thy Redeemer, the
Holy One of Israel, I am Jehovah thy God,
teaching thee to profit, making thee to tread
in the way thou shalt go. 18.&nbsp;Oh that thou
hadst hearkened to My commandments! then
had thy peace been as a river, and thy righteousness
as the waves of the sea; 19.&nbsp;then
should have been like the sand thy seed, and
the offspring of thy bowels like (the offspring
of) its bowels; his name should not be cut off
from before Me.</p>

<p>20. Go forth from Babel! Flee ye from the
Chaldeans! With the voice of joy tell this,
cause it to be heard, utter it even to the end of
the earth; say ye, Jehovah hath redeemed
His servant Jacob. 21.&nbsp;And they thirsted not
in the desert (through which) He made them
go; water from a rock He made to flow for
them; and He clave the rock, and waters
gushed out. 22.&nbsp;There is no peace, saith Jehovah,
to the wicked.</p>

<p>XLIX.&mdash;[This chapter, like the whole division
which it introduces, has for its great
theme the relation of the Church to the
world, and of Israel to the Gentiles. It opens
with an exhibition of the Messiah and His
people, under one ideal person, as the great
appointed Teacher, Apostle, and Restorer of
the apostate nations, vers. 1&ndash;9. This is
<span class="pagenum" id="pA60L">[p.&nbsp;A60L]</span>
followed by a promise of Divine protection
and of glorious enlargement, attended by a
joyous revelation in the state of the whole
world, vers. 10&ndash;16. The doubts and apprehensions
of the Church herself are twice
recited under different forms, vers. 14, 24, and
as often met and silenced, first by repeated and
still stronger promises of God&rsquo;s unchanging
love to His people and of their glorious enlargement
and success, vers. 15&ndash;23; then
by an awful threatening of destruction to
their enemies and His, vers 25, 26.]</p>

<p>1. Hearken, ye Islands, unto Me, and attend,
ye nations from afar. Jehovah from the
womb hath called Me, from the bowels of My
mother He hath mentioned My name.
2.&nbsp;And He hath rendered My mouth like a
sharp sword, and He rendered Me as a polished
arrow, in His quiver He has hid Me. 3.&nbsp;And
He said to Me, Thou art My servant, Israel, in
whom I will be glorified. 4.&nbsp;And I said, In
vain have I toiled, for emptiness and vanity
My strength have I consumed; but My right
is with Jehovah and My work with My God.
5.&nbsp;And now, saith Jehovah, who formed Me
from the womb for a servant to Himself, to
restore Jacob to Him, and (yet) Israel will
not be gathered&mdash;and yet I shall be honoured
in the eyes of Jehovah, and My God has
(already) been My strength. 6.&nbsp;And He said,
It is a light thing that Thou shouldst be My
servant to raise up the tribes of Jacob, and
the preserved of Israel to restore; and I have
given Thee for a light to the Gentiles, to be
My salvation even to the end of the earth.
7.&nbsp;Thus saith Jehovah, the Redeemer of Israel,
His Holy One, to the heartily despised, to
the nation exciting abhorrence, to a servant of
rulers, Kings shall see it, and rise up, princes
(shall see) and bow themselves, for the sake of
Jehovah who is faithful, the Holy One of
Israel who has chosen Thee. 8.&nbsp;Thus saith
Jehovah, In a time of favour I have heard
Thee, and to a day of salvation have I helped
Thee; and I will keep Thee, and I will give
Thee for a covenant to the people, to raise
up the earth, and to cause to inherit the
desolate heritages; 9.&nbsp;to say to those bound,
Come forth, and to (those) who are in darkness,
Show yourselves.</p>

<p>On the ways they shall feed, and in all bare
hills shall be their pasture. 10.&nbsp;They shall
not hunger and they shall not thirst, and
there shall not smite them mirage and sun;
for He that hath mercy on them shall guide
them, and by springs of water shall He lead
them. 11.&nbsp;And I will place all mountains for
<span class="pagenum" id="pA61L">[p.&nbsp;A61L]</span>
the way, and My roads shall be high.
12.&nbsp;Behold, these from afar shall come, and
behold these from the north and from the
sea, and these from the land of Sinim.
13.&nbsp;Shout, O heavens, and rejoice, O earth, let
the mountains burst forth into a shout;
because Jehovah has comforted His people,
and on His sufferers He will have mercy.</p>

<p>14. And (yet) Zion said, Jehovah hath forsaken
me, and the Lord hath forgotten me.
15.&nbsp;Will a woman forget her suckling, so as
not to have mercy on the son of her womb?
Even these will forget, and (yet) I will not
forget thee. 16.&nbsp;Behold, on My palms have
I graven thee; thy walls (are) before Me
continually. 17.&nbsp;Thy sons hasten (to thee);
thy destroyers and thy wasters shall go out
from thee. 18.&nbsp;Lift up thine eyes round about
and see; all of them are gathered together,
they are come to thee. (As) I live, saith
Jehovah, (I swear) that all of them as an
ornament thou shalt put on, and bind them
like the bride. 19.&nbsp;For thy ruins, and thy
wastes, and thy land of desolation, for now
shalt thou be too narrow for the inhabitant,
and far off shall be thy devourers. 20.&nbsp;Again
shall they say in thine ears, The sons of thy
childlessness. (Too) narrow for me is the
place; come near for me, that I may dwell.
21.&nbsp;And thou shalt say in thine heart, Who
hath produced these for me? and I was
bereaved and barren, an exile and a banished
one? And these who brought up? Behold,
I was left alone; these where were they?
22.&nbsp;Thus saith the Lord Jehovah, Behold I
will lift up to the nations My hand, and I will
set up to the peoples My standard; and they
will bring thy sons in the bosom, and thy
daughters on the shoulders shall be carried.
23.&nbsp;And kings shall be thy nursing-fathers,
and their queens thy nursing-mothers; face
to the ground shall they bow to thee, and the
dust of thy feet shall they lick; and thou
shalt know that I am Jehovah, whose waiters
shall not be ashamed.</p>

<p>24. Shall the prey be taken from the
mighty, and shall the captivity of the righteous
be delivered? 25.&nbsp;For thus saith Jehovah,
Even the captives of the mighty shall
be taken, and the prey of the terrible shall
be delivered, and with thy strivers will I
strive, and thy sons will I save. 26.&nbsp;And I
will make thy oppressors eat their (own) flesh,
and as with new wine with their blood shall
they be drunken; and all flesh shall know
that I am Jehovah thy Saviour, and (that)
thy Redeemer is the Mighty One of Jacob.</p>

<p>L.&mdash;[This chapter contains no entirely new
element, but a fresh view of several which
<span class="pagenum" id="pA62L">[p.&nbsp;A62L]</span>
have already been repeatedly exhibited. The
first of these is the great truth, that the sufferings
of God&rsquo;s people are the necessary fruit of
their own sins, ver. 1. The second is the
power of Jehovah to accomplish their deliverance,
vers. 2, 3. The third is the Servant of
Jehovah, His mission, His qualifications for
it, His endurance of reproach, and opposition
on account of it, vers. 4&ndash;9. The fourth is
the way of salvation and the certain doom of
those who neglect it, vers. 10, 11.]</p>

<p>1. Thus saith Jehovah, Where is the bill of
divorcement of your mother, whom I have
sent away? Or which of My creditors (is it)
to whom I have sold you? Behold, for your
iniquities ye have been sold, and for your
transgressions has your mother been sent
away.</p>

<p>2. Why did I come, and there was no man?
(why) did I call, and there was no one answering?
Is My hand shortened, shortened, from
redemption? and is there with Me no power
to deliver? Behold, by My rebuke I will dry
up the sea, I will make streams a wilderness;
let their fish stink for want of water and die
of thirst. 3.&nbsp;I will clothe the heavens in
blackness, and sackcloth will I make their
covering.</p>

<p>4. The Lord God hath given to Me a ready
tongue, that I might know how to help the
weary (with) a word. He will waken, every
morning He will waken for Me the ear, that I
may hear like the disciples. 5.&nbsp;The Lord
Jehovah opened for Me the ear, and I resisted
not, I did not draw back. 6.&nbsp;My back I gave
to those smiting, and My cheeks to those
plucking (the hair); My face I did not hide
from shame and spitting. 7.&nbsp;And the Lord
God will help Me, therefore I am not confounded;
therefore I have set My face as a
flint, and I know that I shall not be ashamed.
8.&nbsp;Near is My justifier; who will contend
with Me? We will stand together. Who is
My adversary? Let him draw near to Me.
9.&nbsp;Behold, the Lord Jehovah will help Me;
who (is) he (that) will condemn Me? All they
like the garment shall grow old; the moth
shall devour them.</p>

<p>10. Who among you is a fearer of Jehovah,
hearkening to the voice of His servant, who
walketh in darkness, and there is no light to
him? Let him trust in the name of Jehovah,
and lean upon his God. 11.&nbsp;Lo, all of you
kindling fire, girding sparks (or, fiery darts), go
in the light of your fire, and in the sparks ye
have kindled. From My hand is this to you;
in pain shall ye lie down.</p>

<p>LI.&mdash;[This chapter is a direct continuation
of the preceding declarations with respect to
the vocation of the Church, and the Divine
administration towards her. The possibility
of her increase, as previously promised, is
<span class="pagenum" id="pA63L">[p.&nbsp;A63L]</span>
evinced by the example of Abraham, from
whom all Israel descended, vers. 1&ndash;3. In
like manner many shall be added from the
Gentiles, vers. 4&ndash;6. Their enemies shall not
only fail to destroy them, but shall be themselves
destroyed, vers. 7, 8. This is confirmed
by another historical example, that of
Egypt, vers. 9, 10. The same assurances are
then repeated, with a clearer promise of the
new dispensation, vers. 11&ndash;16. The chapter
closes with a direct address to Zion, who,
though helpless in herself and destitute of
human aid, is sure of God&rsquo;s protection and of
the destruction of her enemies and His, vers.
17&ndash;23.]</p>

<p>1. Hearken unto Me, ye who are following
after righteousness, ye who are seeking Jehovah;
look unto the rock (from which) ye have
been hewn, and the hole of the pit from which
ye have been digged. 2.&nbsp;Look unto Abraham
your father and unto Sarah (that) bare you:
for I have called him one, and I will bless him
and increase him (still). 3.&nbsp;For Jehovah
hath comforted Zion; He hath comforted all
our wastes, and hath made her wilderness like
Eden, and her desert like the garden of the
Lord; joy and gladness shall be found in her,
thanksgiving and the voice of melody.
4.&nbsp;Attend unto Me, My people: and My nation,
unto Me give ear: that law from Me shall go
forth, and My judgment for a light of the
nations. 5.&nbsp;Near (is) My righteousness, gone
forth is My salvation, and My arm shall judge
the nations. For Me shall the islands wait,
and in My arm they shall hope. 6.&nbsp;Raise to
the heavens your eyes, and look unto the
earth beneath; and the earth like the garment
(which grows old) shall grow old, and its inhabitants
likewise shall die; and My salvation
to eternity shall be, and My righteousness
shall not be broken.</p>

<p>7. Hearken unto Me, ye that know righteousness,
people (with) My law in their heart:
hear not the reproach of men, and by their
scoffs be not broken (in spirit). 8.&nbsp;For like
the (moth-eaten) garment shall the moth
devour them, and like the (worm-eaten) wool
shall the worm devour them; and My righteousness
to eternity shall be, and My salvation
to an age of ages.</p>

<p>9. Awake, awake, put on strength, arm of
Jehovah; awake, as (in the) days of old, the
ages of eternities; art Thou not the same that
hewed Rahab in pieces, that wounded the
dragon? 10.&nbsp;Art not Thou the same that
dried the sea, the waters of the great deep,
that placed the depths of the sea (as) a way
for the passage of redeemed ones?</p>

<p>11. And the ransomed of Jehovah shall
return and come to Zion with shouting, and
everlasting joy upon their head; gladness and
joy shall overtake (them), sorrow and sighing
have fled away. 12.&nbsp;I, I am He that comforteth
<span class="pagenum" id="pA64L">[p.&nbsp;A64L]</span>
you; who art thou that thou shouldst
be afraid of man (who) is to die, and of the
son of man who (as) grass is to be given?
13.&nbsp;And hast forgotten Jehovah thy Maker,
spreading the heavens and founding the earth,
and hast trembled continually all the day,
from before the wrath of the oppressor as he
made ready to destroy? And where is (now)
the wrath of the oppressor? 14.&nbsp;He hastens
bowing to be loosed, and he shall not die in the
pit, and his bread shall not fail. 15.&nbsp;And I
am Jehovah thy God, rousing the sea, and
then its waves roar; Jehovah of hosts (is) His
name. 16.&nbsp;And I have put My words in thy
mouth, and in the shadow of My hand I have
the earth, and to say to Zion, Thou art My
people. 17.&nbsp;Rouse thyself! rouse thyself!
Arise, Jerusalem! (thou) who hast drunk at
the hand of Jehovah the cup of His wrath;
the bowl of the cup of reeling thou hast
drunk, thou hast wrung out.</p>

<p>18. There is no guide to hear of all the sons
she has brought forth, and no one grasping
her hand of all the sons she has brought up.</p>

<p>19. Both these things are befalling thee:
who will mourn for thee? Wasting and ruin,
famine and sword: who (but) I will comfort
thee? 20.&nbsp;Thy sons were faint; they lie at
the head of all the streets like a wild bull in a
net, filled with the wrath of Jehovah, the
rebuke of thy God. 21.&nbsp;Therefore pray hear
this, thou suffering one, and drunken, but
not with wine; 22.&nbsp;thus saith thy Lord,
Jehovah, and thy God&mdash;He will defend His
people&mdash;Behold, I have taken from thy hand
the cup of reeling, the bowl of the cup of My
fury; thou shalt not continue to drink it any
more. 23.&nbsp;And I put it into the hand of those
that afflicted thee, that said to thy soul, Bow
down and we will pass over; and thou didst
lay thy back as the ground, and as the street
for the passengers.</p>

<p>LII.&mdash;[However low the natural Israel may
sink, the true Church shall become more
glorious than ever, being freed from the impurities
connected with her former state, ver.
1. This is described as a captivity from
which she is exhorted to escape, ver. 2. Her
emancipation is the fruit of God&rsquo;s gratuitous
compassion, ver. 3. As a nation she has
suffered long enough, vers. 4, 5. The day is
coming when the Israel of God shall know in
whom they have believed, ver. 6. The herald
of the new dispensation is described as already
visible upon the mountains, ver. 7. The very
ruins of Jerusalem are summoned to rejoice,
ver. 9. The glorious change is witnessed by
the whole world. 10. The true church or
Israel of God is exhorted to come out of
Jewry, ver. 11. This exodus is likened to the
one from Egypt, but described as even more
<span class="pagenum" id="pA65L">[p.&nbsp;A65L]</span>
auspicious, ver. 12. Its great leader, the
Messiah, as the Servant of Jehovah, must be
and is to be exalted, ver. 13. And this
exaltation shall bear due proportion to the
humiliation which preceded it, vers. 14, 15.]</p>

<p>1. Awake, awake, put on thy strength, O
Zion! Put on thy garments of beauty, O
Jerusalem, the Holy City! For no more
shall there continue to come into thee an
uncircumcised and unclean (person).
2.&nbsp;Shake thyself from the dust, arise, sit, O
Jerusalem! loose the bands of thy neck, O
captive daughter of Zion!</p>

<p>3. For thus saith the Lord Jehovah, Ye
were sold for nought, and not for money shall
ye be redeemed. 4.&nbsp;For thus saith the Lord
Jehovah, Into Egypt went down My people
at the first to sojourn there, and Assyria
oppressed them for nothing. 5.&nbsp;And now
what have I here, saith Jehovah, that My
people is taken away for nothing, its rulers
howl, saith Jehovah, and continually, all the
day, My name is blasphemed? 6.&nbsp;Therefore
My people shall know My name; therefore in
that day (shall they know) that I am He that
said, Behold Me!</p>

<p>7. How timely on the mountains are the
feet of one bringing glad tidings, publishing
peace, bringing tidings of good, publishing
salvation, saying to Zion, Thy God reigneth!
8.&nbsp;The voice of thy watchmen! They raise
the voice, together will they shout; for eye
to eye will they see in Jehovah&rsquo;s returning
to Zion. 9.&nbsp;Burst forth, shout together,
ruins of Jerusalem! For Jehovah hath comforted
His people, hath redeemed Jerusalem.
10.&nbsp;Jehovah hath bared His holy arm to the
eyes of all the nations, and all the ends of the
earth have seen the salvation of our God.</p>

<p>11. Away! away! go out from thence! the
unclean touch not! come out from the midst
of her! Be clean, ye armour-bearers of
Jehovah. 12.&nbsp;For not in haste shall ye go
out, and in flight ye shall not depart; for
going before you (is) Jehovah, and bringing
up your rear the God of Israel.</p>

<p>LII. 13.&mdash;[The great leader of this exodus,
the Messiah, as the Servant of Jehovah, must
be and is to be exalted, ver. 13. And this
exaltation shall bear due proportion to the
humiliation which preceded it, vers. 14, 15.</p>

<p>LIII.&mdash;Notwithstanding these and other prophecies
of the Messiah, He is not recognised
when He appears, ver. 1. He is not the object
of desire and trust, for whom the great mass
of the people have been waiting, ver. 2. Nay,
His low condition, and especially His sufferings
are vicarious, not accidental or incurred
by His own fault, vers. 4&ndash;6. Hence, though
personally innocent, He is perfectly unresisting,
ver. 7. Even they for whom He suffers
may mistake His person and His office, ver.
8. His case presents the two extremes of
<span class="pagenum" id="pA66L">[p.&nbsp;A66L]</span>
righteous punishment and perfect innocence,
ver. 9. But the glorious fruit of these very
sufferings will correct all errors, ver. 10. He
becomes a Saviour only by becoming a substitute,
ver. 11. Even after the work of
expiation is completed, and His glorious reward
secured, the work of intercession will be
still continued, ver. 12.]</p>

<p>13. Behold, my Servant shall do wisely,
shall rise and be exalted and high exceedingly.
14.&nbsp;As many were shocked at Thee&mdash;so marred
from man His look, and His form from the
sons of men&mdash;15.&nbsp;so shall He sprinkle many
nations; concerning Him shall kings stop
their mouth, because what was not recounted
to them they have seen, and what they had
not heard they have perceived.</p>

<p>LIII.&mdash;1. Who hath believed our report? and
the arm of Jehovah, to whom (or, upon whom)
has it been revealed?</p>

<p>2. And He came up like the tender plant
before Him, and like a root from a dry ground;
He had no form nor comeliness, and we shall
see Him, and no sight that we should desire
it. 3.&nbsp;Despised and forsaken of men (or
ceasing from among men), a man of sorrows
and acquainted with sickness, and like one
hiding the face from Him (or, us), despised,
and we esteemed Him not.</p>

<p>4. Surely our sicknesses He bore, and our
griefs He carried; and we thought Him
stricken, smitten of God and afflicted.
5.&nbsp;And He was pierced (or, wounded) for our
transgression, bruised (or, crushed) for our
iniquities; the chastisement (or, punishment)
for our peace (was) upon Him, and by His
stripes we were healed. 6.&nbsp;And we like sheep
had gone astray, each to his own way we had
turned, and Jehovah laid on Him the iniquity
of us all.</p>

<p>7. He was oppressed and He humbled Himself,
and He will not open His mouth&mdash;as a
lamb to the slaughter is brought, and as a
sheep before its shearers is dumb&mdash;and He
will not open His mouth. 8.&nbsp;From distress
and from judgment He was taken; and in His
generation who will think, that He was cut
off from the land of the living; for the transgression
of my people (as) a curse for them?
9.&nbsp;And He gave with wicked (men) His grave,
and with a rich (man) in His death; because
(or, although) He had done no violence, and no
deceit (was) in His mouth.</p>

<p>10. And Jehovah was pleased to crush (or,
bruise Him), He put Him to grief (or, made
Him sick); if (or, when) His soul shall make
an offering for sin, He shall see (His) seed, He
shall prolong (His) days, and the pleasure of
Jehovah in His hand shall prosper. 11.&nbsp;From
the labour of His soul (or, life) He shall see,
He shall be satisfied; by His knowledge shall
<span class="pagenum" id="pA68L">[p.&nbsp;A68L]</span>
my servant (as) a righteous one, give righteousness
to many, and their iniquities He will
bear. 12.&nbsp;Therefore will I divide to Him
among the many, and with the strong shall
He divide the spoil, in lieu of this that He
bared unto death His soul, and with the transgressors
was numbered, and He (Himself) bare
the sin of many, and for the transgressors He
shall make intercession.</p>

<p>LIV.&mdash;[Instead of suffering from the loss of
her national prerogatives, the Church shall be
more glorious and productive than before,
ver. 1. Instead of being limited to a single
nation, she shall be so extended as to take in
all the nations of the earth, vers. 2, 3. What
seemed at first to be her forlorn and desolate
condition shall be followed by a glorious
change, ver. 4. He who seemed to be the
God of the Jews only shall now be seen to be
the God of the Gentiles also, ver. 5. The
abrogation of the old economy was like the
repudiation of a wife, but its effects will show
it to be rather a renewal of the conjugal
relation, ver. 6. The momentary rejection
shall be followed by an everlasting reconciliation,
vers. 7, 8. The old economy, like
Noah&rsquo;s flood, can never be repeated, ver. 9.
That was a temporary institution; this shall
outlast the earth itself, ver. 10. The old
Jerusalem shall be forgotten in the splendour
of the new, vers. 11, 12. But this shall be a
spiritual splendour, springing from a constant
Divine influence, ver. 13. Hence it shall be
also a holy and a safe state, ver. 14. All the
enemies of the Church shall either be destroyed
or received into her bosom, ver. 15. The
warrior and his weapons are alike God&rsquo;s creatures
and at His disposal, ver. 16. In every
conflict, both of hand and tongue, the Church
shall be triumphant, not in her own right or
her own strength, but in that of Him who
justifies, pardons, and saves her, ver. 17.]</p>

<p>1. Shout, O barren, that didst not bear;
break forth into a shout and cry aloud, thou
that didst not writhe (in childbirth): for more
(are) the children of the desolate than the
children of the married (woman), saith Jehovah.
2.&nbsp;Widen the place of thy tent,
and the curtains of thy dwelling let them
stretch out; spare not (or, hinder it not);
lengthen thy cords and strengthen (or, make
fast) thy stakes. 3.&nbsp;For right and left shalt
thou break forth (or, spread), and thy seed
shall possess (or, dispossess or inherit) nations,
and repeople ruined (or, forsaken) cities.</p>

<p>4. Fear not, for thou shalt not be ashamed;
and be not abashed, for thou shalt not blush;
for the shame of thy youth thou shalt forget,
and the reproach of thy widowhood thou shalt
not remember any more. 5.&nbsp;For thy husband
<span class="pagenum" id="pA69L">[p.&nbsp;A69L]</span>
(is) thy Maker, Jehovah of hosts is His
name; and thy Redeemer (is) the Holy One
of Israel, the God of all the earth shall He be
called. 6.&nbsp;For as a wife forsaken and grieved
of spirit has Jehovah called thee, and (as) a
wife of youth, for she shall be rejected, said
thy God. 7.&nbsp;In a little moment I forsook
thee, and in great mercies I will gather thee.
8.&nbsp;In a gush of wrath I hid My face for a
moment from thee, and in everlasting kindness
I have had mercy on thee, saith thy
Redeemer, Jehovah. 9.&nbsp;For the waters of
Noah is this to Me; what I sware from the
waters of Noah passing again over the earth
[<i>i.e.,</i> that they should not pass], so have I
sworn from being angry [that I will not be
angry] against thee, and from rebuking [that
I will not] rebuke thee. 10.&nbsp;For the mountains
shall move and the hills shall shake;
but My favour from thee shall not move, and
My covenant of peace shall not shake, saith
thy pitier, Jehovah. 11.&nbsp;Wretched, storm-tossed,
<span class="pagenum" id="pA70L">[p.&nbsp;A70L]</span>
comfortless! Behold, I am laying (or,
about to lay) thy stones in antimony, and I
will found thee upon sapphires; 12.&nbsp;and I will
make thy battlements (or, pinnacles) ruby, and
thy gates to (be) sparkling gems, and all thy
borders to (be) stones of pleasure (or delight).
13.&nbsp;And all thy children disciples of Jehovah,
and great (or, plentiful) the peace of thy
children. 14.&nbsp;In righteousness shalt thou be
established: be far from oppression, for thou
shalt not fear, and from destruction, for it
shall not come near to thee. 15.&nbsp;Lo, they
shall gather, they shall gather, not at My
sign (or, signal). Who has gathered against
thee? He shall fall away to thee. 16.&nbsp;Lo,
I have created the smith, blowing into the
fire of coal, and bringing out a weapon for
his work; and I have created the wasters to
destroy. 17.&nbsp;Every weapon (that) shall be
formed against thee shall not prosper, and
every tongue that shall rise with thee in
judgment thou shalt condemn. This is the
heritage of the servants of Jehovah, and their
righteousness from Me, saith Jehovah.</p>

<p>LV.&mdash;[By the removal of the old restrictions,

covenant, ver. 3. The Messiah is a witness of
the truth and a commander of the nations,
ver. 4. As such He will be recognised by

true religion, ver. 5. These are now addressed
directly, and exhorted to embrace the offered
opportunity, ver. 6. To this there is every
encouragement afforded in the Divine mercy,

This blessed renovation, being directly promotive
of God&rsquo;s glory, shall endure for ever,
ver. 13.]</p>

<p>1. Ho, every thirsty one, come ye to the
waters; and he to whom there is no money,
come ye, buy (food) and eat; and come, buy,
without money and without price, wine and
milk. 2.&nbsp;Why will ye weigh money for (that
which is) not bread, and your labour for
(that which is) not to satiety? Hearken,
hearken unto me, and eat (that which is)
good, and your soul shall enjoy itself in
<span class="pagenum" id="pA71L">[p.&nbsp;A71L]</span>
fatness. 3.&nbsp;Incline your ear and come unto
me, hear and your soul shall live (or, let it
live), and I will make with you an everlasting
covenant, the sure mercies of David. 4.&nbsp;Lo,
(as) a witness of nations I have given him, a
chief and commander of nations. 5.&nbsp;Lo, a
nation (that) thou knowest not shalt thou
call, and a nation (that) have not known thee
shall run unto thee, for the sake of Jehovah
thy God, and for the Holy One of Israel, for
He hath glorified thee.</p>

<p>6. Seek ye Jehovah while He may be found;
call ye upon Him while He is near. 7.&nbsp;Let
the wicked forsake his way, and the man of
iniquity his thoughts, and let him return
unto Jehovah, and He will have mercy upon
him, and to our God for He will abundantly
pardon (literally, multiply to pardon).
8.&nbsp;For My thoughts (are) not as your thoughts,
nor your ways My ways, saith Jehovah.
9.&nbsp;For (as) the heavens are higher than the
earth, so are My ways higher than your ways,
and My thoughts than your thoughts.</p>

<p>10. For as the rain cometh down, and the
snow from heaven, and thither returneth
not, but when it has watered the earth and
made it bear and put forth, and has given
seed to the sower and bread to the eater,
11.&nbsp;so shall My word be, which goeth out of
My mouth: it shall not return unto Me void
(or, without effect), but when it has done that
which I desired, and successfully done that
for which I sent it. 12.&nbsp;For with joy shall
ye go forth, and in peace shall ye be led; the
mountains and the hills shall break out before
you into a shout, and all the trees of the
field shall clap the hand. 13.&nbsp;Instead of the
thorn shall come up the cypress, and instead
of the nettle shall come up the myrtle, and it
shall be to Jehovah for a name, for an everlasting
sign that shall not be cut off.</p>

<p>LVI.&mdash;[The day is coming when the righteousness
of God is to be fully revealed, without
the veils and shackles which had hitherto confined
it, ver. 1. For this great change, the
best preparation is fidelity to the spirit of the
old economy, ver. 2. No personal or national
distinctions will be any longer recognised,
ver. 3. Connection with the Church will no
longer be a matter of hereditary right, vers. 4,
5. The Church shall be henceforth coextensive
with the world, vers. 6&ndash;8. But first the carnal
Israel must be abandoned to its enemies, ver. 9.
Its rulers are neither able nor worthy to deliver
the people or themselves, ver. 10&ndash;12.]</p>

<p>1. Thus saith Jehovah, Keep ye judgment
(or justice) and do righteousness; for near
(is) My salvation to come, and My righteousness
to be revealed. 2.&nbsp;Happy the man (that)
shall do this, and the son of man that shall
hold it fast, keeping the Sabbath from profaning
it, and keeping the hand from doing
evil.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="pA72L">[p.&nbsp;A72L]</span>
3. And let not the foreigner say, who has
joined himself unto Jehovah, saying, Jehovah
will separate me wholly from His people; and
let not the eunuch say, Lo, I am a dry tree.
4.&nbsp;For thus saith Jehovah to (or, as to) the
eunuchs, who shall keep My Sabbaths, and
shall choose what I delight in, and take fast
hold of My covenant, 5.&nbsp;I will give to them
in My house and within My walls a place and
a name better than sons and than daughters;
an everlasting name will I give to him, which
shall not be cut off. 6.&nbsp;And (as to) the
foreigners joining themselves to Jehovah to
serve Him and to love the name of Jehovah,
to be to him for servants, every one keeping
the Sabbath from profaning it, and holding
fast my covenant; 7.&nbsp;I will bring them to
My mount of holiness, and make them joyful
in My house of prayer, their offerings and
their sacrifices (shall be) acceptance on My
altar; for My house shall be called a house of
prayer for all nations. 8.&nbsp;Thus saith the
Lord Jehovah, the gatherer of the outcasts of
Israel, Still (more) will I gather upon him
(in addition) to his gathered.</p>

<p>9. All ye beasts of the field, come to devour,
all ye beasts in the forest! 10.&nbsp;His watchmen
(are) blind all of them, they have not
known (or, do not know); all of them (are)
dumb dogs, they cannot bark, dreaming, lying
down, loving to slumber. 11.&nbsp;And the dogs
are greedy, they know not satiety, and they,
the shepherds (or, the shepherds themselves),
know not how to distinguish (or, act wisely):
all of them to their own way are turned, (every)
man to his own gain from his own quarter (or,
without exception). 12.&nbsp;Come ye, I will fetch
wine, and we will intoxicate ourselves with
strong drink, and like to-day (shall be) to-morrow,
great, abundantly, exceedingly.</p>

<p>LVII.&mdash;[The righteous who died under the
old economy were taken away from the evil
to come, vers. 1, 2. The wicked who despised
them were themselves proper objects of contempt,
vers. 3, 4. Their idolatry is first described
in literal terms, vers. 5, 6. It is then
represented as a spiritual idolatry, vers. 7&ndash;9.
Their obstinate persistence in sin is represented
as the cause of their hopeless and
remediless destruction, vers. 10&ndash;13. A way
is prepared for spiritual Israel to come out
from among them, vers. 14. The hopes of true
believers shall not be deferred for ever, vers.
15, 16. Even these must be chastened for
their sins, ver. 17. But there is favour in
reserve for all true penitents, without regard
to national distinctions, vers. 18. 19. To the
incorrigible sinner, on the other hand, peace
is impossible, vers. 20, 21.]</p>

<p>1. The righteous perisheth, and there is no
man laying (it) to heart, and men of mercy
are taken away, with none considering (or
<span class="pagenum" id="pA73L">[p.&nbsp;A73L]</span>
perceiving) that from the presence of evil the
righteous is taken away. 2.&nbsp;He shall go in
peace (or, enter into peace); they shall rest
upon their beds&mdash;walking straight before him.</p>

<p>3. And ye (or, as for you), draw near hither,
ye sons of the witch, seed of the adulterer and
the harlot. 4.&nbsp;At whom do ye amuse yourselves?
At whom do ye enlarge the mouth,
prolong the tongue? Are ye not children of
rebellion (or, apostasy), a seed of falsehood?
5.&nbsp;Inflamed (or, inflaming yourselves) among
the oaks (or, terebinths), under every green
tree, slaughtering the children in the valleys,
under the clefts of the rocks. 6.&nbsp;Among the
smooth (stones) of the valley (or, the brook) is
thy portion; they, they are thy lot; also to
them hast thou poured out a drink-offering,
thou hast brought up a meat-offering. Shall
I for these things be consoled (<i>i.e.,</i> satisfied
without revenge)?</p>

<p>7. On a high and elevated mountain thou
hast placed thy bed; also there (or, even
thither) hast thou gone up to offer sacrifice.
8.&nbsp;And behind the door and the door-post
thou hast placed thy memorial, far away
from me thou hast uncovered (thyself or thy
bed), and hast gone up, thou hast enlarged
thy bed and hast covenanted from them, thou
hast loved their bed, thou hast provided room.
9.&nbsp;And thou hast gone to the king in oil, and
hast multiplied thine unguents, and hast sent
thine ambassadors even to a far-off (land), and
hast gone (or, sent) down even to hell.</p>

<p>10. In the greatness of thy way (or, the abundance
of thy travel) thou hast labour; (but) thou
hast not said, There is no hope. Thou hast
found the life of thy hand; therefore thou art
not weak. 11.&nbsp;And whom hast thou feared
and been afraid of, that thou shouldst lie?
And Me thou hast not remembered, thou
hast not called to mind (or, laid to heart). Is
it not (because) I hold My peace, and that
of old, that thou wilt not fear Me? 12.&nbsp;I
will declare thy righteousness and thy works,
and they shall not profit (or, avail) thee.
13.&nbsp;In thy crying (<i>i.e.,</i> when thou criest for help),
let thy gatherings save thee! And (yet) all of
them the wind shall take up, and a breath shall
take away, and the (one) trusting in Me shall inherit
the land and possess My holy mountain.</p>

<p>14. And he shall say, Cast up, cast up,
clear the way, take up the stumbling-block
from the way of the people! 15.&nbsp;For thus
saith the High and Exalted One, inhabiting
eternity, and Holy is His name: On
high and holy will I dwell, and with the
broken and humble of spirit, to revive the
<span class="pagenum" id="pA74L">[p.&nbsp;A74L]</span>
spirit of the humble and to retrieve the heart of
the broken (or, contrite ones). 16.&nbsp;For not to
eternity will I contend, and not to perpetuity
will I be wroth; for the spirit from before Me
will faint, and the souls (which) I have made.</p>

<p>17. For his covetous iniquity I am wroth
and will smite him, (I will) hide Me and will
be wroth; for he has gone on turning away
(<i>i.e.,</i> persevering in apostasy) in the way of
his heart (or, of his own inclination).
18.&nbsp;His ways I have seen, and I will heal him,
and will guide him, and restore comforts unto
him and to his mourners. 19.&nbsp;Creating the
fruit of the lips, Peace, peace to the far off and
to the near, saith Jehovah, and I will heal him.</p>

<p>20. And the wicked (are) like the troubled
sea, for rest it cannot, and its waters cast up
mire and dirt. 21.&nbsp;There is no peace, saith
my God, to the wicked.</p>

<p>LVIII.&mdash;[The rejection of Israel as a nation
is the just reward of their unfaithfulness, ver.
1. Their religious services are hypocritical,
ver. 2. Their mortifications and austerities
are nullified by accompanying wickedness,
vers. 3-5. They should have been connected
with the opposite virtues, vers. 6, 7. In that
case they would have continued to enjoy the
divine favour, vers. 8, 9. They are still invited
to make trial of this course, with an
ample promise of prosperity and blessing to
encourage them, vers. 10&ndash;14.]</p>

<p>1. Cry with the throat, spare not, like the
trumpet raise thy voice, and tell to My people
their transgression, and to the house of Jacob
their sins.</p>

<p>2. And Me day (by) day they will seek, and
the knowledge of My ways they will delight in
(or, desire), like a nation which has done right,
and the judgment of its God has not forsaken;
they will ask of Me righteous judgments, the
approach to God (or, of God) they will delight
in (or, desire).</p>

<p>3. Why have we fasted, and Thou hast not
seen (it)? afflicted our soul (or, themselves) and
Thou wilt not know (it)? Behold in the day of
your fast ye will find pleasure, and all your
labours ye will exact. 4.&nbsp;Behold, for strife and
contention ye will fast, and to smite with the
flat of wickedness; ye shall not (or, ye will not)
fast to-day (so as) to make your voice heard on
high. 5.&nbsp;Shall it be like this, the fast that I
will choose, the day of man&rsquo;s humbling himself?
Is it to hang his head like a bulrush,
and make sackcloth and ashes his bed? Wilt
thou call this a fast, and a day of acceptance
(an acceptable day) to Jehovah?</p>

<p>6. Is not this the fast that I will choose, to
loosen bands of wickedness, to undo the fastenings
of the yoke, and to send away the crushed
(or broken) free, and every yoke ye shall
<span class="pagenum" id="pA75L">[p.&nbsp;A75L]</span>
break? 7.&nbsp;Is it not to break unto the hungry
thy bread? and the afflicted, the homeless,
thou shalt bring home; for thou shalt see one
naked and shalt clothe him, and from thine
own flesh thou shalt not hide thyself.</p>

<p>8. Then shall break forth as the dawn thy
light, and thy healing speedily shall spring
up; then shall go before thee thy righteousness,
and the glory of Jehovah shall be thy
rereward (or, bring up thy rear). 9.&nbsp;Then
shalt thou call, and Jehovah will answer; thou
shalt cry, and He will say, Behold Me (here I
am), if thou wilt put away from the midst of
thee the yoke, the pointing of the finger,
and the speaking of vanity.</p>

<p>10. And (if) thou wilt let out thy soul to the
hungry, and the afflicted soul will satisfy, then
shall thy sight arise in the darkness, and thy
gloom as the (double light or) noon. 11.&nbsp;And
Jehovah will guide thee over, and satisfy thy soul
in drought, and thy bones shall He invigorate,
and thou shalt be like a watered garden, and
like a spring of water whose waters shall not
fail. 12.&nbsp;And they shall build from thee
the ruins of antiquity (or, perpetuity), foundations
of age and age (<i>i.e.,</i> of ages) shalt thou
raise up: and it shall be called to thee (or,
thou shalt be called) Repairer of the breach,
Restorer of paths for dwelling.</p>

<p>13. If thou wilt turn away thy foot from
the Sabbath to do thy pleasure on My holy
day, and wilt call the Sabbath a delight (and)
the holy (day) of Jehovah honourable, and
wilt honour it by not doing thy own ways, by
not finding thy pleasure and talking talk;
14.&nbsp;then shalt thou be happy in Jehovah,
and I will make thee rule upon the heights of
the earth, and I will make thee eat the heritage
of Jacob thy father, for Jehovah&rsquo;s mouth hath
spoken it.</p>

<p>LIX.&mdash;[The fault of Israel&rsquo;s rejection is not
in the Lord, but in themselves, vers. 1, 2. They
are charged with sins of violence and injustice,
vers. 3, 4. The ruinous effects of these
corruptions are described, vers. 5, 6. Their
violence and injustice are fatal to themselves
and to others, vers. 7, 8. The moral condition
of the people is described as one of darkness
and hopeless degradation, vers. 9&ndash;15. In this
extremity, Jehovah interposes to deliver the
true Israel, vers. 16, 17. This can only be
effected by the destruction of the carnal Israel,
vers. 18. The Divine presence shall no longer
be subjected to local restrictions, vers. 19. A
Redeemer shall appear in Zion to save the true
Israel, vers. 20. The old dispensation shall
give place to the dispensation of the Word
and Spirit, which shall last for ever, ver. 21.]</p>

<p>1. Behold, not shortened is Jehovah&rsquo;s hand
from saving, and not benumbed is His ear
<span class="pagenum" id="pA76L">[p.&nbsp;A76L]</span>
from hearing. 2.&nbsp;But your iniquities have
been separating between you and your God,
and your sins have hid (His) face from you,
so as not to hear.</p>

<p>3. For your hands are defiled with blood,
and your fingers with iniquity; your lips
have spoken falsehood, your tongue will utter
wickedness. 4.&nbsp;There is none calling with
justice, and there is none contending with
truth; they trust in vanity and speak falsehood,
conceive mischief and bring forth
iniquity. 5.&nbsp;Eggs of the basilisk they have
hatched, and webs of the spider they will
spin (or, weave); the one eating their eggs
shall die, and the crushed (egg) shall
hatch out a viper. 6.&nbsp;The webs shall not
become (or, be for) clothing, and they shall
not cover themselves with their works: their
works are works of mischief (or, iniquity), and
the doing of violence is in their hands.
7.&nbsp;Their feet to evil will run, and they will hasten
to shed innocent blood; their thoughts
are thoughts of mischief (or, iniquity); wasting
and ruin are in their paths. 8.&nbsp;The way
of peace they have not known, and there is no
justice in their paths; their courses they have
rendered crooked for them; every one walking
in them knows not peace.</p>

<p>9. Therefore is judgment far from us, and
righteousness will not overtake us; we wait
for light, and behold darkness; for splendours,
(and) in obscurities we walk. 10.&nbsp;We grope like
the blind for the wall, like the eyeless we grope;
we stumble at noon-day as in twilight, in thick
darkness like the dead. 11.&nbsp;We growl like
the bears, all of us, and like the doves we
moan; we wait for justice and there is none,
for salvation (and) it is far from us. 12.&nbsp;For
our transgressions are multiplied before Thee,
and our sins testify against us; for our transgressions
are with us, and our iniquities&mdash;we
know them; 13.&nbsp;to transgress and lie against
Jehovah, and to turn back from behind our
God, to speak oppression and departure, to
conceive and utter from the heart words of
falsehood. 14.&nbsp;And judgment is thrust (or,
driven) back, and righteousness afar off stands;
for truth is fallen in the street, and uprightness
cannot enter. 15.&nbsp;Then truth was missed
(<i>i.e.,</i> found wanting), and whoso departed from
evil made himself a prey (or, was plundered).</p>

<p>Then Jehovah saw it, and it was evil in His
eyes that there was no judgment (or, practical
justice). 16.&nbsp;And He saw that there was no
man, and He stood aghast that there was no
one interposing; and His own arm saved for
Him, and His own righteousness, it upheld
<span class="pagenum" id="pA77L">[p.&nbsp;A77L]</span>
Him. 17.&nbsp;And He clothed Himself with righteousness
as a coat of mail, and a helmet of salvation
on His head, and He clothed Himself
with garments of vengeance (for) clothing.
18.&nbsp;According to (their) deeds, according will
He repay, wrath to His enemies, (their) desert
to His foes, to the isles (their) desert will He
repay. 19.&nbsp;And they shall fear from the
west the name of Jehovah, and from the
rising of the sun His glory; for it shall come
like a straitened stream, the spirit of Jehovah
raising a banner in it.</p>

<p>20. Then shall come for Zion a Redeemer,
and for the converts from apostasy in Jacob,
saith Jehovah. 21.&nbsp;And I (or, as for me)&mdash;this
(is) My covenant with them, saith Jehovah.
My Spirit which is on thee, and My
words which I have placed in thy mouth,
shall not depart out of thy mouth, nor out of the
mouth of thy seed&rsquo;s seed, saith Jehovah,
from henceforth and for ever (or, from now
and to eternity).</p>

<p>LX.&mdash;[The prophet describes the approaching
change as a new and Divine light rising upon
Zion, ver. 1. He contrasts it with the darkness
of surrounding nations, ver. 2. Yet
these are not excluded from participation in
the light, ver. 3. The elect in every nation
are the children of the Church, and shall be
gathered to her, vers. 4, 5. On one side he
sees the Oriental caravans and flocks approaching,
vers. 6, 7. On the other, the commercial
fleets of western nations, vers. 8, 9. What
seemed rejection is in fact the highest favour,
ver. 10. The glory of the true Church is her
freedom from local and national restrictions,
ver. 11. None are excluded from her pale
but those who exclude themselves and thereby
perish, ver. 12. External nature shall contribute
to her splendour, ver. 13. Her very
enemies shall do her homage, ver. 14. Instead
of being cast off, she is glorified for ever, ver. 15.
Instead of being identified with one nation, she
shall derive support from all, ver. 16. All that
is changed in her condition shall be changed
for the better, ver. 17. The evils of her former
state are done away, ver. 18. Even some of its
advantages are now superfluous, ver. 19. What
remains shall be no longer precarious, ver. 20.
The splendour of this new dispensation is a
moral and spiritual splendour, but attended
by external safety and protection, ver. 21,
22. All this shall certainly and promptly
come to pass at the appointed time, ver. 22.]</p>

<p>1. Arise, be light; for thy light is come,
and the glory of Jehovah has risen upon thee.
2.&nbsp;For behold, the darkness shall cover the
earth, and a gloom the nations, and upon thee
shall Jehovah rise, and His glory upon thee
<span class="pagenum" id="pA78L">[p.&nbsp;A78L]</span>
shall be seen. 3.&nbsp;And nations shall walk in thy
light, and kings in the brightness of thy rising.</p>

<p>4. Lift up thine eyes round about (<i>i.e.,</i>
in all directions) and see; all of them are
gathered, they come to thee, thy sons from
afar shall come, and thy daughters at the side
shall be borne. 5.&nbsp;Then shalt thou see (or, fear),
and brighten up (or, overflow), and thy heart
shall throb and swell; because (or, when) the
abundance of the sea shall be turned upon thee,
the strength of nations shall come unto thee.</p>

<p>6. A stream of camels shall cover thee,
young camels (or, dromedaries) of Midian and
Ephah, all of them from Sheba shall come,
gold and incense shall they bear, and the
praises of Jehovah as good news. 7.&nbsp;All the
flocks of Kedar shall be gathered for thee, the
rams of Nebaioth shall minister to thee, they
shall ascend with good-will (or, acceptably) My
altar, and My house of beauty I will beautify.</p>

<p>8. Who are these that fly as a cloud and as
doves to their windows? 9.&nbsp;Because for Me
the isles are waiting (or, must wait) and the
ships of Tarshish in the first place, to bring
thy sons from far, their silver and their gold
with them, for the name of Jehovah thy God,
and for the Holy One of Israel, because He has
glorified thee.</p>

<p>10. And strangers shall build thy walls, and
their kings shall serve thee; for in My wrath
I smote thee, and in My favour I have had
mercy on thee. 11.&nbsp;And thy gates shall be
open continually, day and night they shall
not be shut, to bring into thee the strength
of nations and their kings led (captive, or, in
triumph). 12.&nbsp;For the nation and the kingdom
which will not serve thee shall perish,
and the nations shall be desolated, desolated.</p>

<p>13. The glory of Lebanon to thee shall
come, cypress, plane, and box together, to
adorn the place of My sanctuary, and the
place of My feet I will honour.</p>

<p>14. Then shall come to thee bending the
sons of thy oppressors, then shall bow down to
the soles of thy feet all thy despisers, and shall
call thee the City of Jehovah, Zion the holy
place of Israel (or, the Zion of the Holy One of
Israel).</p>

<p>15. Instead of thy being forsaken and
hated, and with none passing (through thee),
and I will place thee for a boast of perpetuity,
a joy of age and age. 16.&nbsp;And they
shalt suck the milk of nations, and the breast
of kings shalt thou suck, and thou shalt know
that I, Jehovah, am thy Saviour, and (that)
thy Redeemer (is) the Mighty One of Jacob.
17.&nbsp;Instead of brass (or, copper) I will bring
gold, and instead of iron I will bring silver,
and instead of wood brass, and instead of
stones iron, and I will place (or, make) thy
government peace, and thy rulers righteousness.</p>

<p>18. There shall be no more heard violence
in thy land, desolation and ruin in thy
<span class="pagenum" id="pA79L">[p.&nbsp;A79L]</span>
borders (or, within thy bounds); and thou shalt
call salvation thy walls, and thy gates praise.
19.&nbsp;No more shall be to thee the sun for a
light by day, and for brightness the moon
shall not shine to thee, and Jehovah shall
become thy everlasting light, and thy God
thy glory. 20.&nbsp;The sun shall set no more,
and thy moon shall not be withdrawn; for
Jehovah shall be unto thee an eternal light,
and completed the days of thy mourning.
21.&nbsp;And thy people, all of them righteous, for
ever shall inherit the earth, the branch (or,
shoot) of My planting, the work of My hands,
to glorify Myself (or, to be glorified). 22.&nbsp;The
little one shall become a thousand, and the
small one a strong nation; I, Jehovah, in its
time will hasten it.</p>

<p>LXI.&mdash;[After describing the new condition
of the Church, he again introduces the great
Personage by whom the change is to be brought
about. His mission and its object are described
by Himself in vers. 1&ndash;3. Its grand
result shall be the restoration of a ruined
world, ver. 4. The Church, as a mediator
between God and the revolted nations, shall
enjoy their solace and support, vers. 5, 6.
The shame of God&rsquo;s people shall be changed
to honour, ver. 7. The Church once restricted
as a single nation, shall be recognised and
honoured among all, ver. 9. He triumphs in
the prospect of the universal spread of truth
and righteousness, vers. 10, 11.]</p>

<p>1. The Spirit of the Lord Jehovah (is) upon
me, because Jehovah hath anointed me to
bring good news to the humble, He hath sent
me to bind up the broken in heart, to proclaim
to captives freedom, and to the bound open
opening (of the eyes or of the prison doors);
2.&nbsp;to proclaim a year of favour for Jehovah,
and a day of vengeance for our God; to comfort
all mourners, 3.&nbsp;to put upon Zion&rsquo;s
mourners&mdash;to give them a crown instead of
ashes, the oil of joy for mourning, a garment
of praise for a faint spirit; and it shall be
called to them (or, they shall be called) the
oaks of righteousness, the planting of Jehovah
(<i>i.e.,</i> planted by Jehovah) to glorify Himself.</p>

<p>4. And they shall bind up the ruins of
antiquity, the desolations of the ancients they
shall raise, and shall renew the cities of ruin
(<i>i.e.,</i> ruined cities), the desolations of age and
age. 5.&nbsp;Then shall stand strangers and feed
your flocks, and the children of outland (shall
be) your ploughmen and your vine-dressers.
6.&nbsp;And ye (or more emphatically, as for you),
the priests of Jehovah shall ye be called, the
ministers of our God shall be said to you (or,
of you), the strength of nations shall ye eat,
and in their glory shall ye substitute yourselves.
7.&nbsp;Instead of your shame (ye shall
<span class="pagenum" id="pA80L">[p.&nbsp;A80L]</span>
have) double, and (instead of their) confusion
they shall celebrate their portion; therefore
in their land shall they inherit double, everlasting
joy shall be to them. 8.&nbsp;For I am
Jehovah, loving justice, hating (that which is)
taken away unjustly, and I will give their
hire truly, and an everlasting covenant I strike
for them. 9.&nbsp;Then shall be known among
the nations their seed, and their issue in the
midst of the peoples. All seeing them shall
acknowledge them that they are a seed Jehovah
has blessed.</p>

<p>10. (I will) joy, I will joy in Jehovah, let
my soul exult in my God; for He hath clothed
me with garments of salvation, a mantle of
righteousness has He put on me, as a bridegroom
adjusts his priestly crown, and as the
bride arrays her jewels. 11.&nbsp;For as the earth
puts forth its growth, and as the garden makes
its plants to grow, so shall the Lord Jehovah
make to grow righteousness and praise before
all the nations.</p>

<p>LXII.&mdash;[The words of the great Deliverer
are continued from the foregoing chapter.
He will not rest until the glorious change in
the condition of His people is accomplished,
ver. 1. They shall be recognised by kings
and nations as the people of Jehovah, vers. 2,
3. She who seemed to be forsaken is still His
spouse, vers. 4, 5. The Church is required to
watch and pray for the fulfilment of the promise,
vers. 6, 7. God has sworn to protect
her and supply her wants, ver. 8, 9. Instead
of a single nation, all the nations of the earth
shall flow unto her, ver 10. The good news
of salvation shall no longer be confined, but
universally diffused, ver 11. The glory of the
Church is the redemption of the world, ver. 12.]</p>

<p>1. For Zion&rsquo;s sake I will not be still, and
for Jerusalem&rsquo;s sake I will not rest, until her
righteousness go forth as brightness, and her
salvation as a lamp (that) burneth. 2.&nbsp;And
nations shall see thy righteousness, and all
kings thy glory; and there shall be called in
thee a new name, which the mouth of Jehovah
shall utter. 3.&nbsp;And thou shalt be a crown of
beauty in Jehovah&rsquo;s hand, and a diadem of
royalty in the palm of thy God. 4.&nbsp;No more
shall it be called to thee (shalt thou be called)
Azubah (Forsaken), and thy land shall no
more be called Shemamah (Desolate), but thou
shalt be called Hephzibah (my delight is in
her), and thy land Beulah (married), for
Jehovah delights in thee, and thy land shall
be married. 5.&nbsp;For (as) a young man marrieth
a virgin, (so) shall thy sons marry thee,
and (with) the joy of a bridegroom over a
bride shall thy God rejoice over thee.</p>

<p>6. On thy walls, O Jerusalem, I have set
watchmen; all the day and all the night long
they shall not be silent. Ye that remind Jehovah,
<span class="pagenum" id="pA81L">[p.&nbsp;A81L]</span>
let there be no rest to you, 7.&nbsp;and give no
rest to Him, until He establish and, until He
place Jerusalem a praise in the earth.</p>

<p>8. Sworn hath Jehovah by His right hand,
and by His arm of strength, If I give (<i>i.e.,</i> I will
not give) thy corn any more as food to thine
enemies, and if the sons of the outland shall
drink thy new wine which thou hast laboured
in (I am not God). 9.&nbsp;For those gathering it
shall eat it, and shall praise Jehovah, and those
collecting it shall drink it in My holy courts
(or, in the courts of My sanctuary). 10.&nbsp;Pass,
pass through the gates, clear the way of the
people, raise high, raise high the highway, free
(it) from stones, raise a banner (or, a signal)
over the nations. 11.&nbsp;Behold, Jehovah has
caused it to be heard to the end of the earth,
Say ye to the daughter of Zion, Behold thy
salvation cometh; behold, His reward is with
Him and His hire before Him. 12.&nbsp;And they
shall call them the Holy People, the redeemed
of Jehovah, and thou shalt be called Derushah
(sought for), Ir-lo-neczabah (city not
forsaken).</p>

<p>LXIII.&mdash;[The influx of the Gentiles into Zion
having been described in the preceding verses,
the destruction of her enemies is now sublimely
represented as a sanguinary triumph of Jehovah
or the Messiah, vers. 1&ndash;6. The prophet
then supposes the catastrophe already past, and
takes a retrospective view of God&rsquo;s compassion
towards His people, and of their unfaithfulness
during the old economy, vers. 7&ndash;14. He
assumes the tone of earnest supplication, such
as might have been offered by the believing
Jews when all seemed lost in the destruction
of the commonwealth and temple, vers.
15&ndash;19.]</p>

<p>LXIV.&mdash;[This chapter is inseparable from
the one before it. The strongest confidence
is expressed in the Divine power, founded
upon former experience, vers. 1&ndash;3. The two
great facts of Israel&rsquo;s rejection as a nation,
and the continued existence of the Church,
are brought together in ver. 4. The unworthiness
of Israel is acknowledged still more fully,
ver. 5, 6. The sovereign authority of God is
humbly recognised, ver. 7. His favour is
earnestly implored, ver. 8. The external
prerogatives of Israel are lost, ver. 9. But
will God for that cause cast off the true Israel,
His own people? ver. 10.]</p>

<p>1. Who (is) this coming from Edom, bright
(as to His) garments from Bozrah, this one
adorned in His apparel, bending in the abundance
of His strength?</p>

<p>I, speaking in righteousness, mighty to save.</p>

<p>2. Why (is there) redness to Thy raiment,
and (why are) Thy garments like (those of) one
treading in a wine-press?</p>

<p>3. The press I have trodden by Myself, and
<span class="pagenum" id="pA82L">[p.&nbsp;A82L]</span>
of the nations there was not a man with Me;
and I will tread them in My anger, and trample
them in My fury, and in their juice shall spirt
upon My garments, and all My vesture I have
stained. 4.&nbsp;For the day of vengeance (is) in
My heart, and the year of My redeemed is
come. 5.&nbsp;And I look, and there is none helping;
and I stand aghast, and there is none
sustaining; and My own arm saves for Me,
and My fury it sustains Me. 6.&nbsp;And I tread
the nations in My anger, and I make them
drunk in My wrath, and I bring down to the
earth their juice.</p>

<p>7. The mercies of Jehovah I will cause to
be remembered, the praises of Jehovah, according
to all that Jehovah hath done for us,
which He hath done for them, according to
His compassions, and according to the multitude
of His mercies.</p>

<p>8. And He said, Only they are My people,
(My) children shall not lie (or, deceive), and
He became a Saviour for them. 9.&nbsp;In all
their enmity He was not an enemy, and the
angel of His face (or, presence) saved them;
in His love and in His sparing mercy He redeemed
them, and He took them up and
carried them all the days of old. 10.&nbsp;And
they rebelled, and grieved His Holy Spirit (or,
Spirit of holiness), and He was turned from
them into an enemy, He himself fought against
them.</p>

<p>11. And he remembered the days of old,
Moses (and) his people. Where is He that
brought them up from the sea, the shepherd
of His flock? Where is He that put
within him His Holy Spirit? 12.&nbsp;Leading
them by the right hand of Moses (and) His
glorious arm, cleaving the waters from before
them, to make for Him an everlasting name?
13.&nbsp;Making them walk in the depths, like
the horse in the desert they shall not stumble.
14.&nbsp;As the herd into the valley will go down,
the Spirit of Jehovah will make him rest. So
didst Thou lead Thy people, to make for Thyself
a name of glory.</p>

<p>15. Look (down) from heaven and see from
Thy dwelling-place of holiness and beauty!
Where is Thy zeal and Thy might (or, mighty
deeds)? The sounding of Thy bowels and Thy
mercies towards me have withdrawn themselves.
16.&nbsp;For Thou (art) our Father; for
Abraham hath not known us, and Israel will
not recognise us; Thou Jehovah art our Father,
our Redeemer of old (or, from everlasting)
is Thy name. 17.&nbsp;Why wilt Thou make
us wander, O Jehovah, from Thy ways? (why)
wilt Thou harden our heart from Thy fear?
Return, for the sake of Thy servants, the tribes
<span class="pagenum" id="pA83L">[p.&nbsp;A83L]</span>
of Thy inheritance. 18.&nbsp;For a little Thy holy
people possessed, our enemies trod down Thy
sanctuary. 19.&nbsp;We are of old, Thou has not
ruled over them, Thy name has not been called
upon them. LXIV.&mdash;1.&nbsp;Oh that Thou wouldst rend the
heavens (and) come down, (that) from before
Thee the mountains might quake (or flow
down), 2.&nbsp;as fire kindles brush, fire
boils water&mdash;to make known Thy name to
Thine enemies, from before Thee nations
shall tremble. 3.&nbsp;In Thy doing fearful things
(which) we expect not, (oh that) Thou wouldst
come down, (that) the mountains before Thee
might flow down. 4.&nbsp;And from eternity they
have not heard, they have not perceived by
the ear, the eye hath not seen, a God beside
Thee (who) will do for (one) waiting for Him.</p>

<p>5. Thou hast met with one rejoicing and
executing righteousness; in Thy ways shall
they remember Thee; behold, Thou hast
been wroth, and we have sinned; in them
is perpetuity, and we shall be saved. 6.&nbsp;And
we were like the unclean all of us, and like
a filthy garment all our righteousness (virtues
or good works), and we faded like the
(fading) leaf all of us, and our iniquities
like the wind will take us up (or, carry us away).
7.&nbsp;And there is no one calling on Thy name,
rousing himself to lay hold on Thee; for
Thou hast hid Thy face from us, and hast
melted us because of (or, by means of) our
iniquities.</p>

<p>8. And now Jehovah, our Father (art) Thou,
we the clay and Thou our potter, and the
work of Thy hands (are) we all. 9.&nbsp;Be not
angry, O Jehovah, to extremity, and do not
to eternity remember guilt; lo, look, we pray
thee, Thy people (are) we all. 10.&nbsp;The holy
cities are a desert, Zion is a desert, Jerusalem
a waste. 11.&nbsp;Our house of holiness and
beauty (in) which our fathers praised Thee
has been burned up with fire, and all our
delights (or, desirable places) have become a
desolation. 12.&nbsp;Wilt Thou for these (things)
restrain Thyself, O Jehovah, wilt Thou keep
silence and afflict us to extremity?</p>

<p>LXV.&mdash;[The grand enigma of Israel&rsquo;s simultaneous
loss and gain is solved by a prediction
of the calling of the Gentiles, ver. 1. This
is connected with the obstinate unfaithfulness
<span class="pagenum" id="pA84L">[p.&nbsp;A84L]</span>
of the chosen people, ver. 2. They are represented
under the two main aspects of their
character at different periods, as gross idolaters
and as pharisaical bigots, vers. 3&ndash;5. Their
casting off was not occasioned by the sins of
one generation, but of many, vers. 6, 7. But
even in this rejected race there was a chosen
remnant, in whom the promises shall be fulfilled,
vers. 8&ndash;10. He then reverts to the
idolatrous Jews, and threatens them with condign
punishment, vers. 11, 12. The fate of
the unbelieving carnal Israel is compared
with that of the true spiritual Israel, vers. 13&ndash;16.
The gospel economy is described as a
new creation, ver. 17. Its blessings are represented
under glowing figures borrowed from
the old dispensation, vers. 18&ndash;19. Premature
death shall be no longer known, ver. 20.
Possession and enjoyment shall no longer be
precarious, vers. 21&ndash;23. Their very desires
shall be anticipated, ver. 24. All animosities
and noxious influences shall cease for ever,
ver. 25.]</p>

<p>1. I have been inquired of by those that
asked not, I have been found by those that
sought Me not; I have said, Behold Me, behold
Me, to a nation (that) was not called by My
name. 2.&nbsp;I have spread (or, stretched) out My
hands all the day (or, every day) to a rebellious
people, those going the way not good, after
their own thoughts (or, designs)&mdash;3.&nbsp;the
people angering Me to My face continually,
sacrificing in the gardens, and censing on the
bricks; 4.&nbsp;sitting in the graves, and in the
holes they will lodge, eating the flesh of swine,
and broth of filthy things (is in) their vessels;
5.&nbsp;the (men) saying, Keep to thyself, come
not near to me, for I am holy to thee,&mdash;these
(are) a smoke in My wrath, a fire burning all
the day (or, every day). 6 and 7.&nbsp;Lo, it is
written before Me, I will not rest except I
repay, and I will repay into their bosom your
iniquities and the iniquities of your fathers
together, saith Jehovah, who burned incense
on the mountains, and on the hills blasphemed
Me, and I will measure their first work into
their bosom.</p>

<p>8. Thus saith Jehovah, as (when) juice
is found in the cluster, and one says, Destroy
it not, for a blessing is in it, so will I do for
the sake of My servants, not to destroy the
whole. 9.&nbsp;And I will bring forth from Jacob
a seed, and from Judah an heir of My
mountains, and My chosen ones shall inherit
it, and My servants shall dwell there.
10.&nbsp;And Sharon shall be for (or, become) a
home of flocks, and the valley of Achor a lair
of herds, for My people who have sought Me.</p>

<p>11. And (as for) you, forsakers of Jehovah,
the (men) forgetting My holy mountain, the
(men) setting for Fortune a table, and the
(men) filling for Fate a mingled draught;
<span class="pagenum" id="pA85L">[p.&nbsp;A85L]</span>
12.&nbsp;and I have numbered you to the sword,
and all of you to the slaughter shall bow;
because I called and ye did not answer, I spake
and ye did not hear, and ye did the (thing
that was) evil in my eyes, and that which I
desired not ye chose.</p>

<p>13 and 14. Therefore thus saith the Lord
Jehovah, Lo! My servants shall eat and ye
shall hunger; lo, My servants shall drink
and ye shall thirst; lo, My servants shall
rejoice and ye shall be ashamed; lo, My servants
shall shout from gladness of heart, and
ye shall cry from grief of heart, and from
brokenness of spirit ye shall howl. 15.&nbsp;And
ye shall leave your name for an oath to My
chosen ones, and the Lord Jehovah shall slay
thee, and shall call His servants by another
name (lit. call another name to them),
16.&nbsp;(by) which the (man) blessing himself in the
land (or, earth) shall bless himself by the God
of truth, and (by which) the (man) swearing in
the land (or, earth) shall swear by the God of
truth, because forgotten are the former enmities
(or, troubles), and because they are hidden
from My eyes.</p>

<p>17. For lo I (am) creating (or, about to
create) new heavens and a new earth, and
the former (things) shall not be remembered,
and shall not come up into the mind
(lit. on the heart). 18.&nbsp;But rejoice and be
glad unto eternity (in) that which I (am)
creating, for lo, I (am) creating Jerusalem a
joy, and her people a rejoicing. 19.&nbsp;And I
will rejoice in Jerusalem, and joy in My
people; and there shall not be heard in her
again the voice of weeping and the voice of crying.
20.&nbsp;There shall be no more from there an
infant of days, and an old man who shall not
fulfil his days, for the child a hundred years
old shall die, and the sinner a hundred years
old shall be accursed. 21 and 22.&nbsp;And they
shall build houses and inhabit (them), and
shall plant vineyards and eat the fruit of them,
they shall not build and another inhabit, they
shall not plant and another eat; for as the
days of a tree (shall be) the days of My people,
and the work of their hands My chosen ones
shall wear out (or, survive). 23.&nbsp;They shall
not labour in vain, and they shall not bring
forth for terror; for the seed of the blessed of
Jehovah are they, and their offspring with
them. 24.&nbsp;And it shall be (or, come to pass),
that they shall not yet have called and I will
answer, yet (shall) they (be) speaking and I
will hear. 25.&nbsp;The wolf and the lamb shall
feed as one, and the lion like the ox shall eat
straw, and the serpent dust (for) his food.
They shall not hurt and they shall not corrupt
(or, destroy) in all My holy mountain, saith
Jehovah.</p>

<p>LXVI.&mdash;[This chapter winds up the prophetic
discourse with an express prediction of
<span class="pagenum" id="pA86L">[p.&nbsp;A86L]</span>
the change of dispensation, and a description
of the difference between them. Jehovah will
no longer dwell in temples made with hands,
ver. 1. Every sincere and humble heart shall
be His residence, ver. 2. The ancient sacrifices,
though Divinely instituted, will henceforth
be as hateful as the rites of idolatry,
ver. 3. They who still cling to the abrogated
ritual will be fearfully but righteously requited,
ver. 4. The true Israel cast out by these
deluded sinners shall ere long be glorified,
and the carnal Israel fearfully rewarded, vers.
5, 6. The ancient Zion may already be seen
travailing with a new and glorious dispensation,
vers. 7&ndash;9. They who mourned for her
seeming desolation, now rejoice in her abundance
and her honour, vers. 10&ndash;14. At the
same time the carnal Israel shall be destroyed,
as apostates and idolaters, vers. 15&ndash;17. The
place where they once occupied shall now be
filled by the elect from all nations, ver. 18.
To gather these, a remnant of the ancient
Israel shall go forth among the Gentiles, ver.
19. They shall come from every quarter,
and by every mode of conveyance, ver. 20.
They shall be admitted to the sacerdotal
honours by the chosen people, ver. 21. This
new dispensation shall not be temporary, like
the one before it, but shall last for ever, ver.
22. While the spiritual Israel is thus replenished
from all nations, the apostate Israel
shall perish by a lingering decay in the sight
of an astonished world, ver. 23, 24.]</p>

<p>1. Thus saith Jehovah, the heavens (are)
My throne, and the earth My footstool; where
is (or, what is) the house which ye will build
for Me, and where is (or, what is) the place of
My rest? 2.&nbsp;And all these My own hand
made, and all these were (or, are), saith Jehovah;
and to this one will I look, to the
afflicted and contrite in spirit, and trembling
at My word.</p>

<p>3. Slaying the ox, smiting a man&mdash;sacrificing
the sheep, breaking a dog&rsquo;s neck&mdash;offering
an oblation, blood of swine&mdash;making
a memorial of incense, blessing vanity&mdash;also
they have chosen their ways, and in
their abominations has their soul delighted.
4.&nbsp;I also will choose their vexations, and
their fear I will bring unto them; because I
called and there was no answering, I spake
and they did not hear, and they did evil in
My eyes, and that which I delight not in they
chose.</p>

<p>5. Hear the word of Jehovah, ye that
tremble at His word. Your brethren say,
(these) hating you and casting you out for
My name&rsquo;s sake, Jehovah will be glorified,
and we shall gaze upon our joy&mdash;and they
shall be ashamed. 6.&nbsp;A voice of tumult from
the city! A voice from the temple! The
voice of Jehovah, rendering requital to His
enemies!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="pA87L">[p.&nbsp;A87L]</span>
7. Before she travailed she brought forth,
before her pain came she was delivered of
a male. 8.&nbsp;Who hath heard such a thing?
Who hath seen such things? Shall a land be
brought forth in one day, or shall a nation be
born at once? For Zion hath travailed, she
hath also brought forth her children.
9.&nbsp;Shall I bring to the birth and not cause to
bring forth? saith Jehovah. Or am I the
one causing to bring forth, and shall I shut
up? saith thy God.</p>

<p>10. Rejoice ye with Jerusalem, and exult in
her, all that love her; and be glad with her with
gladness, all those mourning for her.
11.&nbsp;that ye may suck and be satisfied from the
breast of her consolations, that ye may milk
out and enjoy yourselves, from the fulness (or,
the full breast) of her glory. 12.&nbsp;For thus
saith Jehovah, Behold, I am extending to her
peace like a river, and like an overflowing
stream the glory of nations; and ye shall
suck; on the side shall ye be borne, and on
the knees shall ye be dandled. 13.&nbsp;As a man
who his mother comforteth, so will I comfort
you, and in Jerusalem shall ye be comforted.
14.&nbsp;And ye shall see, and your heart
shall leap (with joy), and your bones like
grass shall sprout, and the hand of Jehovah
shall be known to His servants, and He shall
be indignant at His enemies.</p>

<p>15. For lo, Jehovah in fire will come, and
like the whirlwind His chariots, to appease
in fury His anger, and His rebuke in flames
of fire. 16.&nbsp;For by fire is Jehovah striving
and by His sword with all flesh, and multiplied
(or, many) are the slain of Jehovah.
17.&nbsp;The (men) hallowing themselves and
the (men) cleansing themselves to (or, towards)
the gardens after one in the midst,
eaters of swine&rsquo;s flesh and vermin and mouse,
together shall cease (or, come to an end), saith
Jehovah.</p>

<p>18. And I&mdash;their works and their thoughts&mdash;it
is come&mdash;to gather all the nations and
the tongues&mdash;and they shall come and see
My glory. 19.&nbsp;And I will place in them (or,
among them) a sign, and I will send of them
survivors (or, escaped ones) to the nations,
Tarshish, Pul, and Lud, drawers of the bow,
Tubal and Javan, distant isles, which have
not heard my fame, and have not seen My
glory, and they shall declare My glory among
nations. 20.&nbsp;And they shall bring all your
brethren from all nations, an oblation to Jehovah,
with horses, and with chariot, and
with litters, and with mules, and with dromedaries,
on My holy mountain Jerusalem, saith
Jehovah, as the children of Israel bring the
oblation in a clean vessel to the house of
Jehovah. 21.&nbsp;And also of them, will I take for
the priests, for the Levites, saith Jehovah.
<span class="pagenum" id="pA88L">[p.&nbsp;A88L]</span>
22.&nbsp;For as the new heavens and the new earth,
which I am making (or, about to make), are
standing (or, about to stand) before Me, saith
Jehovah, so shall stand your name and your
seed.</p>

<p>23. And it shall be (or, come to pass) that
from new-moon to new-moon (or, on every new-moon),
and from Sabbath to Sabbath (or, on
every Sabbath), shall come all flesh to bow themselves
(or, worship) before Me, saith Jehovah.
24.&nbsp;And they shall go forth and gaze upon
the carcasses of the men who revolted (or, apostatised)
from Me, for their worm shall not die,
and their fire shall not be quenched, and they
shall be a horror to all flesh.</p>

<p>2. Hear, O heavens; and give ear, O earth;
for Jehovah speaketh! I have brought up
children, and raised them high, and they have
fallen away from Me. 3.&nbsp;An ox knoweth its
owner, and an ass its master&rsquo;s crib: Israel
doth not know, my people doth not consider.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="pA2R">[p.&nbsp;A2R]</span>
4. Woe upon the sinful nation, the guilt-laden
people, the miscreant race, the children
acting corruptly! They have forsaken Jehovah,
blasphemed Israel&rsquo;s Holy One, turned away
backwards.</p>

<p>5. Why would ye be perpetually smitten,
multiplying rebellion? Every head is diseased,
and every heart is sick. 6.&nbsp;From the sole of
the foot even to the head there is no soundness
in it: cuts, and stripes, and festering
wounds; they have not been pressed out, nor
bound up, nor has there been any soothing
with oil. 7.&nbsp;Your land&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. a desert; your
cities&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. burned with fire; your field&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
foreigners consuming it before your eyes, and a
desert like overthrowing by strangers. 8.&nbsp;And
the daughter of Zion remains like a hut in a
vineyard; like a hammock in a cucumber field,
as a besieged city. 9.&nbsp;Unless Jehovah of hosts
had left us a little of what had escaped, we had
become like Sodom, we were like Gomorrah.</p>

<p>10. Hear the word of Jehovah, ye Sodom
judges; give ear to the law of our God, O
Gomorrah nation! 11.&nbsp;What is the multitude
of your slain offerings to Me? saith Jehovah.
I am satiated with the whole offerings of rams,
and the fat of stalled calves; and blood of
bullocks and sheep and he-goats I do not like.
12.&nbsp;When ye come to appear before My face,
who hath required this at your hands, to tread
My courts? 13.&nbsp;Continue not to bring lying
meat offering; abomination incense is it to
Me. New-moon and Sabbath, calling of festal
meetings&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I cannot bear ungodliness and
a festal crowd. 14.&nbsp;Your new-moons and
your festive seasons My soul hateth; they
have become a burden to Me; I am weary of
bearing them. 15.&nbsp;And if ye stretch out your
hands, I hide Mine eyes from you; if ye make
ever so much praying, I do not hear: your
hands are full of blood.</p>

<p>16. Wash, clean yourselves; put away the
badness of your doings from the range of My
eyes; cease to do evil; 17.&nbsp;learn to do good,
attend to judgment, set the oppressor right,
do justice to the orphan, conduct the cause of
the widow.</p>

<p>18. O come, and let us reason together,
saith Jehovah. If your sins come forth like
scarlet cloth, they shall become white as snow;
if they are red as crimson, they shall come
forth like wool! 19.&nbsp;If ye then shall willingly
hear, ye shall eat the good of the land; 20.&nbsp;if
ye shall obstinately rebel, ye shall be eaten by
the sword! for the mouth of Jehovah hath
spoken it.</p>

<p>21. How is she become an harlot, the faithful
citadel! she, full of right, lodged in
righteousness, and now&mdash;&mdash;murderers.
22.&nbsp;Thy silver has become dross, thy drink mutilated
with water. 23.&nbsp;Thy rulers are rebellious
and companions of thieves; every one loveth
presents, and hunteth after payment; the
orphan they right not, and the cause of the
widow has no access to them.</p>

<p>24. Therefore, saying of the Lord, of Jehovah
<span class="pagenum" id="pA3R">[p.&nbsp;A3R]</span>
of hosts, of the Strong One of Israel; Ah! I
will relieve Myself on Mine adversaries, and
will avenge Myself upon Mine enemies;
25.&nbsp;and I will bring My hand over thee, and will
smelt out thy dross as with alkali, and will
clear away all thy lead. 26.&nbsp;And I will bring
back thy judges as in the olden time, and thy
counsellors as in the beginning; afterwards
thou wilt be called City of Righteousness, Faithful
Citadel.</p>

<p>27. Zion will be redeemed through judgment,
and her returning ones through righteousness;
28.&nbsp;and breaking up of the rebellious
and sinners together; and those who forsake
Jehovah will perish. 29.&nbsp;For they become
ashamed of the terebinths, in which ye had
your delight; and ye must blush for the
gardens, in which ye took pleasure. 30.&nbsp;For
ye shall become like a terebinth with withered
leaves, and like a garden that hath no water.
31.&nbsp;And the rich man becomes tow, and his
work the spark; and they will both burn
together, and no one extinguishes them.</p>

<p>II.&mdash;1. The word which Isaiah the son of
Amoz saw of Judah and Jerusalem.</p>

<p>2. And it cometh to pass at the end of the
days, the mountain of the house of Jehovah
will be set at the top of the mountains, and
exalted over hills; all nations pour unto
it. 3.&nbsp;And peoples in multitude go and say,
Come, let us go up to the mountain of Jehovah,
to the house of the God of Jacob; let Him
instruct us out of His ways, and we will walk
in His paths: for instruction will go out
from Zion, and the word of Jehovah from
Jerusalem. 4.&nbsp;And He will judge between
the nations, and deliver justice to many
peoples; and they forge their swords into
coulters, and their spears into pruning-hooks.
Nation lifts not up sword against nation,
neither do they exercise themselves in war
any more.</p>

<p>5. O house of Jacob, come, let us walk in
the light of Jehovah.</p>

<p>6. For Thou hast rejected Thy people, the
house of Jacob; for they are filled with things
from the east and are conjurors like the Philistines;
and with the children of foreigners
they go hand in hand. 7.&nbsp;And their land
is filled with silver and gold, and there is no
end in their treasures; and their land is filled
with horses, and there is no end of their chariots.
8.&nbsp;And their land is filled with &mdash;&mdash;
idols; the work of their own hands they worship,
that which their own fingers have made.</p>

<p>9. Thus, then, men are bowed down, and
lords are brought low; and forgive them&mdash;no,
that Thou wilt not. 10.&nbsp;Creep into the
rock, and bury thyself in the dust, before the
terrible look of Jehovah, and before the glory
of His majesty. 11.&nbsp;The people&rsquo;s eyes of
haughtiness are humbled, and the pride of
their lords is bowed down; and Jehovah, He
only, stands exalted in that day.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="pA4R">[p.&nbsp;A4R]</span>
12. For Jehovah of hosts hath a day over
everything towering and lofty, and over everything
exalted; and it becomes low. 13.&nbsp;As
upon all the cedars of Lebanon, the lofty and
exalted, so upon all the oaks of Bashan;
14.&nbsp;as upon all mountains, the lofty ones, so
upon all hills the exalted ones; 15.&nbsp;as upon
every high tower, so upon every fortified
wall; 16.&nbsp;as upon all ships of Tarshish, so
upon all works of curiosity. 17.&nbsp;And the
haughtiness of the people is bowed down, and
the pride of the lords brought low; and
Jehovah, He alone, stands exalted in that
day.</p>

<p>18. And the idols pass utterly away.
19.&nbsp;And they will creep into caves in the rocks,
and cellars in the earth, before the terrible
look of Jehovah, and before the glory of
His majesty, when He ariseth to put the
earth in terror. 20.&nbsp;In that day will a man
cast away his idols of gold; and his idols of
silver, which they made for him to worship,
to the moles and to the bats; 21.&nbsp;to creep
into the cavities of the stone-blocks, and into
the clefts of the rocks, before the terrible
look of Jehovah and before the glory of His
majesty, when He arises to put the earth in
terror.</p>

<p>22. Oh then, let man go, in whose nose is a
breath, for what is he to be estimated at?
III.&mdash;1.&nbsp;For, behold, the Lord, Jehovah of
hosts, takes away from Jerusalem and from
Judah supporter and means of support, every
support of bread and every support of water;
2.&nbsp;hero and man of war, judge and prophet,
and soothsayer and elder; 3.&nbsp;captains of fifty,
and the highly distinguished, and counsellors,
and masters in art, and those skilled in
muttering. 4.&nbsp;And I will give the boys
for princes, and caprices shall rule over them.
5.&nbsp;And the people oppress one another, one
this and another that; the boy breaks out
violently upon the old man, and the despised
upon the honoured. 6.&nbsp;When a man shall
take hold of his brother in his father&rsquo;s house,
Thou hast a coat, thou shalt be our ruler, and
take this ruin under thy hand; 7.&nbsp;he will
cry out in that day, I do not want to be a
surgeon; there is neither bread nor coat in
my house: ye cannot make me the ruler of
the people.</p>

<p>8. For Jerusalem is ruined and Judah
fallen; because their tongue and their
doings are against Jehovah, to defy the eyes
of His glory. 9.&nbsp;The look of their faces
testifies against them, and their sin they
make known like Sodom, without concealing
it: woe to their soul! for they do themselves
harm. 10.&nbsp;Say of the righteous, that it is
well with him; for they will enjoy the fruit
of their doings. 11.&nbsp;Woe to the wicked! it
is ill; for what his hands have wrought will
be done to him. 12.&nbsp;My people, its oppressors
are boys, and women rule over it; my people,
thy leaders are misleaders, who swallow up
the way of thy paths.</p>

<p>13. Jehovah has appeared to plead, and
stands up to judge the nations. 14.&nbsp;Jehovah
<span class="pagenum" id="pA5R">[p.&nbsp;A5R]</span>
will proceed to judgment with the elders of
His people, and its princes. And ye, ye have
eaten of the vineyard; prey of the suffering
is in your houses. 15.&nbsp;What mean ye that ye
crush My people, and grind the face of the
suffering? thus saith the Lord of hosts.</p>

<p>16. Jehovah hath spoken: because the
daughters of Zion are haughty, and walk
about with extended throat, and blinking
with the eyes, walk about with tripping gait,
and tinkle with their foot-ornaments: 17.&nbsp;the
Lord of all makes the crown of the daughters
of Zion scabbed, and Jehovah will uncover
their shame. 18.&nbsp;On that day the Lord will
put away the show of the ankle-clasps, and
of the head-bands, and of the crescents;
19.&nbsp;the ear-rings, and the arm-chains, and the
light veils; 20.&nbsp;the diadems, and the stepping-chains,
and the girdles, and the smelling-bottles,
and the amulets; 21.&nbsp;the finger-rings
and the nose-rings; 22.&nbsp;the gala dresses, and
the sleeve-frocks, and the wrappers, and the
pockets; 23.&nbsp;the hand-mirrors, and the Sindu-cloths,
and the turbans, and the gauze mantles.
24.&nbsp;And instead of balmy scent there will be
mouldiness, and instead of artistic ringlets
a baldness, and instead of the dress-cloak
a frock of sack-cloth, branding instead of
beauty. 25.&nbsp;Thy men fall by the sword, and
thy might in war. 26.&nbsp;Then will her gates
lament and mourn, and desolate is she and
sits down upon the ground. IV.&mdash;1.&nbsp;And
seven women lay hold of one man in that day,
saying, We will eat our own bread, and wear
our own clothes; only let thy name be named
upon us, take away our reproach.</p>

<p>2. In that day will the Sprout of Jehovah
become an ornament and glory, and the fruit
of the land pride and splendour for the redeemed
of Israel. 3.&nbsp;And it will come to
pass, whoever is left in Zion and remains in
Jerusalem, holy will he be called, all who are
written down for life in Jerusalem: 4.&nbsp;when
the Lord shall have washed away the filth of
the daughters of Zion, and shall have purged
away the blood-guiltiness of Jerusalem from
the midst thereof, by the spirit of judgment
and by the spirit of sifting. 5.&nbsp;And Jehovah
creates over every spot of mount Zion, and
over its festal assemblies, a cloud by day, and
smoke, and the shining and flaming fire by
night; for over all the glory comes a canopy;
6.&nbsp;and it will be a booth for shade by day and
covert from storm and from rain.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="tdc"><span class="smcap">judgment of devastation upon the vineyard
of jehovah.&mdash;chap. v.</span></p>

<p class="tdc"><i>Closing Words of the First Cycle of Prophecies.</i></p>

<p>1. Arise, I will sing of my beloved, a song
of my dearest touching His vineyard.</p>

<p>My beloved had a vineyard on a flatly-nourished
mountain-horn, 2.&nbsp;and dug it up and cleared it
of stones, and planted it with noble vines, and
built a tower in it, and also hewed out a winepress
therein; and hoped that it would bring
forth grapes, and it brought forth wild grapes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="pA6R">[p.&nbsp;A6R]</span>
3. And now, O inhabitants of Jerusalem
and men of Judah, judge, I pray you, between
Me and My vineyard! 4.&nbsp;What could have
been done more to My vineyard that I have
not done in it! Wherefore did I hope that
it would bring forth grapes, and it brought
forth wild <span class="wsnw">grapes?<a id="i5_fna1" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#i5_fn1">[1]</a></span></p>

<p>5. Now then, I will tell you what I will do
at once to My vineyard: Take away its hedges,
and it shall be for grazing; pull down its
wall, and it shall be for treading down;
6.&nbsp;and I will put an end to it: it shall not
be pruned nor dragged, and it shall break out
in thorns and thistles, and I will command
the clouds to rain no rain over it. 7.&nbsp;For
the vineyard of Jehovah of hosts is the house
of Israel, and the men of Judah are the plantation
of His delight: He waited for justice,
and behold, grasping; for righteousness, and
behold, a shriek!</p>

<p>8. Woe unto them that join house to house,
who lay field to field, till there is no more
room, and ye alone are dwelling in the midst
of the land. 9.&nbsp;Into mine ears, Jehovah of
hosts: Of a truth many houses shall become
a wilderness, great and beautiful ones deserted.
10.&nbsp;For ten yokes of vineyard will yield one
pailful, and a quarter of seed-corn will produce
a bushel.</p>

<p>11. Woe unto them that rise up early in
the morning to run after strong drink: who
continue till late at night with wine inflaming
them! 12.&nbsp;And guitar and harp, kettle-drum,
and flute, and wine is in their feast;
but they regard not the work of Jehovah, and
see not the purpose of His hands.</p>

<p>13. Therefore My people go into banishment
without knowing; and their glory will
become starving men, and their tumult men
dried up with thirst. 14.&nbsp;Therefore the
under-world opens its jaws wide, and stretches
open its mouth immeasurably wide; and the
glory of Jerusalem descends, and its tumult,
and noise, and those who rejoice within it.
15.&nbsp;Then are mean men bowed down, and
lords humbled, and the eyes of lofty men are
humbled. 16.&nbsp;And Jehovah of hosts shows
Himself exalted in judgment, and God the
Holy One sanctifies Himself in righteousness;
17.&nbsp;and lambs feed as upon their pasture, and
nomad shepherds eat the waste places of the
fat <span class="wsnw">ones.<a id="i5_fna2" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#i5_fn2">[2]</a></span></p>

<p>18. Woe unto them that draw crime with
cords of lying, and sin as with the rope of the
waggon; 19.&nbsp;who say, Let Him hasten, accelerate
His work, that we may see; and let the
<span class="pagenum" id="pA7R">[p.&nbsp;A7R]</span>
counsel of the Holy One of Israel draw near
and come, that we may experience it.</p>

<p>20. Woe to those who call evil good, and
good evil; who give out darkness for light,
and light for darkness; who give out bitter
for sweet, and sweet for bitter.</p>

<p>21. Woe unto them that are wise in their
own eyes, and prudent in their own sight.</p>

<p>22. Woe unto those who are heroes to drink
wine, and brave men to mingle strong drink;
23.&nbsp;who acquit criminals for a bribe, and
take away from every one the righteousness
of the righteous.</p>

<p>24. Therefore, as the tongue of fire devours
stubble, and hay sinks together in the flame,
their root will become like mould, and their
blossom fly up like dust; for they have despised
the law of Jehovah of hosts, and scornfully
rejected the proclamation of the Holy
One of Israel. 25.&nbsp;Therefore is the wrath of
Jehovah kindled against His people, and He
stretches His hand over them, and sites them;
then the hills tremble, and their carcass become
like sweepings in the midst of the streets.</p>

<p>For all this His anger is not appeased, and
His hand is stretched out still, 26.&nbsp;and lifts
up a banner to the distant nations, and hisses
to it from the end of the earth; and, behold,
it comes with haste swiftly. 27.&nbsp;There is
none exhausted, and none stumbling among
them: it gives itself no slumber, and no
sleep; and to none is the girdle of his hips
loosed; and to none is the lace of his shoes
broken; 28.&nbsp;he whose arrows are sharpened,
and all his bows strung; the hoofs of his
horses are counted like flint, and his wheels
like the whirlwind. 29.&nbsp;Roaring issues from
it as from the lioness: it roars like lions, and
utters a low murmur; seizes the prey, carries
it off, and no one rescues. 30.&nbsp;And it utters a
deep roar over it in that day like the roaring
of the sea: and it looks to the earth, and
behold darkness, tribulation, and light; it
becomes night over it in the clouds of
<span class="wsnw">heaven.<a id="i5_fna3" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#i5_fn3">[3]</a></span></p>

<p>1. The year that king Uzziah died, I saw
the Lord of all sitting upon a high and exalted
throne, and His borders filling the
temple. 2.&nbsp;Above it stood the seraphim:
each one had six wings; with two he covered
his face, with two he covered his feet, and
<span class="pagenum" id="pA8R">[p.&nbsp;A8R]</span>
with two he did fly. 3.&nbsp;And one cried to the
other, and said,</p>

<p class="bqpoemr">
Holy, holy, holy! is Jehovah of hosts!<br />
Filling the whole earth is His glory.</p>

<p>4. And the foundation of the threshold
shook with the voice of them that cried; and
the house became full of smoke.</p>

<p>5. Then said I, Woe unto me! for I am lost;
for I am a man of unclean lips, and I am
dwelling among a people of unclean lips: for
mine eyes have seen the King, Jehovah of hosts.</p>

<p>6. And one of the seraphim flew to me
with a red-hot coal in his hand, which he had
taken with the tongs from the altar. 7.&nbsp;And
he touched my mouth with it, and said,
Behold, this hath touched thy lips, and thine
iniquity is taken away; and so thy sin is expiated.</p>

<p>8. Then I heard the voice of the Lord, saying,
Whom shall I send, and who will go for
us? Then I said, Behold me here; send me!</p>

<p>9. He said, Go, and tell this people, Hear
on, and understand not; and look on, but
perceive not. 10.&nbsp;Make ye the heart of this
people greasy, and their ears heavy, and their
eyes sticky; that they may not see with their
eyes, and hear with their ears, and their heart
understand, and they be converted, and one
heal them.</p>

<p>11. Then said I, Lord, how long?</p>

<p>And He answered, Until towns are wasted
without inhabitant, and houses are without
men, and the ground shall be laid waste, a
wilderness, 12.&nbsp;and Jehovah shall put men
far away, and there shall be many forsaken
places within the land. 13.&nbsp;And is there
still a tenth therein, this also is given up to destruction,
like the terebinth and like the oak, of
which, when they are felled, only a root stump
remains: such a root stump is the holy

<p>1. It came to pass, in the days of Ahaz the
son of Jotham, the son of Uzziah, king of
Judah, that Rezin the king of Aram&aelig;a, and
Pekah the son of Remaliah, king of Israel,
went up toward Jerusalem to war against it,
and (he) could not make war upon it.
2.&nbsp;And it was told the house of David, Aram
has settled down upon Ephraim: then his
heart shook, and the heart of the people, as
trees of the wood shake before the wind.</p>

<p>3. Then said Jehovah to Isaiah, Go forth
now to meet Ahaz, thou and Shear-jashub thy
son, to the end of the aqueduct of the upper
pool, to the road of the fuller&rsquo;s field; 4.&nbsp;and
say unto him, Take heed, and keep quiet;
<span class="pagenum" id="pA9R">[p.&nbsp;A9R]</span>
and let not thy heart become soft from these
two smoking firebrand stumps! at the fierce
anger of Rezin, and Aram, and the son of
Remaliah. 5.&nbsp;Because Aram hath determined
evil over thee, Ephraim and the son of Remaliah,
saying, 6.&nbsp;We will march against
Judah, and terrify it, and conquer it for
ourselves, and make the son of Tabeal king
in the midst of it: 7.&nbsp;thus saith the Lord
Jehovah, It will not be brought about, and
will not take place. 8.&nbsp;For head of Aram is
Damascus, and head of Damascus Rezin, and
in five-and-sixty years will Ephraim as a
people be broken to pieces. 9.&nbsp;And head of
Ephraim is Samaria, and head of Samaria the
son of Remaliah; if ye believe not, surely ye
will not remain.</p>

<p>10. And Jehovah continued speaking to
Ahaz as follows: 11.&nbsp;Ask thee a sign of
Jehovah thy God, going deep down into Hades,
or high up to the height above. 12.&nbsp;But
Ahaz replied, I dare not ask, and dare not
tempt Jehovah. 13.&nbsp;And he spake, Hear ye
now, O house of David! Is it too little to
you to weary men, that ye weary my God
also? 14.&nbsp;Therefore the Lord, He will give
you a sign: Behold, the virgin conceives,
and bears a son, and calls his name Immanuel.
15.&nbsp;Butter and honey will he eat, at the time
that he knows to refuse the evil and choose
the good. 16.&nbsp;For before the boy shall
understand to refuse the evil and choose the
good, the land will be desolate, of whose two
kings thou art afraid.</p>

<p>17. Jehovah will bring upon thee, and
upon thy people, and upon thy father&rsquo;s house,
days such as have not come since the day
when Ephraim broke away from Judah&mdash;the
king of Asshur. 18.&nbsp;And it comes to pass in
that day, Jehovah will hiss for the fly which
is at the end of the Nile-arms of Egypt, and
the bees that are in the land of Asshur;
19.&nbsp;and they come and settle all of them in the
valleys of the slopes, and in the clefts of the
rocks, and in all the thorn-hedges, and upon
all grass-plats. 20.&nbsp;In that day will the Lord
shave with a razor, the thing for hire on the
shore of the river, with the king of Assyria,
the head and the hair of the feet: and even
the beard it will take away. 21.&nbsp;And it will
come to pass in that day, that a man will keep
a small cow and a couple of sheep; 22.&nbsp;and it
comes to pass, for the abundance of the milk
they will give he will eat cream: for butter
and honey will every one eat that is left
within the land. 23.&nbsp;And it will come to
pass in that day, every place where a thousand
vines stood at a thousand silverlings will have
become thorns and thistles. 24.&nbsp;With arrows
and with bows will men go, for the whole
land will have become thorns and thistles.
25.&nbsp;And all the hills that were accustomed to
be hoed with the hoe, thou wilt not go to
them for fear of thorns and thistles; and it
has become a gathering-place for oxen, and a
treading-place for sheep.</p>

<p>1. Then Jehovah said to me, Take a large
slab, and write upon it with common strokes,
&ldquo;In speed spoil, booty hastens:&rdquo; 2.&nbsp;and I will take
to me trustworthy witnesses, Uriyah the priest,
and Zehcaryahu the son of Yeberechyahu.</p>

<p>3. And I drew near to the prophetess; and
she conceived, and bare a son: and Jehovah
said to me, Call his name In-speed-spoil-booty-hastens
(Maher-shalal-hash-baz): 4.&nbsp;for before
the boy shall know how to cry, My
father, and my mother, they will carry away
the riches of Damascus, and the spoil of
Samaria, before the king of Asshur.</p>

<p>5. And Jehovah proceeded still further to
speak to me, as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>6. Forasmuch as this people refuseth the
waters of Siloah that go softly, and regardeth
as a delight the alliance with Rezin and the
son of Remalyahu, 7.&nbsp;therefore, behold! the
Lord of all bringeth up upon them the waters
of the river, the mighty and the great, the
king of Assyria, and all his military power:
and he riseth over all his channels, and goeth
over all his banks, 8.&nbsp;and presses forward into
Judah, overflows and pours onward, till it
reaches the neck, and the spreadings out of its
wings fill the breadth of thy land, Immanuel.</p>

<p>9. Exasperate yourselves, O nations, and go
to pieces; and see it, all who are far off in the
earth! Gird yourselves, and go to pieces; gird
yourselves, and go to pieces! 10.&nbsp;Consult counsel,
and it comes to nought; speak the word,
and it is not realised: for with us is God.</p>

<p>11. For Jehovah hath spoken thus to me,
overpowering me with God&rsquo;s hand, and instructing
me not to walk in the way of this people,
saying, 12.&nbsp;Call ye not conspiracy all that this
people calls conspiracy; and what is feared by
it, fear ye not, neither think ye dreadful.
13.&nbsp;Jehovah of hosts, sanctify Him; and let Him
be your fear, and let Him be your terror.
14.&nbsp;So will He become a sanctuary, but a stone
of stumbling and a rock of offence (vexation)
to both the houses of Israel, a snare and a
trap to the inhabitants of Jerusalem.
15.&nbsp;And many among them shall stumble, and
shall fall; and be dashed to pieces, and be
snared and taken.</p>

<p>16. Bind up the testimony, seal the lesson
in my disciples. 17.&nbsp;And I will wait upon
Jehovah, who hides His face before the house
of Jacob, and hope for Him. 18.&nbsp;Behold, I
and the children which God hath given me
for signs and types in Israel, from Jehovah of
hosts, who dwelleth upon mount Zion.
19.&nbsp;And when they shall say to you, Inquire of
the necromancers, and of the soothsayers that
chirp and whisper:&mdash;should not a people
inquire of its God? for the living to the
dead? 20.&nbsp;To the teaching of God, and to
the testimony! If they do not accord with
<span class="pagenum" id="pA11R">[p.&nbsp;A11R]</span>
this word, they are a people for whom no
morning dawns. 21.&nbsp;And it goes about
therein hardly pressed and hungry: and it
comes to pass, when hunger befalls it, it frets
itself, and curses by its king and by its God,
and turns its face upward, 22.&nbsp;and looks to the
earth, and behold distress and darkness, benighting
with anguish, and thrust out into darkness.</p>

<p>IX.&mdash;1. For it does not remain dark where
there is now distress: in the first time He
brought into disgrace the land of Zebulun and
the land of Naphtali, and in the last He brings
to honour the road by the sea, the other side
of Jordan, the circle of the Gentiles.</p>

<p>2. The people that walk about in darkness
see a great light; they who dwelt in the land
of the shadow of death, upon them a light
shines. 3.&nbsp;Thou multipliest the nation,
preparest it great joy; they rejoice before
Thee like the joy in harvest, as men rejoice
when they share the spoil. 4.&nbsp;For the yoke
of its burden and the stick of its neck, the
splinters, as in the day of Midian. 5.&nbsp;For
every boot of those who tramp with boots in
the tumult of battle, and cloak rolled in blood,
shall be for burning, a food of fire. 6.&nbsp;For
unto us a child is born, unto us a son is
given; and the government rests upon His
shoulder: and they call His name Wonder,
Counsellor, Mighty God, Eternal Father,
Prince of Peace. 7.&nbsp;To the increase of
government and to peace without end, upon
the throne of David, and over his kingdom,
to strengthen it, and to support it through
judgment and righteousness from henceforth
even for ever. The jealousy of Jehovah
of hosts will perform this.</p>

<p class="tdc"><i>B.&mdash;Jehovah&rsquo;s Outstretched

<p>8. The Lord sends out a word against Jacob,
and it descends into Israel. 9.&nbsp;And all the
people must make atonement, Ephraim and
the inhabitants of Samaria, saying in pride
and haughtiness of heart, 10.&nbsp;&ldquo;Bricks are
fallen down, and we build with square stones;
sycamores are hewn down, and we put cedars
in their place.&rdquo; 11.&nbsp;Jehovah raises Rezin&rsquo;s
oppressors high above him; and pricks up
his enemies: 12.&nbsp;Aram from the east, and
Philistines from the west; they devour Israel
with full mouth. For all this His anger is not
turned away, and His hand is stretched out
still.</p>

<p>13. But the people turneth not into Him
that smiteth it, and they seek not Jehovah
of hosts. 14.&nbsp;Therefore Jehovah rooteth out
of Israel head and tail, palm-branch and rush,
in one day. 15.&nbsp;Elders and highly distinguished
men, this is the head; and prophets,
lying teachers, this is the tail. 16.&nbsp;The leaders
of this people have become leaders astray, and
their followers swallowed up. 17.&nbsp;Therefore
the Lord will not rejoice in their young men,
and will have no compassion on their orphans
and widows: for all together are profligate
<span class="pagenum" id="pA12R">[p.&nbsp;A12R]</span>
and evil-doers, and every mouth speaketh
blasphemy. With all this His anger is not
turned away, and His hand is stretched out still.</p>

<p>18. For the wickedness burneth up like
fire: it devours thorns and thistles, and burns
in the thickets of the wood; and they smoke
upwards in a lofty volume of smoke.
19.&nbsp;Through the wrath of Jehovah of hosts the
land is turned into coal, and the nation has
become like the food of fire: not one spares
his brother. 20.&nbsp;They hew on the right, and
are hungry; and devour on the left, and are
not satisfied: they devour the flesh of their
own arm: 21.&nbsp;Manasseh, Ephraim; and
Ephraim, Manasseh: these together over
Judah. With all this His anger is not turned
away, and His hand is stretched out still.</p>

<p>X.&mdash;1. Woe unto them that decree unrighteous
decrees, and to the writers who
prepare trouble; 2.&nbsp;to force away the needy
from demanding justice, and to rob the suffering
of my people of their rightful claims, that
widows may become their prey, and they
plunder orphans! 3.&nbsp;And what will ye do
in the day of visitation, and in the storm that
cometh from afar? To whom will ye flee for
help? and where will ye deposit your glory?
4.&nbsp;There is nothing left but to bow down under
prisoners, and they fall under the slain. With
all this His anger is not turned away, but His
hand is stretched out still.</p>

<p>5. Woe to Asshur, the rod of Mine anger,
and it is a staff in their hand, Mine indignation.
6.&nbsp;Against a wicked nation will I send
them, and against the people of My wrath give
them a charge, to spoil spoil, and to make
it trodden down like street-mire.
7.&nbsp;Nevertheless he meaneth not so, neither
does his heart think so; for it is in his
heart to destroy and cut off nations not a few.
8.&nbsp;For he saith, Are not my generals all
kings? 9.&nbsp;Is not Calno as Carchemish, or
Hamath as Arpad, or Samaria as Damascus?
10.&nbsp;As my hand hath reached the kingdoms
of the idols, and their graven images were
more than those of Jerusalem and Samaria;
11.&nbsp;shall I not, as I have done unto Samaria
and her idols, do likewise to Jerusalem and
her idols?</p>

<p>12. And it will come to pass, when the Lord
shall have brought to an end all His work
upon mount Zion and upon Jerusalem, I will
come to punish over the fruit of the pride
of heart of the king of Asshur, and over the
haughty look of his eyes. 13.&nbsp;For he hath
said, By the strength of my hand I have done
it, and by my own wisdom; for I am prudent:
and I removed the bounds of the nations, and
I plundered their stores, and threw down
rulers like a bull. 14.&nbsp;And my hand extracted
the wealth of the nations like a nest:
and as men sweep up forsaken eggs, have I
swept the whole earth; there was none that
<span class="pagenum" id="pA13R">[p.&nbsp;A13R]</span>
moved the wing, and opened the mouth, and
chirped.</p>

<p>15. Dare the axe boast itself against him
that heweth therewith, or the saw magnify
itself against him that useth it? As if a staff
were to swing those that lift it up, as if a stick
should lift up not&mdash;wood! 16.&nbsp;Therefore will
the Lord, the Lord of hosts, send consumption
against his fat men; and under Asshur&rsquo;s
glory there burns a brand like a firebrand.
17.&nbsp;And the light of Israel becomes a fire,
and his Holy One a flame; and it sets on fire
and devours its thistles and thorns in one day.
18.&nbsp;And the glory of his forest and his garden-ground
will He destroy, even to soul and
flesh, so that it is as when a sick man dieth.
19.&nbsp;And the remnant of the trees of his forest
can be numbered, and a boy could write
them.</p>

<p>20. And it will come to pass in that day, the
remnant of Israel, and that which has escaped
of the house of Jacob, will not continue to
stay itself upon its chastiser, and will stay
itself upon Jehovah, the Holy One of Israel,
in truth. 21.&nbsp;The remnant will turn, the
remnant of Jacob, to God the Mighty.
22.&nbsp;For if thy people were even as the sea-sand,
the remnant thereof will turn: destruction is
firmly determined, flowing away righteousness.
23.&nbsp;For the Lord, Jehovah of hosts,
completes the finishing-stroke and that
which is firmly determined, within the whole
land.</p>

<p>24. Therefore thus saith the Lord, Jehovah
of hosts, My people that dwellest on Zion,
be not afraid of Asshur, if it shall smite thee
with the rod, and lift up its stick against thee,
in the manner of Egypt. 25.&nbsp;For yet a very
little while the indignation is past, and
my wrath turns to destroy them: 26.&nbsp;and
Jehovah of hosts moves the whip over it,
as He smite Midian at the rock of Oreb;
and His staff stretches out over the sea.
27.&nbsp;And it will come to pass in that day,
its burden will remove from thy shoulder,
and its yoke from thy neck; and the yoke
will be destroyed from the pressure of the
fat.</p>

<p>28. He comes upon Ayyath, passes through
Migron; in Michmash he leaves his baggage.
29.&nbsp;They go through the pass: let
Geba be our quarters for the night! Ramah
trembles; Gibeah of Saul flees. 30.&nbsp;Scream
aloud, O daughter of Gallim. Only listen,
O Laysha! Poor Anathoth! 31.&nbsp;Madmenah
hurries away; the inhabitants of
Gebim rescue. 32.&nbsp;He still halts in Nob
to-day; swings his hand over the mountain
of the daughter of Zion, the hill of
Jerusalem.</p>

<p>33. Behold, the Lord, Jehovah of hosts, lops
down the branches with terrific force; and those
of towering growth are hewn down, and the
lofty are humbled. 34.&nbsp;And He fells the
thickets of the forest with iron; and Lebanon,
it falls by a Majestic One.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="pA14R">[p.&nbsp;A14R]</span>
XI.&mdash;1. And there cometh forth a twig out of
the stump of Jesse, and a shoot from the roots
bringeth forth fruit. 2.&nbsp;And the Spirit of
Jehovah descends upon Him, spirit of wisdom
and understanding, spirit of counsel and might,
spirit of knowledge and fear of Jehovah;
3.&nbsp;and fear of Jehovah is fragrance to Him; and
He judges not according to outward sight,
neither does He pass sentence according to
outward hearing; 4.&nbsp;and judges the poor with
righteousness, and passes sentence with equity
for the humble in the land; and smites the
earth with the rod of His mouth, and with
the breath of His lips He slays the wicked.
5.&nbsp;And righteousness is the girdle of His
loins, and faithfulness the girdle of His
hips.</p>

<p>6. And the wolf dwells with the lamb,
and the leopard lies down with the kid; and
calf and lion and stalled ox together; a little
boy drives them. 7.&nbsp;And cow and bear go
to the pasture; their young ones lie down
together: and the lion eats chopped straw
like the ox. 8.&nbsp;And the suckling plays by
the hole of the adder, and the weaned child
stretching its hand to the pupil of the basilisk-viper.
9.&nbsp;They will not hurt or destroy in
all my holy mountain: for the land is filled
with knowledge of Jehovah, like the waters
covering the sea.</p>

<p>10. And it will come to pass in that day:
the root-sprout of Jesse, which stands as a
banner of the people&rsquo;s, for it will nations ask,
and its place of rest is glory.</p>

<p>11. And it will come to pass in that day,
the Lord will stretch out His hand a second
time to redeem the remnant of His people
that shall be left, out of Asshur, and out of
Egypt, and out of Pathros, and out of Ethiopia,
and out of Elam, and out of Shinar, and out
of Hamath, and out of the islands of the sea.
12.&nbsp;And He raises a banner for the nations,
and fetches home the outcasts of Israel; and
the dispersed of Judah will He assemble from
the four borders of the earth. 13.&nbsp;And the
jealousy of Ephraim is removed, and the
adversaries of Judah are cut off; Ephraim
will not show jealousy towards Judah, and
Judah will not oppose Ephraim. 14.&nbsp;And
they fly upon the shoulder of the Philistines
seawards; unitedly they plunder the sons of
the East: they seize upon Edom and Moab,
and the sons of Amon are subject to them.
15.&nbsp;And Jehovah pronounces the ban upon
the sea-tongue of Egypt, and swings His
hand over the Euphrates in the glow of His
breath, and smites it into seven brooks, and
makes it so that men go through in shoes.
16.&nbsp;And there will be a road for the remnant
of His people that shall be left, out of Asshur,
as it was for Israel in the day of its departure
out of the land of Egypt.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="pA15R">[p.&nbsp;A15R]</span>

<p>XIII.&mdash;1. Oracle concerning Babel, which
Isaiah the son of Amoz did see.</p>

<p>2. On woodless mountain lift ye up a
banner, call to them with a loud sounding
voice, shake the hand, that they may enter
into the gates of princes! 3.&nbsp;I, I have
summoned My sanctified ones, also called My
heroes to My wrath, My proudly rejoicing
ones. 4.&nbsp;Hark, a rumbling on the mountains
after the manner of a great people! hark, a
rumbling of kingdoms met together! Jehovah
of hosts musters an army, 5.&nbsp;those
that have come out of a distant land, from
the end of heaven: Jehovah and His instruments
of wrath, to destroy the whole earth.
6.&nbsp;Howl; for the day of Jehovah is near;
like a destructive force from the Almighty it
comes. 7.&nbsp;Therefore all arms hang loosely
down, and every human heart melts away.
8.&nbsp;And they are troubled: they fall into
cramps and pangs; like a woman in labour
they twist themselves: one stares at the
other; their faces are faces of flame.
9.&nbsp;Behold, the day of Jehovah cometh, a cruel
one, and wrath and fierce anger, to turn the
earth into a wilderness: and its sinners He
destroys out of it.</p>

<p>10. For the stars of heaven, and its Orions,
will not let their light shine: the sun darkens
itself at its rising, and the moon does not let
its light shine. 11.&nbsp;And I visit the evil upon
the world, and upon sinners their guilt, and
sink into silence the pomp of the proud; and
the boasting of tyrants I throw to the ground.
12.&nbsp;I make men more precious than fine
gold, and people than a jewel of Ophir.
13.&nbsp;Therefore I shake the heavens, and the earth
trembles away from its place, because of the
wrath of Jehovah of hosts, and because of the
day of His fierce anger. 14.&nbsp;And it comes to
pass as a gazelle which is scared, and as
a flock without gatherers: they turn every
one to his people, and they flee every one to
his land. 15.&nbsp;Every one that is found is
<span class="pagenum" id="pA16R">[p.&nbsp;A16R]</span>
pierced through, and every one that is
caught falls by the sword. 16.&nbsp;And their
infants are dashed to pieces before their
eyes, their homes plundered, and their wives
ravished. 17.&nbsp;Behold, I rouse up the Medes
over them, who do not regard silver, and take
no pleasure in gold. 18.&nbsp;And bows dash down
young men; and they have no compassion on
the fruit of the womb: their eye has no pity
on children.</p>

<p>19. And Babel, the ornament of kingdoms,
the proud boast of the Chaldeans, becomes like
Elohim&rsquo;s overthrowing judgments upon Sodom
and Gomorrah. 20.&nbsp;She remains uninhabited
for ever, and unoccupied into generation of
generations; and not an Arab pitches his tent
there, and shepherds do not make their folds
there. 21.&nbsp;And there lie beasts of the desert,
and horn-owls fill their houses; and ostriches
dwell there, and field-devils hop about there.
22.&nbsp;And jackals howl in her castles, and wild
dogs in palaces of pleasure; and her time is
near to come, and her days will not be prolonged.</p>

<p>XIV.&mdash;1. For Jehovah will have mercy on
Jacob, and will once more choose Israel, and
will settle them down in their own land: and
the foreigner will associate with them, and
they will cleave to the house of Jacob.
2.&nbsp;And nations take them, and accompany them
to their place; and the house of Israel takes
them to itself in the land of Jehovah for
servants and maid-servants: and they hold in
captivity those who led them away captive;
and become lords over their oppressors.
3.&nbsp;And it cometh to pass, on the day that
Jehovah giveth thee the rest from thy plague,
and from thy cares, and from the heavy
bondage wherein thou wast made to serve,
4.&nbsp;that thou shalt raise such a song of triumph
concerning the king of Babel and say&mdash;</p>

<p>How hath the oppressor ceased! the place
of torture ceased! 5.&nbsp;Jehovah hath broken
the rod of the wicked, the ruler&rsquo;s staff,
6.&nbsp;which smote nations in wrath with strokes
without ceasing, subjugated nations wrathfully
with hunting that never stays. 7.&nbsp;The
whole earth rests, is quiet: they break forth
into singing. 8.&nbsp;Even the cypresses rejoice
at thee, the cedars of Lebanon: &ldquo;Since thou
hast gone to sleep, no one will come up to lay
axe upon us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>9. The kingdom of the dead below is all in
uproar on account of thee, to meet thy coming;
it stirs up the shades for thee, all the he-goats
of the earth; it raiseth up from their throne-seats
all the kings of the nations. 10.&nbsp;They
all rise up and say to thee, Art thou also
made weak like us? Art thou become like us?
11.&nbsp;Thy pomp is cast down to the region of
the dead, the noise of the harps: maggots are
spread under thee, and they that cover thee
are worms. 12.&nbsp;How art thou fallen from the
sky, thou star of light, son of the dawn, hurled
down to the earth, thou that didst throw
down nations from above! 13.&nbsp;And thou,
thou hast said in thine heart, I will ascend
<span class="pagenum" id="pA17R">[p.&nbsp;A17R]</span>
unto heaven, I will exalt my throne above the
stars of God, and sit down on the mount of
the assembly of gods in the corner of the
earth; 14.&nbsp;I will ascend to the heights of the
clouds, I will make myself like the Most High.
15.&nbsp;Nevertheless, thou wilt be cast down into
the region of the dead, into the corner of the
pit. 16.&nbsp;They that see thee look, considering
thee, look at thee thoughtfully: &ldquo;Is this the
man that set the earth trembling, and kingdoms
shaking, 17.&nbsp;that made the world a wilderness,
and destroyed its cities, and did not
release its prisoners (to their) home?&rdquo;</p>

<p>18. All the kings of the nations, they are
all interred in honour, every one in his house:
19.&nbsp;but thou art cast away far from thy
sepulchre like a shoot hurled away, clothed
with slain, with those pierced through with the
sword, those that go down to the stones of the
pit; like a carcass trodden under feet.
20.&nbsp;Thou art not united with them in burial, for thou
hast destroyed thy land, murdered thy people.</p>

<p>The seed of evil-doers will not be named
for ever. 21.&nbsp;Prepare a slaughter-house for
his sons, because of the iniquity of their
fathers! They shall not rise and conquer
lands, and fill the face of the earth with cities.</p>

<p>22. And I will rise up against them, saith
Jehovah of hosts, and root out in Babel name
and remnant, sprout and shoot, saith Jehovah.
23.&nbsp;And I will make it the possession of hedgehogs
and marshes of water, and sweep it away
with the besom of destruction, saith Jehovah
of hosts.</p>

<p>24. Jehovah of hosts hath sworn, saying,
Surely as I have thought, so shall it come to
pass; and as I have purposed, that takes place;
25.&nbsp;to break Asshur in pieces in My land, and
upon My mountain will I tread him under
foot; then his yoke departs from them, and
his burden will depart from their neck.
26.&nbsp;This is the purpose that is purposed over the
whole earth; and this is the hand that is
stretched out over all nations. 27.&nbsp;For Jehovah
of hosts hath purposed, and who could
bring it to nought? and His hand that is
stretched out, who can turn it back?</p>

30.&nbsp;And the poorest of the poor will feed, and
needy ones lie down in peace; and I kill thy
root through hunger, and he slays thy remnant.</p>

<p>31 Howl, O gate! cry, O city! O Philistia,
thou must melt entirely away; for from the

Jehovah hath founded Zion, and that the
afflicted of His people are hidden therein.</p>

<span class="smcap">the oracle concerning moab.&mdash;chaps. xv., xvi.</span></p>

<p>XV.&mdash;1. Oracle concerning Moab! for in a
night Ar-Moab is laid waste, destroyed; for
in a night Kir-Moab is laid waste, destroyed.
2.&nbsp;They go up to the temple-house and Dibon,
up to the heights to weep: upon Nebo and
upon Medebah of Moab there is weeping: on
all heads baldness, every beard is mutilated.
3.&nbsp;In the markets of Moab they gird themselves
with sackcloth; on the roofs of the
land, and in the streets, everything wails,
melting into tears. 4.&nbsp;Heshbon cries, and &rsquo;El&acirc;le;
even to Jahaz they hear their howling; even
the armed men of Moab break out into mourning
thereat; its soul trembles within it.
5.&nbsp;My heart, towards Moab it crieth out; its
bolts reach to Zoar, the three-year-old heifer.
For the mountain-slope of Luhith they ascend
with weeping; for on the road to Horonaijim
they lift up a cry of despair. 6.&nbsp;For the
waters of Nimrim are waste places from this
time forth: for the grass is dried up, the
vegetation wasteth away, the green is gone.
7.&nbsp;Therefore what has been spared, what has
been gained, and their provision, they carry it
over the willow-brook. 8.&nbsp;For the scream
has gone round in the territory of Moab; the
wailing of Moab resounds to Eglayim, and his
wailing to Be&#275;r-Elim. 9.&nbsp;For the waters of
Dimon are full of blood; for I suspend over
Dimon a new calamity, over the escaped of
Moab a lion, and over the remnant of the land.</p>

<p>XVI.&mdash;1. Send a land-ruler&rsquo;s tribute of lambs
from Sela desert-wards to the mountain of the
daughter of Zion. 2.&nbsp;And the daughters of
Moab will be like birds fluttering about, a
scared nest, at the fords of Arnon. 3.&nbsp;Give
counsel, for a decision, make thy shadow
like night in the midst of noon: hide the
outcasts, do not betray the wanderers.
4.&nbsp;Let mine outcasts tarry in thee, Moab; be a
covert to it from before the spoiler. For the
extortioner is at an end, desolation has disappeared,
treaders down are away from the
land. 5.&nbsp;And a throne is established by grace,
and there sits thereon in truth in the tent of
David one judging, and zealous for right, and
practised in righteousness.</p>

<p>6. We have heard of the pride of Moab, the
very haughty (pride), the haughtiness, and
his pride, and his wrath, the falsehood of his
speech. 7.&nbsp;Therefore will Moab wail for
Moab, everything will wail: for the grape-cakes
of Kir-Haraseth will ye whine, utterly
crushed. 8.&nbsp;For the fruit-fields of Heshbon
have faded away: the vine of Simmah, lords
of the nations its branches smote down: they
reached to Ja&rsquo;zer, trailed through the desert:
its branches spread themselves out wide,
crossed over the sea. 9.&nbsp;Therefore I bemoan
the vine of Sibmah with the weeping of
Jazer; I flood thee with my tears, O Heshbon
and Elealeh, that H&ecirc;dad hath fallen upon thy
fruit-harvest and upon thy vintage. 10.&nbsp;And
joy is taken away, and the rejoicing of the
<span class="pagenum" id="pA19R">[p.&nbsp;A19R]</span>
garden-land; and there is no exulting, no
shouting in the vineyards: the treader treads
out no wine in the presses; I put an end to
the H&ecirc;dad. 11.&nbsp;Therefore my bowels sound
for Moab like a harp, and my inside for Kir-Heres.
12.&nbsp;And it will come to pass, when it
is seen that Moab is weary with weeping upon
the mountain height, and enters into its sanctuary
to pray, it will not gain anything.</p>

<p>13. This is the word which Jehovah spake
long ago concerning Moab. And now Jehovah
speaketh thus: In three years, like the years
of a hireling, the glory of Moab is disgraced,
together with all the multitude of the great:
a remnant is left, contemptibly small, and not
great at all.</p>

<p class="tdc"><span class="smcap">the oracle concerning damascus and israel.&mdash;chap. xvii.</span></p>

<p>1. The burden of Damascus.</p>

<p>Behold, Damascus must (be taken) away
out of the number of the cities, and will be a
heap of fallen ruins. 2.&nbsp;The cities of Aroer
are forsaken, they are given up to flocks, they
lie there without any one scaring them away.
3.&nbsp;And when the fortress of Ephraim is abolished,
and the kingdom of Damascus; and it happens
to those that are left of Aram as to the
glory of the sons of Israel, saith Jehovah of
hosts.</p>

<p>4. And it comes to pass in that day, the
glory of Jacob wastes away, and the fat of his
flesh grows thin. 5.&nbsp;And it will be as when
a reaper grasps the stalks of wheat, and his
arm mows off the ears; and it will be as with
one who gathers ears in the valley of Rephaim.
6.&nbsp;Yet a gleaning remains from it, as at the
olive-beating: two, three berries high up at
the top; four, five in its, the fruit-tree&rsquo;s
branches, saith Jehovah the God of Israel.
7.&nbsp;At that day will man look up to his Creator,
and his eyes will look to the Holy One of
Israel. 8.&nbsp;And he will not look to the altars,
the work of his hands; and what his fingers
have made he will not regard, neither the
Astartes nor the sun-gods.</p>

<p>9. In that day will his fortified cities be
like the ruins of the forest and of the mountain
top, which they cleared before the sons
of Israel: and there arises a waste place.
10.&nbsp;For thou hast forgotten the God of thy salvation,
and hast not thought of the Rock of thy
stronghold, therefore thou plantest charming
plantations, and didst set them with strange
vines. 11.&nbsp;In the day that thou plantedst,
thou didst make a fence; and with the morning
dawn thou madest thy sowing to blossom:
a harvest heap in the day of deep wounds and
deadly sorrow of heart.</p>

<p>12. Woe to the roaring of many nations:
like the roaring of seas they roar; and low the
rumbling of nations, like the rumbling of
mighty waters they rumble! 13.&nbsp;Nations,
like the rumbling of mighty waters they
rumble; and He threatens it: then it flies
<span class="pagenum" id="pA20R">[p.&nbsp;A20R]</span>
far away, and is chased like the chaff of the
mountains before the wind, and like a cloud
of dust before the gale. 14.&nbsp;At eventide, behold
consternation; and before the morning
dawn it is destroyed! this is the portion of
our plunderers, and the lot of our robbers.</p>

<p class="tdc"><span class="smcap">ethiopia&rsquo;s submission to jehovah.&mdash;chap. xviii.</span></p>

<p>1. Woe to the land of the whirring of wings,
which is beyond the rivers of Cush; 2.&nbsp;that
sends ambassadors into the sea, and in boats
of papyrus over the face of the waters. Go,
swift messengers, to the people stretched out
and polished, to the terrible people far away
on the other side, to the nation of command
upon command and treading down, whose
land rivers cut through. 3.&nbsp;All ye possessors
of the globe and inhabitants of the earth,
when a banner rises on the mountains, look ye:
and when they blow the trumpets, hearken!
4.&nbsp;For thus hath Jehovah spoken to me: I
will be still, and I will observe upon My
throne during clear weather in sunshine,
during a cloud of dew in the heat of harvest.
5.&nbsp;For before the harvest, when the blossom
falls off, and the fruit becomes the ripening
grape: then will He cut off the branches with
pruning-hooks; and the tendrils He removes,
breaks off. 6.&nbsp;They are left altogether to the
birds of prey on the mountains, and to the
cattle of the land; and the birds of prey
summer thereon, and all the cattle of the
land will winter thereon.</p>

<p>7. At that time will there be offered as a
homage to Jehovah of hosts a nation stretched
out and polished, and from a terrible people,
far away on the other side; a nation of command
upon command and treading down,
whose land rivers cut through, at the place of
the name of Jehovah of hosts, the mountain
of Zion.</p>

<p class="tdc"><span class="smcap">the oracle concerning egypt.&mdash;chap. xix.</span></p>

<p>1. Behold, Jehovah rideth upon a light
cloud, and cometh to Egypt; and the idols
of Egypt shake before Him, and the heart
of Egypt melteth within it. 2.&nbsp;And I spur
Egypt against Egypt: and they go to war,
every one with his brother, and every one
with his neighbour; city against city, kingdom
against kingdom. 3.&nbsp;And the spirit of Egypt
is emptied out within it: and I swallow up its
ready counsel; and they go to the idols to
inquire, and to the mutterers, and to the
oracle-spirits, and to the soothsayers. 4.&nbsp;And
I shut up Egypt in the head of a hard rule;
and a fierce king will rule over them, saith
the Lord, Jehovah of hosts.</p>

<p>5. And the waters will dry up from the sea,
and the river is parched and dried. 6.&nbsp;And
the arms of the river spread a stench; the
channels of Matzor become shallow and
parched: reed and rush shrivel up. 7.&nbsp;The
meadow by the Nile, on the border of the
Nile, and every cornfield of the Nile, dries
<span class="pagenum" id="pA21R">[p.&nbsp;A21R]</span>
up, is scattered, and disappears. 8.&nbsp;And the
fishermen groan, and all who throw draw-nets
into the Nile lament, and they that spread
out the net upon the face of the waters
languish away. 9.&nbsp;And the workers of fine
combed flax are confounded, and the weavers
of cotton fabrics. 10.&nbsp;And the pillars of the
land are ground to powder; all that work for
wages are troubled in mind.</p>

<p>11. The princes of Zoan become mere fools,
the wise counsellors of Pharaoh; readiness in
counsel is stupefied. How can ye say to
Pharaoh, I am a son of wise men, a son of
kings of the olden time? 12.&nbsp;Where are they
then, thy wise men? Let them announce
to thee, and know what Jehovah of hosts
hath determined concerning Egypt. 13.&nbsp;The
princes of Zoan have become fools, the princes
of Memphis are deceived; and they have led
Egypt astray who are the corner-stone of its
castes. 14.&nbsp;Jehovah hath poured a spirit of
giddiness into the heart of Egypt, so that
they have led Egypt astray in all its doing, as
a drunken man wandereth about in his vomit.
15.&nbsp;And there does not occur of Egypt any
work which worked, of head and tail, palm-branch
and rush.</p>

<p>16. In that day will the Egyptians become
like women, and tremble and be alarmed at
the swinging of the hand of Jehovah of hosts,
which He sets in motion against it. 17.&nbsp;And
the land of Judah becomes a shuddering for
Egypt; as often as they mention this against
Egypt, it is alarmed, because of the decree of
Jehovah of hosts, that He suspendeth over it.</p>

<p>18. In that day there will be five cities in
the land of Egypt speaking the language of
Canaan, and swearing to Jehovah of hosts:
&rsquo;Ir ha-Heres will one be called. 19.&nbsp;In that
day there stands an altar consecrated to Jehovah
in the midst of the land of Egypt, and an
obelisk near the border of the land consecrated
to Jehovah. 20.&nbsp;And a sign and a witness
for Jehovah of hosts is this in the land of
Egypt; when they cry to Jehovah for oppressors,
He will send them a helper and champion,
and deliver them. 21.&nbsp;And Jehovah
makes Himself known to the Egyptians, and
the Egyptians know Jehovah in that day; and
they serve Him with slain-offerings and meat-offerings,
and vow vows to Jehovah, and pay
them. 22.&nbsp;And Jehovah smites Egypt, smiting
and healing; and if they return to Jehovah,
He suffers Himself to be entreated, and heals
them. 23.&nbsp;In that day a road will run from
Egypt to Asshur, and Asshur comes into
Egypt, and Egypt to Asshur; and Egypt
worships (Jehovah) with Asshur. 24.&nbsp;In that
day will Israel be a third part to Egypt and
Asshur, a blessing in the midst of the earth,
25.&nbsp;since Jehovah of hosts blesseth them thus:
Blessed be thou, My people Egypt; and thou,
Asshur, the work of My hands; and thou
Israel, Mine inheritance.</p>

<span class="smcap">symbol of the fall of egypt and ethiopia,

<p>1. In the year that Tartan came to Ashdod,
Sargon the king of Asshur having sent him (and
he made war against Ashdod, and captured it):
2.&nbsp;at that time Jehovah spake through Yesha&rsquo;-yahu,
the son of Amoz, as follows, Go and
loosen the smock-front from off thy loins, and
take off thy shoes from thy feet. And he did
so, and went stripped and barefooted.</p>

<p>3. And Jehovah said, As my servant Yesha&rsquo;-yahu
goeth naked and barefooted, a sign and
a type for three years long over Egypt and
over Ethiopia, 4.&nbsp;so will the king of Asshur
carry away the prisoners of Egypt and the
exiles of Ethiopia, children and old men,
naked and barefooted, and with their seat
uncovered&mdash;a shame to Egypt.</p>

<p>5. And they cry together, and behold themselves
deceived by Ethiopia, to which they
looked and by Egypt, in which they gloried.
6.&nbsp;And the inhabitant of this coast-land saith
in that day, Behold, thus it happens to those
to whom we looked, whither we fled for help
to deliver us from the king of Asshur: and
how should we, we escape?</p>

sea (babylon).&mdash;chap. xxi.&nbsp;1&ndash;10.</span></p>

<p>1. As storms in the south approach, it
comes from the desert, from a terrible land.
2.&nbsp;Hard vision is made known to me: the
spoiler spoils, and the devastator devastates.
Go up, Elam! Surround, Moday! I put an
end to all their sighing. 3.&nbsp;Therefore are my
loins full of cramp: pangs have taken hold of
me, as the pangs of a travailing woman: I
twist myself, so that I do not hear; I am
brought down with fear, so that I do not see.
4.&nbsp;My heart beats wildly; horror hath troubled
me; the darkness of night that I love, He
hath turned for me into quaking.</p>

<p>5. They cover the table, watch the watch,
eat, drink. Rise up, ye princes! Anoint the
shield! 6.&nbsp;For thus saith the Lord to me,
Go, set a spy; what he seeth, let him declare.
7.&nbsp;And he saw a procession of cavalry, pairs
of horsemen, a procession of asses, a procession
of camels; and listened sharply, as sharply as
he could listen. 8.&nbsp;Then he cried with a lion&rsquo;s
voice, Upon the watch-tower, O Lord, I stand
continually by day, and upon my watch I keep
my stand all the nights. 9.&nbsp;And, behold,
there came a cavalcade of men, pairs of horsemen,
and lifted up its voice, and said, Fallen,
fallen is Babylon; and all the images of its
gods He hath dashed to the ground! 10.&nbsp;O

14.&nbsp;Bring water to meet thirsty ones! The inhabitants
of the land of Tema are coming with its

flying before swords, before drawn swords, and
before a bent bow, and before oppressive war.</p>

<p>16. For thus hath the Lord spoken to me,
Within a year, as the years of a hired labourer,
it is over with all the glory of Kedar.

full of tumult, thou noisy city, shouting castle,
thy slain men are not slain with the sword,
nor slaughtered in battle. 3.&nbsp;All thy rulers
departing together are fettered without bow;
all thy captured ones are fettered together,
fleeing far away.</p>

<p>4. Therefore I say, Look away from me,
that I may weep bitterly; press me not
with consolations for the destruction of the
daughter of my people! 5.&nbsp;For a day of
noise, and of treading down, and of confusion,
cometh from the Lord, Jehovah of hosts, in
the valley of vision, breaking down walls; and
a cry of woe echoes against the mountains.</p>

<p>6. And Elam has taken the quiver, together
with chariots with men, horsemen; and Kir
has drawn out the shield. 7.&nbsp;And then it
comes to pass, that thy choicest valleys are
filled with chariots, and the horsemen plant a
firm foot towards the gate.</p>

<p>8. Then he takes away the covering of
Judah, and thou lookest in that day to the
store of arms of the forest-house; 9.&nbsp;and ye
see the breaches of the city of David, that
there are many of them; and ye collect together
the waters of the lower pool. 10.&nbsp;And
ye number the houses of Jerusalem, and pull
down the houses, to fortify the wall. 11.&nbsp;And
ye make a basin between the two walls for
the waters of the old pool; and ye do not
look to Him who made it, neither do ye have
regard to Him who fashioned it long ago.</p>

that day to weeping, and to mourning, and
to the pulling out of hair, and to girding with
sackcloth; 13.&nbsp;and behold joy and gladness,
slaughtering of oxen and killing of sheep,
eating of flesh and drinking of wine, eating
and drinking, for &lsquo;to-morrow we die.&rsquo;

there shalt thou die, and thither the chariots

and when he shuts, no man opens. 23.&nbsp;And
I fasten him as a plug in a fast place, and he
becomes the seat of honour to his father&rsquo;s
house. 24.&nbsp;And the whole mass of his father&rsquo;s
house hangs upon him, the offshoots and the

<p>1. Howl, ye ships of Tarshish; for it is laid
waste, so that there is no house, no entrance

it is made known to them. 2.&nbsp;Be alarmed,
ye inhabitants of the coast! Sidonian merchants,
sailing over the sea, filled thee once.
3.&nbsp;And the sowing of Sichor came upon great

she became gain for nations. 4.&nbsp;Shudder, O

the sea, thus: I have not travailed, nor given
birth, nor trained up young men, brought up
maidens. 5.&nbsp;When the report cometh to
Egypt, they tremble at the report from Tzor.</p>

the days of the olden time, whom her feet
carried far away to settle? 8.&nbsp;Who hath determined
such a thing concerning Tzor, the
distributor of crowns, whose merchants are
princes, whose traders are the chief men of

<span class="pagenum" id="pA25R">[p.&nbsp;A25R]</span>
it, to desecrate the pomp of every kind
of ornament, to dishonour the chief men of
the earth, all of them.</p>

<p>10. Overflow thy land like the Nile, O
daughter of Tarshish! No girdle restrains
thee any longer. 11.&nbsp;His hand hath He
stretched over the sea, thrown the kingdoms into
trembling; Jehovah hath given commandment
concerning Kena&rsquo;an to destroy her fortresses.
12.&nbsp;And He said, Thou shalt not
rejoice any further, thou disgraced one, virgin
daughter of Sidon. Go up to Kittim, go over;
there also shalt thou not find rest. 13.&nbsp;Behold
the Chaldean land: this people that has not
been (Asshur&mdash;it hath prepared the same for
desert beasts)&mdash;they set up their siege-towers,
destroy the palaces of Kena&rsquo;an, make it a

sweep through the city, O forgotten harlot!
Play bravely, sing zealously, that thou mayest

pass at the end of the seventy years: Jehovah
will visit Tzor, and she comes again to her
hire, and commits prostitution with all the
kingdoms of the earth on the broad surface
of the globe. 18.&nbsp;And her gain and her reward
of prostitution will be holy to Jehovah:
it is not stored up nor gathered together; but
her gain from commerce will be theirs who

<p>1. Behold, Jehovah emptieth the earth, and
layeth it waste, and marreth its form, and
scattereth all its inhabitants. 2.&nbsp;And it happeneth,
as to the people, so to the priest; as
to the servant, so to his master; as to the
maid, so to her mistress; as to the buyer, so
to the seller; as to the lender, so to the borrower;
as to the creditor, so to the debtor.
3.&nbsp;Emptying the earth is emptied, and plundering
is plundered: for Jehovah hath spoken
this word.</p>

<p>4. Smitten down, withered up is the earth;
pined away, wasted is the world; pined away
have they, the foremost of the people of the
earth. 5.&nbsp;And the earth has become wicked
among its inhabitants; for they transgressed
revelations, set at naught the ordinance, broke
the everlasting covenant. 6.&nbsp;Therefore hath
the curse devoured the earth, and they who
dwelt in it make expiation: therefore are the
inhabitants of the earth withered up, and
there are very few mortals left. 7.&nbsp;New wine
mourneth, vine is parched, all the merry-hearted

meth tastes bitter to them that drink it.</p>

every house is shut up, so that no man can
come in. 11.&nbsp;There is lamentation for wine
in the fields; all rejoicing has set; the delight
of the earth is banished. 12.&nbsp;What is left
of the city is wilderness, and the gate was
shattered to ruins. 13.&nbsp;For so will it be
within the earth, in the midst of the nations;
as at the olive-beating, as at the gleaning,
when the vintage is over.</p>

<p>14. They lift up the voice, and exult; for
the majesty of Jehovah they shout from the
sea! 15.&nbsp;Therefore praise ye Jehovah in the
lands of the sun, in the islands of the sea the
name of Jehovah the God of Israel. 16.&nbsp;From
the border of the earth we hear songs: Praise
to the Righteous One.</p>

<p>Then I said, Ruin to me! ruin to me!
Robbers rob, and robbing, they rob as robbers!
17.&nbsp;Horror, and pit, and snare are over thee,
O inhabitant of the earth! 18.&nbsp;And it cometh
to pass, whoever fleeth from the tidings
of horror falleth into the pit; and whoever
escapeth out of the pit is caught in the snare:
for the trap-doors on high are opened, and the
firm foundations of the earth shake. 19.&nbsp;The
earth rending, is rent asunder; the earth
bursting, is burst in pieces; the earth shaking,
tottereth. 20.&nbsp;The earth reeling, reeleth like
a drunken man, and swingeth like a hammock;
and its burden of sin presseth upon
it; and it falleth, and riseth not again.</p>

<p>21. And it cometh to pass in that day, Jehovah
will visit the army of the high place in
the high place, and the kings of the earth on
the earth. 22.&nbsp;And they are imprisoned, as
one imprisons captives in the pit, and shut up
in prison; and in the course of many days
they are visited. 23.&nbsp;And the moon blushes,
and the sun turns pale; for Jehovah of hosts
reigns royally upon mount Zion and in Jerusalem,
and before His elders in glory.</p>

<p>1. Jehovah, Thou art my God; I will exalt
Thee, I will praise Thy name, that Thou hast
wrought wonders, counsels from afar, sincerity,
truth. 2.&nbsp;For Thou hast turned it from a
city into a heap of stones, the steep castle into
a ruin; the palace of the barbarians from
being a city, to be rebuilt no more for ever.
3.&nbsp;Therefore a wild people will honour Thee,
cities of violent nations fear Thee. 4.&nbsp;For
<span class="pagenum" id="pA27R">[p.&nbsp;A27R]</span>
Thou provest Thyself a stronghold to the
lowly, a stronghold to the poor in his distress,
as a shelter from the storm of rain, as a
shadow from the burning of the sun; for the
blast of the terrible once was as a storm against
a wall. 5.&nbsp;Like the burning of the sun in a
parched land, Thou subduest the noise of the
barbarians; (like) the burning of the sun
through the shadow of a cloud, the triumphal
song of the violent ones was brought low.</p>

<p>6. And Jehovah of hosts prepares for all
nations upon this mountain a feast of fat
things, a feast of wines on the lees, of fat
things rich in marrow, of wines on the lees
thoroughly strained. 7.&nbsp;And He casts away
upon this mountain the veil that veiled over
all peoples, and the covering that covered
over all nations. 8.&nbsp;He puts away death for
ever; and the Lord Jehovah wipes the tear
from every face; and He removes the shame
of His people from the whole earth: for Jehovah
hath spoken it.</p>

Jehovah, for whom we waited; let us be glad
and rejoice in His salvation. 10.&nbsp;For the
hand of Jehovah will sink down upon this

where it is, as straw is trodden down in the
water of the dung-pit. 11.&nbsp;And he spreadeth
out his hands in the pool therein, as the
swimmer spreadeth them out to swim; but
Jehovah forceth down the pride of Moab in
spite of the artifices of his hands. 12.&nbsp;Yes,
thy steep, towering walls He bows down, forces
under, and casts earthwards into dust.</p>

<p class="tdc"><i>C.&mdash;Third Echo: Israel Brought Back,

<p>1. In that day will this song be sung in the
land of Judah: A city of defence is ours;
salvation He sets for walls and bulwarks.
2.&nbsp;Open ye the gates, that a righteous people
may enter, one keeping truthfulness. 3.&nbsp;Thou
keepest the firmly-established mind in peace,
peace; for his confidence rests on Thee.
4.&nbsp;Hang confidently on Jehovah for ever: for in
Jah, Jehovah, is an everlasting rock. 5.&nbsp;For
He hath bent down them that dwell on high;
the towering castle, He tore it down, tore it
down to the earth, cast it into dust. 6.&nbsp;The
foot treads it to pieces, feet of the poor, steps
of the lowly. 7.&nbsp;The path that the righteous
takes is smoothness; Thou makest the course
of the righteous smooth.</p>

<p>8. We also have waited for Thee, that Thou
shouldest come in the path of Thy judgments;
the desire of the soul went after Thy name,
and after Thy remembrance. 9.&nbsp;With my
soul I desired Thee in the night; yea, with
<span class="pagenum" id="pA28R">[p.&nbsp;A28R]</span>
my spirit deep within me, I longed to have
Thee here: for when Thy judgments strike
the earth, the inhabitants of the earth learn
righteousness.</p>

<p>10. If favour is shown to the wicked man,
he does not learn righteousness; in the most
upright land he acts wickedly; and has no eye
for the majesty of Jehovah. 11.&nbsp;Jehovah,
Thy hand has been exalted, but they did not
see: they will see the zeal for a people, being
put to shame; yea, fire will devour Thine
adversaries. 12.&nbsp;Jehovah, Thou wilt ordain
peace for us; for Thou hast accomplished all
our work for us. 13.&nbsp;Jehovah our God, lords
besides Thee had enslaved us; but through
Thee we praise Thy name. 14.&nbsp;Dead men
live not again, shades do not rise again; so
hast Thou visited and destroyed them, and
caused all their memory to perish. 15.&nbsp;Thou
hast added to the nation, O Jehovah, hast
added to the nation; glorified Thyself; moved
out all the borders of the land.</p>

<p>16. Jehovah, in trouble they missed Thee,
poured out light supplication when Thy chastisement
came upon them. 17.&nbsp;As a woman
with child, who draws near to her delivery,
writhes and cries out in her pangs, so were
we in Thy sight, O Jehovah. 18.&nbsp;We went
with child, we writhed; it was as if we brought
forth wind. We brought no deliverance to
the land, and the inhabitants of the world did
not come to the light.</p>

<p>19. Thy dead will live, my corpses rise
again. Awake and rejoice, ye that lie in the
dust! For Thy dew is as the dew of the lights,
and the earth will bring shades to the day.</p>

<p>20. Go in, my people, into thy chambers,
and shut the door behind thee; hide thyself
a little moment, till the judgment of wrath
passes by. 21.&nbsp;For, behold, Jehovah goeth
out of His place to visit the iniquity of the
earth upon them; and the earth discloses the
blood that it has sucked up, and no more
covers her slain.</p>

the smiter, or is it slain like the slaying of
those slain by Him? 8.&nbsp;Thou punishedst it
with measures, when Thou didst thrust it
away, sifting with violent breath in the day
of the east wind. 9.&nbsp;Therefore will the guilt
of Jacob be purged thus; and this is all the
fruit of the removal of his sin: when He
maketh all alter-stones like chalk-stones that
are broken in pieces, Astarte images and sun-pillars
do not rise up again. 10.&nbsp;For the
strong city is solitary, a dwelling given up and
forsaken like the steppe: there calves feed, and
there they lie down, and eat of its branches.

Jerusalem, and Consolation for Both.</i>&mdash;<span class="smcap">Chap. xxviii.</span></p>

<p>1. Woe to the proud crown of the drunken
of Ephraim, and to the fading flower of its
splendid ornament, which is upon the head of
the luxuriant valley of those slain with wine.</p>

<p>2. Behold, the Lord holds a strong and
mighty thing like a hailstorm, a pestilent
tempest; like a storm of mighty overflowing
waters, He casts down to the earth with almighty
hand. 3.&nbsp;With feet they tread down
the proud crown of the drunken of Ephraim.
4.&nbsp;And it happens to the fading flower of its
splendid ornament, which is upon the head of
the luxuriant valley, as to an early fig before
it is harvest, which whosoever sees it looks at, and
it is no longer in his hand than he swallows it.</p>

<p>5. In that day will Jehovah of hosts be the
adorning crown and the splendid diadem to
the remnant of His people; 6.&nbsp;and the spirit
<span class="pagenum" id="pA30R">[p.&nbsp;A30R]</span>
of justice to them that sit on the judgment-seat,
and heroic strength to them that drive
back war at the gate.</p>

<p>7. And they also reel with wine, and are
giddy with meth; priest and prophet reel with
meth, reel when seeking visions, stagger when
pronouncing judgment. 8.&nbsp;For all tables are
full of filthy vomit, without any more place.</p>

<p>9. Whom then would He teach knowledge?
And to whom make preaching intelligible?
To those weaned from the milk. To those
removed from the breast. 10.&nbsp;For precept
upon precept, precept upon precept, line upon
line, line upon line, a little here, a little there?</p>

<p>11. For through men stammering in speech,
and through a strange tongue will He speak
to this people. 12.&nbsp;He who said to them,
There is rest, give rest to weary ones, and
there is refreshing! But they would not hear.
13.&nbsp;Therefore the word of Jehovah becomes
to them precept upon precept, precept upon
precept, line upon line, line upon line, a little
here, a little there, that they may go and
stumble backwards, and be wrecked to pieces,
and be snared and taken.</p>

<p>14. Therefore hear the word of Jehovah, ye
scornful lords, rulers of this people which is
in Jerusalem! 15.&nbsp;For ye say, We have made
a covenant with death, and with Hades we
have come to an agreement. The swelling
scourge, when it cometh hither, will do us no
harm: for we have made a lie our shelter,
and in deceit have we hidden ourselves.
16.&nbsp;Therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah, Behold,
I am He who laid in Zion a stone, a
stone of trial, a precious corner-stone of well-founded
founding; whoever believes will not
have to move. 17.&nbsp;And I make justice the
line, and righteousness the level; and hail
sweeps away the refuge of lies, and the hiding-place
is washed away by waters.</p>

<p>18. And your covenant with death is
struck out, and your agreement with Hades
will not stand; the swelling scourge when it
comes, ye will become a thing trodden down
to it. 19.&nbsp;And as often as it passes it takes
you: for every morning it passes, by day and
by night; and it is nothing but shuddering to
hear such preaching. 20.&nbsp;For the bed is too
short to stretch in, and the covering too tight
when a man wraps himself in it.</p>

<p>21. For Jehovah will rise up as in the
mountain of Perazim, and be wroth as in the
valley at Gibeon to work His work; and to
set His act; strange is His act.</p>

<p>22. And now drive ye not mockeries, lest
your fetters be strengthened: for I have heard
from the Lord, Jehovah of hosts, a judgment
of destruction, and an irrevocable one, upon
the whole earth.</p>

<p>23. Lend me your ear, and hear my voice;
attend, and hear my address! 24.&nbsp;Does the
husbandman plough continually to sow? to
furrow and to harrow his land? 25.&nbsp;Is it not
so: when he levels the surface thereof, he
scatters black poppy seed, and strews cummin,
and puts in wheat in rows, and barley in the
<span class="pagenum" id="pA31R">[p.&nbsp;A31R]</span>
appointed piece, and spelt on its border?
26.&nbsp;And He has instructed him how to act rightly:
his God teaches him.</p>

<p>27. For the black poppy is not threshed
with a threshing sledge, nor is a cart wheel
rolled over cummin; but black poppy is
knocked out with a stick, and cummin with a
staff. 28.&nbsp;Is bread-corn crushed? No; he
does not go on threshing for ever, and drive
the wheel of his cart and his horses over it:
he does not crush it. 29.&nbsp;This also, it goeth
forth from Jehovah of hosts: He gives wonderful
intelligence, high understanding.</p>

<p class="tdc"><i>The Second Woe.&mdash;The Oppression and Deliverance
of Ariel.</i>&mdash;<span class="smcap">Chap. xxix.</span></p>

<p>1. Woe to Ariel, to Ariel, the castle where
David pitched his tent! Add year to year,
let the feasts revolve: 2.&nbsp;then I distress Ariel,
and there is groaning and moaning; and so
she proves herself to Me as Ariel. 3.&nbsp;And I
encamp in a circle round about thee, and surround
thee with watch-posts, and erect tortoises
against thee. 4.&nbsp;And when brought
down thou wilt speak out of the ground, and
thy speaking will sound low out of the dust;
and thy voice cometh up like that of a demon
from the ground, and thy speaking will
whisper out of the dust.</p>

<p>5. And the multitude of thy foes will become
like finely powdered dust, and the multitude
of tyrants like chaff flying away; and
it will take place suddenly, very suddenly.
6.&nbsp;For Jehovah of hosts there comes a visitation
with crash of thunder and earthquake
and great noise, whirlwind and tempest, and
the blazing up of devouring fire. 7.&nbsp;And the
multitude of all the nations that gather together
against Ariel, and all those who storm
and distress Ariel and her stronghold, will be
like a vision of the night in a dream. 8.&nbsp;And it
is just as a hungry man dreams, and behold he
eats; and when he wakes up his soul is empty:
and just as a thirsty man dreams, and behold
he drinks; and when he wakes up, behold, he is
faint, and his soul is parched with thirst: so
will it be to the multitude of nations which
gather together against the mountain of Zion.</p>

<p>9. Stop and stare; blind yourselves, and
grow blind!</p>

<p>They are drunken, and not with wine; they
reel, and not with meth. 10.&nbsp;For Jehovah
hath poured upon you a spirit of deep sleep,
and bound up your eyes; the prophets and
your heads, the seers, He has veiled. 11.&nbsp;And
the revelation of all this will be to you like
the words of a sealed writing, which they give
to him that understands writing, say, Pray,
read this; but he says, I cannot, it is sealed.
12.&nbsp;And they give the writing to one who
does not understand writing, saying, Pray, read
this; but he says, I do not understand writing.</p>

<p>13. The Lord hath spoken: Because this
people approaches Me with its mouth, and
honours Me with its lips, and keeps its heart far
from Me, and its reverence for Me has become
as a commandment learned from men;
<span class="pagenum" id="pA32R">[p.&nbsp;A32R]</span>
14.&nbsp;therefore, behold, I will proceed wondrously
with this people, wondrously and marvellously
strange; and the wisdom of its wise men is
lost, and the understanding of its intelligent
men becomes invisible.</p>

<p>15. Woe unto them that hide plans deep
from Jehovah, and their doing occurs in a dark
place, and they say, Who saw us then, and
who know about us? 16.&nbsp;Oh for your perversity!
It is to be regarded as potter&rsquo;s clay;
that a work could say to its maker, He has not
made me; and an image to its sculptor, He
does not understand it!</p>

<p>17. Is it not yet a very little, and Lebanon
is turned into a fruitful field, and the fruitful
field esteemed as a forest? 18.&nbsp;And in that
day the deaf hear scripture words, and the
eyes of the blind will see out of obscurity and
out of darkness. 19.&nbsp;And the joy of the
humble increases in Jehovah, and the poor
among men will rejoice in the Holy One of
Israel. 20.&nbsp;For tyrants are gone, and it is
over with scoffers; and all who think evil are
rooted out, 21.&nbsp;who condemn a man for a
word, and lay snares for him that is free-spoken
in the gate, and overthrow the righteous
through shameful lies.</p>

<p>22. Therefore thus saith Jehovah of the
house of Jacob, He who redeemed Abraham:
Jacob shall not henceforth be ashamed, nor
shall his face turn pale any more. 23.&nbsp;For
when he, when his children see the work of
My hands in the midst of him, they will
sanctify My name and sanctify the Holy One
of Jacob, and shudder before the God of
Israel. 24.&nbsp;And those who were of an erring
spirit discern understanding, and murmurers
accept instruction.</p>

Jehovah, to drive plans, and not by My impulse,
and to plait alliance, and not according
to My spirit, to heap sin upon sin; 2.&nbsp;that go
away to travel down to Egypt, without having
asked My mouth, to fly to Pharaoh&rsquo;s shelter,
and to conceal themselves under the shadow
of Egypt. 3.&nbsp;And Pharaoh&rsquo;s shelter becomes
a shame to them, and the concealment under
the shadow of Egypt is a disgrace. 4.&nbsp;For
Judah&rsquo;s princes have appeared in Zoan, and
his ambassadors arrive in Haran. 5.&nbsp;They
will all have to be ashamed of a people useless
to them, that brings no help and no use, but
shame, and also reproach.</p>

<p>6. Oracle concerning the water-oxen of
the south: Through a land of distress and
confinement, whence the lioness and lion,
adders and flying dragons; they carry their
possessions on the shoulders of asses&rsquo; foals,
and their treasures on the humps of camels, to
a nation that profits nothing. 7.&nbsp;And Egypt,
worthlessly and hollowly will they help; therefore
I call this Egypt, Great-mouth sits still.</p>

<span class="pagenum" id="pA33R">[p.&nbsp;A33R]</span>
and note it in a book, and let it stand there
for future days, for ever, to eternity.</p>

<p>9. For it is a refractory people, lying children,
children who do not like to hear the
instruction of Jehovah; 10.&nbsp;who say to the seers,
See not; and to the prophets, Prophesy not unto
us right things! Speak flatteries to us!
11.&nbsp;Get out of the way, turn aside from the path,
remove from our face the Holy One of Israel.</p>

<p>12. Therefore thus saith the Holy One of
Israel, Because ye dislike this word, and put
your trust in force and shufflings, and rely
upon this; 13.&nbsp;therefore will this iniquity be
to like a falling breach, bent forwards in
a high-towering wall, which falls to ruin suddenly,
very suddenly. 14.&nbsp;And He smites it
to pieces, as a potter&rsquo;s vessel falls to pieces
when they smash it without sparing, and of
which, when it lies smashed to pieces there, you
cannot find a sherd to fetch fire with from the
hearth, or to take water with out of a cistern.</p>

<p>15. For thus saith the Lord Jehovah, the
Holy One of Israel, Through turning and rest
ye would be helped; your strength would
show itself in quietness and confidence; but ye
would not. 16.&nbsp;And ye said, No, but we will
fly upon horses; therefore ye shall flee: and,
We will ride upon race-horses; therefore your
pursuers will race. 17.&nbsp;A thousand, ye will
flee from the threatening of one, from the
threatening of five, until ye are reduced to a
remnant, like a pine upon the top of the
mountain, and like a banner upon the hill.</p>

<p>18. And therefore will Jehovah wait till He
inclines towards you, and therefore will He
withdraw Himself on high till He has mercy
upon you; for Jehovah is a God of right, salvation
to those who wait for Him.</p>

<p>19. For a people continues dwelling in
Zion, in Jerusalem; thou shalt not weep for
ever: He will prove Himself gracious to thee
at the sound of thy cry for help; as soon as
He hears, He answers thee. 20.&nbsp;And the Lord
giveth you bread in penury, and water for
your need; and thy teachers will not hide
themselves any more, and thine eyes come to
see thy teachers. 21.&nbsp;And thine ears will
hear words behind thee, saying, &ldquo;This is the
way, walk ye in it!&rdquo; whether ye turn to the
right hand or the left. 22.&nbsp;And ye defile the
covering of thy graven images of silver, and
the clothing of thy molten images of gold;
thou wilt scatter them like a filthy thing:
&ldquo;Get out!&rdquo; thou sayest to it.</p>

<p>23. And He gives rain to thy seed, with
which thou sowest the land; and bread of the
produce of the land, and it is full of sap and
fat; in that day your flocks will feed in roomy
pastures. 24.&nbsp;And the oxen and the young
asses, which work the land, salted mash will
they eat, which is winnowed with the winnowing
shovel and winnowing fork! 25.&nbsp;And
upon every high mountain, and every hill that
rises high, there are springs, brooks in the day
of the great massacre, when the towers fall.</p>

<p>26. And the light of the moon will be as
<span class="pagenum" id="pA34R">[p.&nbsp;A34R]</span>
light of the sun, and the light of the sun
will be multiplied sevenfold, like the light of
seven days, in the day that Jehovah bindeth
the hurt of His people, and healeth the crushing
of His stroke.</p>

<p>27. Behold, the name of Jehovah cometh
from far, burning His wrath, and quantity of
smoke: His lips are full of wrathful foam,
and His tongue like devouring fire. 28.&nbsp;And
His breath is like an overflowing brook, which
reaches half-way to the neck, to sift nations in
the sieve of nothingness; and a misleading
bridle comes to the cheeks of the nations.</p>

<p>29. Your song will then sound as in the
night, when the feast is celebrated; and ye
will have joy of heart like those who march
with the playing of flutes, to go up to the
mountain of Jehovah, to the Rock of Israel.</p>

<p>30. And Jehovah causes His majestic voice
to be heard, and causes the lowering of His
arm to be seen, with the snorting of wrath
and the blazing of devouring fire, the bursting
of a cloud, and pouring of rain and hailstones.
31.&nbsp;For Asshur will be terrified at the voice
of Jehovah, when He smites with the staff.
32.&nbsp;And it will come to pass every stroke of
the rod of destiny, which Jehovah causes to
fall upon Asshur, is dealt amid the noise of
drums and the playing of guitars; and in
battles of swinging arm He fights it. 33.&nbsp;For
a place for the sacrifice of abominations has
long been made ready, even for the king it is
prepared: deep, broad has He made it: its
funeral-pile has fire and wood in abundance;
the breath of Jehovah like a stream of brimstone
sets it on fire.</p>

<p class="tdc"><i>The Fourth Woe.&mdash;The False Help; the Despised
One Pitied; and the New Era.</i>&mdash;<span class="smcap">Chaps. xxxi.&ndash;xxxii.&nbsp;8.</span></p>

<p>1. Woe to them that go down to Egypt for
help, and rely upon horses, and put their
trust in chariots, that there are many of them,
and in horsemen, that there is a powerful
multitude of them: and to not look up to the
Holy One of Israel, and do not inquire for
Jehovah! 2.&nbsp;And yet He also is wise; thus
then He brings evil, and sets not His words
aside; and rises up against the house of miscreants,
and against the help of evil-doers.
3.&nbsp;And Egypt is man, and not God; and its
horses flesh, and not spirit. And when Jehovah
stretches out His hand, the helper
stumbles, and he that is helped falls, and they
all perish together.</p>

<p>4. For thus hath Jehovah spoken unto me,
As the lion growls and the young lion over its
prey, against which a whole crowd of shepherds
is called together; he is not alarmed at their
cry, and does not surrender at their noise; so
will Jehovah of hosts descend to the campaign
against the mountain of Zion, and against
their hill. 5.&nbsp;Like fluttering birds, so will
Jehovah of hosts screen Jerusalem; screening
and delivering, sparing and setting free.</p>

<p>6. Then turn, O sons of Israel, to Him
<span class="pagenum" id="pA35R">[p.&nbsp;A35R]</span>
from whom men have so deeply departed.
7.&nbsp;For in that day they will abhor every one
their silver idols and their gold idols, which
your hands have made to you for a sin.
8.&nbsp;And Asshur falls by a sword not of a man,
and a sword not of a man will devour him;
and he flees before a sword, and his young men
become tributary. 9.&nbsp;And his rock, for fear
it will pass away, and his princes be frightened
away by the flags: the saying of Jehovah, who
has His fire in Zion, and His furnace in
Jerusalem.</p>

<p>XXXII.&mdash;1. Behold the king will reign
according to righteousness; and the princes,
according to right will they command.
2.&nbsp;And every one will be like a shelter from the
wind, and a covert from the storm; like
water-brooks in a dry place, like the shadow
of a gigantic rock in a languishing land.</p>

<p>3. And the eyes of the seeing no more are
closed, and the ears of the hearing attend.
4.&nbsp;And the heart of the hurried understands to
know, and the tongue of stammerers speaks
clear things with readiness.</p>

<p>5. The fool will no more be called a nobleman,
nor the crafty a gentleman. 6.&nbsp;For a
fool speaks follies, and his heart does godless
things, to practise tricks and to speak error
against Jehovah, to leave the soul of hungry
men empty, and to withhold the drink of
thirsty ones. 7.&nbsp;And the craft of the crafty
man is evil, who devises stratagems to destroy
suffering ones by lying words, even when the
needy exhibits his right. 8.&nbsp;But a noble man
deviseth noble things, and to noble things he
adheres.</p>

<p>9. Ye contented women, rise up, hear my
voice, ye confident daughters, hearken to my
speech! 10.&nbsp;Days to the year: then will ye
tremble, confident ones! for it is all over with
the vintage, the fruit harvest comes to nought.
11.&nbsp;Tremble, contented ones! Quake, ye
confident ones! Strip, make yourselves bare,
and gird your loins with sackcloth!
12.&nbsp;They smite upon their breasts for the pleasant
fields, for the fruitful vine. 13.&nbsp;On the land
of my people there come up weeds, briers;
yes, upon all joyous houses of the rejoicing
city. 14.&nbsp;For the palace is made solitary:
the crowd of the city is left desolate; the ophel
and watch-tower serve as caves for ever, for
the delight of wild asses, for the tending of
flocks.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="pA36R">[p.&nbsp;A36R]</span>
15. Until the Spirit is poured out over us
from on high, and the wilderness becomes a
fruitful field, and the fruitful field is counted
as the forest. 16.&nbsp;And justice makes its
abode in the desert, and righteousness settles
down upon the fruit-field. 17.&nbsp;And the
effect of righteousness will be peace, and the
reward of righteousness rest and security for
ever. 18.&nbsp;And my people dwells in a place of
peace, and in trustworthy, safe dwellings, and
in cheerful resting-places. 19.&nbsp;And it hails
with the overthrow of the forest, and into
lowliness must the city be brought low.</p>

freedom.</p>

<p>1. Woe, devastator, and thyself not devastated;
and thou spoiler, and still not spoiled!
Hast thou not done with devastating? thou
shalt be devastated. Hast thou attained to
rob? men rob thee.</p>

<p>2. Jehovah, be gracious to us; we wait for
Thee: be their arm every morning, yea, our
salvation in time of need!</p>

<p>3. At the sound of a noise peoples pass
away: at Thy rising nations are scattered.
4.&nbsp;And your booty is swept away as a swarm
of locusts sweeps away; as beetles run, they
run upon it.</p>

<p>5. Jehovah is exalted; for dwelling on
high, He has filled Zion with justice and
righteousness. 6.&nbsp;And there will be security
of thy times, riches of salvation, of wisdom,
and knowledge. Fear of Jehovah is then the
treasure of Judah.</p>

<p>7. Behold, their heroes weep without; the
messengers of peace weep bitterly. 8.&nbsp;Desolate
are roads, disappeared are travellers; he
has broken covenant, insulted cities, despised
men. 9.&nbsp;The land mourns, languishes; Lebanon
stands ashamed, parched; the meadow
of Sharon has become like a steppe, and
Bashan and Carmel shake their leaves.
10.&nbsp;Now will I arise, saith Jehovah, now exalt
Myself, now lift up Myself.</p>

<p>11. Ye are pregnant with hay, ye bring
forth stubble! Your snorting is the fire that
will devour you. 12.&nbsp;And nations become
as lime burnings, thorns cut off, which are
kindled with fire.</p>

<p>13. Hear, ye distant ones, what I have
accomplished; and perceive, ye near ones, my
omnipotence! 14.&nbsp;The sinners in Zion are
afraid; trembling seizes the hypocrites: who
of us can dwell with devouring fire? who of us
abide with everlasting burnings?</p>

<p>15. He that walketh in righteousness, and
speaketh uprightness; he that despiseth gain
of oppressions, whose hand keepeth from
grasping bribes; he that stoppeth his ear
from hearing murderous counsel, and shutteth
his eyes from looking at evil; 16.&nbsp;he will
dwell upon high places; rocky fastnesses are
<span class="pagenum" id="pA37R">[p.&nbsp;A37R]</span>
his castle; his bread is abundant, his waters
inexhaustible.</p>

<p>17. Thine eyes will see the King in His
beauty, will see a land that is very far off.</p>

<p>18. Thy heart meditates upon the shuddering.
Where is the valuer? where is the
weigher? where he who counted the towers?
19.&nbsp;The rough people thou seest no more, a people
of deep inaudible lip, of stammering unintelligible
tongue.</p>

<p>20. Look upon Zion, the castle of our festal
meeting. Thine eyes will see Jerusalem, a
pleasant place, a tent that does not wander
about, whose pegs are never drawn, and none
of whose cords are ever broken. 21.&nbsp;No,
there dwells for us a glorious One, Jehovah;
a place of streams, canals of wide extent, into
which no fleet of rowing vessels ventures, and
which no strong man of war shall cross.
22.&nbsp;For Jehovah is our Judge; Jehovah is our
war-Prince; Jehovah is our King; He will
bring us salvation.</p>

<p>23. Thy ropes hang loose; they do not hold
fast the support of thy mast; they do not
hold the flag extended: then is the booty of
plunder divided in abundance; even lame
men share the prey. 24.&nbsp;And not an inhabitant
will say, I am weak: the people settled
there have their sins forgiven.</p>

<p>1. Come near, ye peoples, to hear; and ye
nations, attend. Let the earth hear, and
that which fills it, the world, and everything
that springs from it. 2.&nbsp;For the indignation
of Jehovah will fall upon all nations, and
burning wrath upon all their host; He has
laid the ban upon them, delivered them to
the slaughter. 3.&nbsp;And their slain are cast
away, and their corpses&mdash;their stench will
arise, and mountains melt with their blood.
4.&nbsp;And all the host of the heavens are rolled
up like a scroll, and all their heat withers as
a leaf withers away from the vine, and like
withered leaves from the fig-tree.</p>

<p>5. For My sword has become intoxicated
in the heaven; behold, it comes down upon
Edom, and upon the people of My ban to
judgment. 6.&nbsp;The sword of Jehovah fills
itself with blood, is fattened with fat, with
blood of lambs and he-goats, with kidney-fat
of rams; for Jehovah has a sacrifice in
Bozrah, and a great slaughter in the land of
Edom. 7.&nbsp;And buffaloes fall with them, and
bullocks together with bulls; and their land
becomes intoxicated with blood, and their
dust fattened with fat.</p>

<p>8. For Jehovah hath a day of vengeance, a
year of recompense, to contend for Zion.
9.&nbsp;And the brooks of Edom are turned into
pitch, and its dust into brimstone, and its
land becomes burning pitch. 10.&nbsp;Day and
<span class="pagenum" id="pA38R">[p.&nbsp;A38R]</span>
night it is not quenched; the smoke of
Edom goes up for ever: it lies waste from
generation to generation; no one passes
through it for ever and ever. 11.&nbsp;And
pelican and hedgehog take possession of it,
and eared-owl and raven dwell there; and
He stretched over it the measure of Tohu and
the level of Bohu. 12.&nbsp;Its nobles&mdash;there is
no longer a monarchy which they elected;
nettles and thistles in the castles; and it
and all its princes come to nought. 13.&nbsp;And
the palaces of Edom break out into thorns,
nettles and thistles in the castles; and it
becomes the abode of wild dogs, pasture for
ostriches. 14.&nbsp;And martens meet with jackals,
and a wood-devil runs upon its fellow; yea,
L&#299;l&#299;th dwells there, and finds rest for itself.
15.&nbsp;There the arrow-snake makes its nest, and
breeds and lays eggs, and broods in the
shadow there; yea, there vultures gather one
to another. 16.&nbsp;Search in the book of
Jehovah, and read! Not one of the creatures
falls, not one misses the other: for
My mouth&mdash;it has commanded it; and His
breath&mdash;it has brought them together.
17.&nbsp;And He has cast the lots for them, and His
hand has assigned it (this land) to them by
measure; they will possess it for ever; to
generation and generation they will dwell
therein.</p>

<p>XXXV.&mdash;1. Gladness fills the desert and
the heath; and the steppe rejoices, and
flowers like the crocus. 2.&nbsp;It flowers abundantly,
and rejoices; yea, rejoicing and singing:
the glory of Lebanon is given to it, the
splendour of Carmel and the plain of Sharon;
they will see the glory of Jehovah, the splendour
of our God.</p>

<p>3. Strengthen ye the weak hands, and
make the trembling knees strong. 4.&nbsp;Say to
those of a terrified heart, Be strong, Fear ye
not! Behold, your God will come for vengeance,
for a Divine retribution: He will come,
and bring you salvation. 5.&nbsp;Then the eyes of
the blind will be opened, and the ears of the
deaf unstopped. 6.&nbsp;Then will the lame man
leap as the stag, and the tongue of the dumb
man shout; for waters break out in the
desert, and brooks in the steppe. 7.&nbsp;And
the mirage becomes a fish-pond, and the
thirsty ground gushing water-springs; in the
place of jackals, where it lies, there springs
up grass with reeds and rushes.</p>

<p>8. And a highway rises there, and a road,
and it will be called the Holy Road; no
unclean man will pass along it, as it is
appointed for them: whoever walks the road,
even simple ones do not go astray. 9.&nbsp;There
will be no lion there, and the most ravenous
beast of prey will not approach it, will not be
met with there; and redeemed ones walk.
10.&nbsp;And the ransomed of Jehovah will return,
and come to Zion with shouting, and everlasting
joy upon their heads; they lay hold of
gladness and joy, and sorrow and sighing flee
away.</p>

Surrender of Jerusalem.</i>&mdash;<span class="smcap">Chaps. xxxvi.&ndash;xxxvii.&nbsp;7.</span></p>

<p>XXXVI.&mdash;1. And it came to pass in the
fourteenth year of king Hizikiyahu, Sancher&icirc;b,
king of Asshur, came up against all the fortified
cities of Judah, and took them. 2.&nbsp;Then
the king of Asshur sent Rabshakeh from
Lachish towards Jerusalem to king Hizkiyahu
with a great army, and he advanced to the
conduit of the upper pool by the road of the
fuller&rsquo;s field; 3.&nbsp;and there went out to him
Eliakim, son of Hilkiyahu, the house-minister,
and Shebna the chancellor, and Joah, son of
Asaph the recorder.</p>

<p>4. And Rabshakeh said to them, Say now
to Hizkiyahu, Thus saith the great king, the
king of Asshur, What sort of confidence is
this that thou hast got? 5.&nbsp;I say, Vain talk
is counsel and strength for war: now, then, in
whom dost thou trust, that thou hast rebelled
against me? 6.&nbsp;Behold, thou trustest in this
broken reed-staff there, in Egypt, on which
one leans, and it runs into his hand and
pierces it; so does Pharaoh king of Egypt
to all who trust in him. 7.&nbsp;But if thou
sayest to me, We trust in Jehovah our God;
is it not He whose high places and altars
Hizkiyahu has removed, and has said to
Judah and Jerusalem, Ye shall worship before
the altar? 8.&nbsp;And not take a wager
with my lord the king of Asshur; I will
deliver thee two thousand horses, if thou
art able for thy part to give horsemen upon
them. 9.&nbsp;And how couldst thou repel the
advance of a single satrap among the least
of the servants of my lord? Thou puttest
thy trust then in Egypt for chariots and
riders! 10.&nbsp;And now have I come up without
Jehovah against this land to destroy it?
Jehovah said to me, Go up to this land, and
destroy it.</p>

<p>11. Then said Eliakim, and Shebna, and
Joah, to Rabshakeh, Pray, speak to thy
servants in Aram&aelig;an, for we understand it;
and do not speak to us in Jewish, in the
ears of the people that are on the wall.</p>

<p>12. Then Rabshakeh said to them, Has
my lord sent me to thy lord and to thee, not
rather to the men who sit upon the wall, to
eat their dung, and to drink their urine
together with you?</p>

<p>13. Then Rabshakeh went near, and cried
with a loud voice in the Jewish language, and
said, Hear the words of the great king, the
king of Asshur. 14.&nbsp;Thus saith the king,
Let not Hizkiyahu practise deception upon
you; for he cannot deliver you. 15.&nbsp;And
let not Hizkiyahu feed you with hope in
Jehovah, saying, Jehovah will deliver, yea,
<span class="pagenum" id="pA40R">[p.&nbsp;A40R]</span>
deliver us: this city will not be delivered
into the hand of the king of Asshur.
16.&nbsp;Hearken not to Hizkiyahu; for thus saith
the king of Asshur, Enter into a connection
of mutual good wishes with me, and come out
to me: and enjoy every one his vine, and
every one his fig-tree, and drink every one
the water of his cistern: 17.&nbsp;till I come and
take you away into a land like your own land,
a land of corn and wine, a land of bread-corn
and vineyards; 18.&nbsp;that Hizkiyahu do
not befool you, saying, Jehovah will deliver
us. Have the gods of the nations delivered
every one his land out of the hand of the
king of Asshur? 19.&nbsp;Where are the gods of
Hamath and Arpad? Where the gods of
Sepharvayim? and how much less have they
delivered that Samaria out of my hand?
20.&nbsp;Who were they among all the gods of these
lands who delivered their land out of my
hand? how much less will Jehovah deliver
Jerusalem out of my hand?</p>

<p>21. But they held their peace, and answered
him not a word; for it was the king&rsquo;s commandment,
Ye shall not answer him.</p>

<p>22. Then came Eliakim, son of Hilkiyahu,
the house-minister, and Shebna that chancellor,
and Joah son of Asaph the recorder,
to Hizkiyahu, with torn clothes, and told
him the words of Rabshakeh.</p>

<p>XXXVII.&mdash;1. And it came to pass, when
king Hizkiyahu had heard, he rent his
clothes, and wrapped himself in mourning
linen, and went into the house of Jehovah.
2.&nbsp;And sent Eliakim the house-minister, and
Shebna the chancellor, and the eldest of the
priests, wrapped in mourning linen, to Isaiah
son of Amoz, the prophet. 3.&nbsp;And they say
to him, Thus saith Hizkiyahu, A day of
affliction, and punishment, and blasphemy
is this day; for children are come to the
matrix, and there is no strength to bring
them forth. 4.&nbsp;Perhaps Jehovah thy God
will hear the words of Rabshakeh, with which
the king of Asshur his lord has sent him to
revile the living God; and Jehovah thy God
will punish for the words He hath heard, and
thou wilt make intercession for the remnant
that still exists.</p>

<p>5. And the servants of king Hizkiyahu
came to Isaiah. 6.&nbsp;And Isaiah said to them,
Speak thus to your lord, Thus saith Jehovah,
Be not afraid of the words which thou hast
heard, with which the servants of the king of
Asshur have blasphemed Me. 7.&nbsp;Behold, I
will bring a spirit upon him, and he will hear
a hearsay, and return to his own land; and
I will cut him down with the sword in his
own land.</p>

Surrender of Jerusalem. Its Miraculous
Deliverance.</i>&mdash;<span class="smcap">Chap. xxxvii.&nbsp;8&ndash;38.</span></p>

<p>8. Rabshakeh thereupon returned, and
found the king of Asshur warring against
Libnah; for he had heard that he had withdrawn
<span class="pagenum" id="pA41R">[p.&nbsp;A41R]</span>
from Lachish. 9.&nbsp;And he had heard
say concerning Tirhakah king of Ethiopia,
he has come out to make war against thee;
and heard, and sent messengers to Hiskiyahu,
saying, 10.&nbsp;Thus shall ye say to Hizkiyahu
king of Judah, saying, Let not the God in
whom thou trustest deceive thee, saying, Jerusalem
shall not be given into the hand of the
king of Asshur. 11.&nbsp;Behold, thou hast surely
heard what the kings of Asshur have done to
all lands, to lay the ban upon them; and
thou, thou shouldest be delivered? 12.&nbsp;Have
the gods of the nations, which my fathers
destroyed, delivered them? Gozan, and Haran,
and Rezeph, and the B&bull;n&#x113;-&rsquo;Eden, which are
in Telassar? 13.&nbsp;Where is the king of
Hamath, and the king of Arpad, and the
king of &lsquo;Ir-Sepharvayim, Hen&lsquo;a, and &lsquo;Ivah?</p>

<p>14. And Hizkiyahu took the letter out of
the hand of the messengers, and read it, and
went up to the house of Jehovah; and
Hizkiyahu spread it before Jehovah.
15.&nbsp;And Hizkiyahu prayed to Jehovah, saying,
16.&nbsp;Jehovah of hosts, God of Israel, enthroned
upon the cherubim, Thou, yea Thou alone, art
God of all the kingdoms of the earth; Thou,
Thou hast made the heavens and the earth.
17.&nbsp;Incline Thine ear, Jehovah, and hear!
Open Thine eyes, Jehovah, and see; and
hear the words of Sennacherib, which he hath
sent to despise the living God! 18.&nbsp;Truly, O
Jehovah, the kings of Asshur have laid waste
all lands, and their land, 19.&nbsp;and have put
their gods into the fire: for they were not
gods, only the work of men&rsquo;s hands, wood and
stone; therefore they have destroyed them.
20.&nbsp;And now, Jehovah our God, help us out
of his hand, and all the kingdoms of the earth
may know that Thou Jehovah art it alone.</p>

<p>21. And Isaiah the son of Amoz sent to
Hizkiyahu, saying, Thus saith Jehovah the
God of Israel, That which thou hast prayed
to me concerning Sennacherib the king of
Asshur: 22.&nbsp;This is the utterance which
Jehovah utters concerning him:&mdash;The virgin
daughter of Zion despiseth thee, laugheth
thee to scorn; the daughter of Jerusalem
shaketh her head after thee. 23.&nbsp;Whom hast
thou reviled and blasphemed, and over whom
hast thou spoken loftily, that thou hast lifted
up thine eyes on high? Against the Holy
One of Israel. 24.&nbsp;By thy servants hast
thou reviled the Lord, in that thou sayest,
&ldquo;With the multitude of my chariots have I
climbed the height of the mountains, the
inner side of Lebanon; and I shall fell the
lofty growth of its cedars, the choice of its
cypresses; and I shall penetrate to the height
of its uttermost border, the grove of its
orchard. 25.&nbsp;I, I have digged and drank
waters, and will make dry with the sole of
my feet all the Nile-arms.&rdquo; 26.&nbsp;Hast thou
not heard? I have done it long ago, from the
days of ancient time have I formed it, and
now brought it to pass, that thou shouldest
lay waste fortified cities into desolate stone
heaps; 27.&nbsp;and their inhabitants, powerless,
<span class="pagenum" id="pA42R">[p.&nbsp;A42R]</span>
were terrified, and were put to shame: became
herb of the field and green of the turf, herb
of the house-tops, and a cornfield before the
blades. 28.&nbsp;And thy sitting down, and thy
going out, and thy entering in, I know; and
thy heating thyself against Me. 29.&nbsp;On
account of thy heating thyself against Me,
and because thy self-confidence has risen up
into Mine ears, I put My ring into thy nose,
and My muzzle into thy lips, and lead thee
back by the way by which thou hast come.</p>

<p>30. And let this be a sign to thee, Men eat
this year what is self-sown; and in the
second year what springs from the roots;
and in the third year they sow and reap and
plant vineyards, and eat their fruit. 31.&nbsp;And
that which is escaped of the house of Judah,
that which remains will again take root
downward, and bear fruit upward. 32.&nbsp;For
from Jerusalem will a remnant go forth, and
a fugitive from Mount Zion; the zeal of
Jehovah of hosts will carry this out.</p>

<p>33. Therefore thus saith Jehovah concerning
the king of Asshur, He will not enter
into this city, nor shoot off an arrow there;
nor do they assault it with a shield, nor cast
up earthworks against it. 34.&nbsp;By the way
by which he came will he return; and he will
not enter into this city, saith Jehovah.
35.&nbsp;And I shield this city, to help, for Mine own
sake, and for the sake of David My servant.</p>

<p>36. Then the angel of Jehovah went forth
and smote in the camp of Asshur a hundred
and eighty-five thousand; and when men
rose up in the morning, behold, they were
all dead corpses. 37.&nbsp;Then Sennacherib
king of Asshur decamped, and went forth and
returned, and settled down in Nineveh.
38.&nbsp;And it came to pass, as he was worshipping
in the temple of Nisroch his god, Adrammelech
and Sharazer his sons smote him with
the sword; and when they escaped to the
land of Ararat, Esar-haddon reigned in his
stead.</p>

<p class="tdc"><i>C.&mdash;Hezekiah&rsquo;s Illness. Isaiah Assures Him of

<p>1. In those days Hizkiyahu became dangerously
ill. And Isaiah son of Amoz, the
prophet, came to him, and said to him, Thus
saith Jehovah, Set thine house in order; for
thou wilt die, and not recover. 2.&nbsp;Then
Hizkiyahu turned his face to the wall, and
prayed to Jehovah, 3.&nbsp;and said, O Jehovah,
remember this, I pray, that I have walked
before Thee in truth, and with the whole
heart, and have done what was good in Thine
eyes. And Hizkiyahu wept with loud weeping.</p>

<p>4. And it came to pass the word of Jehovah
came to Isaiah as follows: 5.&nbsp;Go and say
to Hizkiyahu, Thus saith Jehovah, the God
of David thine ancestor, I have heard thy
prayer, seen thy tears; behold, I add to thy

<p class="tdc"><i>D.&mdash;Threatening of the Babylonish Captivity
Occasioned by Hezekiah.</i>&mdash;<span class="smcap">Chap. xxxix.</span></p>

<p>1. At that time Merodach Bal&rsquo;adan, son of
Bal&rsquo;adan king of Babel, sent writings and a
present to Hizkiyahu, and heard that he had
been sick, and was restored again.</p>

<p>2. And Hizkiyahu rejoiced concerning
them, and showed them all his storehouses:
the silver, and the gold and the spices, and
the fine oil, and all his arsenal, and all that
was in his treasures: there was nothing that
Hizkiyahu had now shown them in all his
house or in all his kingdom.</p>

<p>3. Then came Isaiah the prophet to king
Hizkiyahu, and said to him, What have these
men said, and whence came they to thee?
Hizkiyahu said, They came to me from a far
country, out of Babel. 4.&nbsp;He said further,
What have they seen in thy house? Hizkiyahu
said, All that is in my house have they seen;
there was nothing in my treasures that I had
not shown them. 5.&nbsp;Then Isaiah said to
Hizkiyahu, Hear the word of Jehovah of
hosts; 6.&nbsp;Behold, days come, that all that is
in thy house, and all that thy fathers have
laid up unto this day, will be carried away to
Babel: nothing will be left behind, saith
Jehovah. 7.&nbsp;And of thy children that proceed
from thee, whom thou shalt beget, will they
take; and they will be courtiers in the palace
of the king of Babel. 8.&nbsp;Then said Hizkiyahu
to Isaiah, Good is the word of Jehovah which
thou hast spoken. And he said further, Yea,
there shall be peace and steadfastness in my
days.</p>

<p class="tdc"><span class="smcap">first prophecy.&mdash;chap. xl.</span></p>

<p class="tdc"><i>Words of Comfort, and the God of Comfort.</i></p>

<p>1. Comfort ye, comfort ye my people, saith
your God. 2.&nbsp;Speak ye to the heart of Jerusalem,
and cry unto her, that her affliction is
ended, that her debt is paid, that she has
received from the hand of Jehovah double
for all her sins.</p>

<p>3. Hark, a crier! In the wilderness prepare
ye a way for Jehovah, make smooth in the
<span class="pagenum" id="pA45R">[p.&nbsp;A45R]</span>
desert a road for our God. 4.&nbsp;Let every
valley be exalted, and every mountain and
hill made low; and let the rugged by made a
plain, and the ledges of rock a valley.
5.&nbsp;And the glory of the Lord will be revealed,
and all flesh seeth together; for the mouth of
Jehovah hath spoken it.</p>

<p>6. Hark, one speaking, Cry! And he answers,
What shall I cry? All flesh is grass,
and all its beauty as the flower of the field.
7.&nbsp;Grass is withered, flower faded, for the
breath of Jehovah has blown upon it. Surely
grass is the people; 8.&nbsp;grass withereth, flower
fadeth: yet the word of our God shall stand
for ever.</p>

<p>9. Upon a high mountain get thee up, O
evangelistess <span class="wsnw">Zion;<a id="i40_fna1" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#i40_fn1">[1]</a></span>
lift up thy voice with
strength, evangelistess Jerusalem! lift up, be
not afraid; say to the cities of Judah, Behold
your God.</p>

<p>10. Behold, the Lord Jehovah as a mighty
one will He come! His arm ruling for Him;
behold, His reward is with Him, and His
retribution before Him. 11.&nbsp;He will feed
His flock like a shepherd, take the lambs in
His arm, and carry them in his bosom, and
gently lead those that are giving suck.</p>

<p>12. Who hath measured the waters with
the hollow of His hand, and regulated the
heavens with a span, and taken up the dust
of the earth in a third measure, and weighed
the mountains with a steelyard, and hills
with balances? 13.&nbsp;Who regulated the Spirit
of Jehovah, and (who) instructed Him as His
counsellor? 14.&nbsp;With whom took He counsel,
and who would have explained to Him and
instructed Him concerning the path of right,
and taught Him knowledge, and made known
to Him a prudent course?</p>

<p>15. Behold, nations like a little drop on a
bucket, and like a grain of sand in a balance,
are they esteemed; behold, islands like an
atom of dust that rises in the air. 16.&nbsp;And
Lebanon is not a sufficiency of burning, nor
its game a sufficiency of burnt-offerings.
17.&nbsp;All the nations are as nothing before Him;
they are regarded by Him as belonging to
nullity and emptiness. 18.&nbsp;And to whom
can ye liken God, and what king of image
can ye place beside Him!</p>

<p>19. The idol, when the smith has cast it,
the melter plates it with gold, and melteth
silver chains for it. 20.&nbsp;The man who is
impoverished in oblations, he chooseth a block
of wood that will not rot; he seeketh for himself
a skilful smith, to prepare an idol that
will not shake.</p>

<p>21. Do ye not know? Do ye not hear? Is it
not proclaimed to you from the beginning?
Have ye not obtained an insight into the
foundations of the earth? 22.&nbsp;He who is
enthroned above the vault of the earth, and
<span class="pagenum" id="pA46R">[p.&nbsp;A46R]</span>
its inhabitants resemble grasshoppers; who
has spread out the heavens like gauze, and
stretched them out like a tent-roof to dwell
in; 23.&nbsp;He who giveth up rulers; maketh
judges of the earth like a desolation.
24.&nbsp;They are hardly planted, hardly sown, their
stem has hardly taken root in the earth, and
He only blows upon them, and they dry up,
and the storm carries them away like stubble.</p>

<p>25. And to whom will ye compare Me, to
whom can I be equal? saith the Holy One.</p>

<p>26. <span class="wsnw">Lift<a id="i40_fna2" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#i40_fn2">[2]</a></span>
up your eyes on high and see;
who hath created these things? It is He
who bringeth out their host by number,
calleth them all by names, because of the
greatness of (His) might, and as being strong
in power: there is not one that is missing.</p>

<p>27. Why sayest thou, O Jacob, and speakest,
O Israel, My way is hidden from Jehovah,
and my right hand is overlooked by my God?
28.&nbsp;Is it not known to thee, or hast thou not
heard, an eternal God is Jehovah, Creator of
the ends of the earth? He fainteth not,
neither becomes weary; His understanding is
unsearchable. 29.&nbsp;Giving power to the faint,
and to the incapable He giveth strength in
abundance. 30.&nbsp;And youths grow faint and
weary, and young men suffer a fall.
31.&nbsp;But they who wait for Jehovah gain fresh
strength; lift up their wings like eagles;
run, and are not weary; go forward, and do
not faint.</p>

open streams upon hills of the field, and
springs in the midst of valleys; I make the
desert into a pond, and dry land into fountains
of water. 19.&nbsp;I give in the desert
cedars, acacias, and myrtles, and oleasters; I
set on the steppe cypresses, plane-trees, sherbin-trees

22.&nbsp;And yet it is a people robbed and
plundered; fastened in holes all of them, and

waters; 17.&nbsp;who bringeth out chariot
and horse, <span class="wsnw">army<a id="i43_fna2" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#i43_fn2">[2]</a></span>
and hero; they lie down
together, they never rise: they have flickered
away, extinguished like a wick. 18.&nbsp;Remember
not things of olden time, nor meditate
upon those of earlier times! 19.&nbsp;Behold, I
work out a new thing; will ye not live to see
it? Yea, I make a road through the desert,
and streams through solitudies. 20.&nbsp;The beast
of the field will praise Me, wild dogs and
ostriches; for I give water in the desert,
streams in solitude, to give drink to My people,
My chosen. 21.&nbsp;The people that I formed
for Myself, they shall show forth My praise.</p>

<p>22.<a id="i43_fna3" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#i43_fn3">[3]</a> And thou hast not called upon Me, O
Jacob, that thou shouldest have wearied thyself
for Me, O Israel! 23.&nbsp;Thou hast not
brought Me sheep of My burnt-offerings, and
thou hast not honoured Me with thy slain-offerings.
I have not burdened thee with
meat-offerings, and have not troubled thee
about incense. 24.&nbsp;Thou hast brought Me no
spice-cane for silver, nor hast thou refreshed
Me with the fat of thy slain-offerings. No;
thou hast wearied Me with thy sins, troubled
Me with thine iniquities. 25.&nbsp;I, I alone, blot
out thy transgressions for My own sake, and
do not remember thy sins.</p>

<p>26. Call to My remembrance; we will strive
together; tell Me now, that thou mayest appear
just. 27.&nbsp;Thy first forefather sinned, and
thy mediators have fallen away from Me.
28.&nbsp;Then I profaned holy princes, and gave up
Jacob to the curse, and Israel to blasphemies.</p>

He gets hungry thereby, and his strength

13.&nbsp;The carpenter draws the line,
marks it with the pencil, carries it out with

15.&nbsp;And it serves the man for firing; he takes
thereof, and warms himself; he also heats,

of it, and falls down before it. 16.&nbsp;The half

satisfied; he also warms himself, and says,
Hurrah! I am getting warm, I feel the heat.

his right hand to subdue nations before him,
and the loins of kings I ungird, to open before
him doors and gates, that they may not
continue shut. 2.&nbsp;I shall go before thee, and
level what is heaped up: gates of brass shall
I break to pieces, and bolts of iron shall I
smite to the ground. 3.&nbsp;And I shall give
thee treasures of darkness, and jewels of hidden
places, that thou mayest know that I
Jehovah am He who called out thy name,
(even) the God of Israel.</p>

<p>4. For the sake of My servant Jacob, and
Israel My chosen, I called thee hither by
name, surnamed thee when thou knewest Me
not. 5.&nbsp;I Jehovah, and there is none else,
beside Me no God: I equipped thee when
thou knewest Me not; 6.&nbsp;that they may
know from the rising of the sun, and its
going down, that there is none without Me;
I Jehovah, and there is none else; 7.&nbsp;Former
of the light, and Creator of the darkness;
Founder of peace, and Creator of evil: I Jehovah
am He Who worketh all this.</p>

<p>8. Cause to trickle down, ye heavens above,
and let the blue sky rain down righteousness;
let the earth open, and let salvation blossom,
and righteousness; let them sprout together,
I Jehovah have created it.</p>

<p>9. Woe to him that quarreleth with his
Maker&mdash;a pot among the pots of earthenware!
Can the clay indeed say to him that
shapeth it, What makest thou? and thy work,
He hath no hands? 10.&nbsp;Woe to him that
saith to his father, What begettest thou? and
to the woman, What bringest thou forth?</p>

<p>11. Thus saith Jehovah, the Holy One of
Israel, and its Maker, Ask Me what is to
come; let My sons and the work of My hands
be committed to Me! 12.&nbsp;I, I have made the
earth, and created men upon it; I, My hands
have stretched out the heavens, and all their
host have I called forth. 13.&nbsp;I, I have raised
him up in righteousness, and all his ways
<span class="pagenum" id="pA55R">[p.&nbsp;A55R]</span>
shall I make smooth: he will build My city,
and release My banished ones, not for price
nor for reward, saith Jehovah of hosts.</p>

<p>14. Thus saith Jehovah, The productions of
Egypt, and gain of Ethiopia, and the Sabeans,
men of tall stature, will come over to thee,
and belong to thee; they will come after
thee; in chains they will come over, and cast
themselves down to thee; they pray to thee,
Surely God is in thee, and there is none else;
no Deity at all.</p>

<p>15. Verily Thou art a mysterious God,
Thou God of Israel, Thou Saviour.</p>

<p>16. They are put to shame, and also confounded,
all of them; they go away into
confusion together, the forgers of idols.
17.&nbsp;Israel is redeemed by Jehovah with everlasting
redemption; ye are not put to shame nor
confounded to everlasting eternities.</p>

<p>18. For thus saith Jehovah, the Creator
of the heavens (He is the Deity), the Former
of the earth, and its Finisher; He has established
it, He has not created it a desert, He
has formed it to be inhabited; I am Jehovah,
and there is none else. 19.&nbsp;I have not
spoken in secret, in a place of the land of
darkness; I did not say to the seed of Jacob,
Into the desert seek ye me! I Jehovah am
speaking righteousness, proclaiming upright
things.</p>

<p>20. Assemble yourselves and come; draw
near together, ye escaped of the heathen!
Irrational are they who burden themselves
with the wood of their idol, and pray to a god
that bringeth no salvation. 21.&nbsp;Make known,
and cause to draw near; yes, let them take
counsel together: Who has made such things
known from the olden time, proclaimed it
long ago? have not I, Jehovah? and there is
no Deity beside Me;  God just, and bringing
salvation; there is none without Me!</p>

<p>22. Turn unto Me, and be ye saved, all ye
ends of the earth; for I am God, and none
else. 23.&nbsp;By Myself have I sworn, a word
has gone out of My mouth of righteousness,
and will not return, That to Me every knee

hear it, that thou mightest not say, My idol
has done it, and my graven image and molten
image commanded it. 6.&nbsp;Thou hast heard it,
look then at it all; and ye, must ye not confess
it? I give thee new things to hear from
this time forth, and hidden things, and what
thou didst not know. 7.&nbsp;It is created now, and
not long ago; and thou hast not heard it before;
that thou mightest not say, Behold, I
<span class="pagenum" id="pA59R">[p.&nbsp;A59R]</span>
knew it. 8.&nbsp;Thou hast neither heard it, nor
known it, nor did thine ear open itself to it
long ago; for I knew thou art altogether
faithless, and thou art called rebellious from
the womb. 9.&nbsp;For My name&rsquo;s sake I lengthen
out My wrath, and for My praise I hold back
towards thee, that I may not cut thee off.
10.&nbsp;Behold, I have refined thee, and not in the
manner of silver; I have proved thee in the
furnace of affliction. 11.&nbsp;For Mine own sake,
for Mine own sake I accomplish it (for <span class="wsnw">how<a id="i48_fna1" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#i48_fn1">[1]</a></span>
it is profaned!) and My glory I give not to
another.</p>

<p>12. Hearken to me, O Jacob, and Israel
my called! I am it; I first, also I last.
13.&nbsp;My hand also hath laid the foundation of the
earth, and my right hand hath spanned the
heavens: I call to them, and they stand there
together. 14.&nbsp;All ye, assemble yourselves,
and hear: Who among you hath proclaimed
this? He who Jehovah loveth will accomplish
His will upon Babel, and His arm upon
the Chaldeans. 15.&nbsp;I, I have spoken, have
also called him, have brought him here, and
his way prospers. 16.&nbsp;Come ye near to Me!
Hear ye this! I have not spoken in secret;
from the beginning from the time that it
takes place, there am I: and now the Lord
Jehovah hath sent Me and His Spirit.</p>

<p>17. Thus saith Jehovah, thy Redeemer, the
Holy One of Israel; I, Jehovah thy God, am
He that teacheth thee to do that which profiteth,
and leadest thee by the way that thou
shouldest go. <span class="wsnw">18. Oh<a id="i48_fna2" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#i48_fn2">[2]</a></span>
that thou hadst hearkened
to My commandments! then thy peace
becomes like the river, and thy righteousness
like waves of the sea; 19.&nbsp;and thy seed like
the sand, and the children of thy body like the
grains thereof; its name will not be cut off
nor destroyed away from My countenance.</p>

<p>20. Go out of Babel, flee from Chaldea
with voice of shouting: declare ye, preach ye
this, carry it out to the end of the earth! Say
ye, Jehovah hath redeemed Jacob His servant.
21.&nbsp;And they thirsted not: He led them
through dry places; He caused water to trickle
out of rocks for them; He split rocks, and
waters gushed out. 22.&nbsp;There is no peace,
saith Jehovah, for the wicked.</p>

<p class="tdc"><i>Self-Attestation of the Servant of Jehovah. The
Despondency of Zion Reproved.</i></p>

<p>1. Listen, O isles, unto Me; and hearken,
ye nations afar off: Jehovah hath called Me
from the womb; from My mother&rsquo;s lap hath
He remembered My name. 2.&nbsp;And He made
My mouth like a sharp sword; in the shadow
of His hand hath He hid Me, and made Me
a polished shaft; in His quiver hath He concealed
Me. 3.&nbsp;And He said to Me, Thou art
My servant, O Israel, Thou in Whom I glorify
Myself.</p>

<p>4. And I, I said, I have wearied Myself in
vain, and thrown away My strength for nothing
and to no purpose; yet My <span class="wsnw">right<a id="i49_fna1" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#i49_fn1">[1]</a></span> is
with Jehovah, and My reward with My God.</p>

<p>5. And now, saith Jehovah, that formed
Me from the womb to be His servant, to
bring back Jacob to Him, and that <span class="wsnw">Israel<a id="i49_fna2" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#i49_fn2">[2]</a></span>
may be gathered together to Him; and I am
honoured in the eyes of Jehovah, and My
God has become My strength. 6.&nbsp;He saith,
It is only a small thing that Thou becomest
My servant, to set up the tribes of Jacob, and
to bring back the preserved of Israel: I have
set Thee for the light of the Gentiles, to
become My salvation to the end of the earth.</p>

<p>7. Thus saith Jehovah, the Redeemer of
Israel, His Holy One, to him of contemptible
soul, to the abhorrence of the people, to the
servant of tyrants: Kings shall see and arise;
princes, and prostrate themselves for the sake
of Jehovah, who is faithful, the Holy One
of Israel, that He hath chosen Thee. 8.&nbsp;Thus
saith Jehovah, <span class="wsnw">In<a id="i49_fna3" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#i49_fn3">[3]</a></span>
a time of favour I have
heard Thee, and in the day of salvation have
I helped Thee: and I form Thee, and set Thee
for a covenant of the people, to raise up the
land, to apportion again desolate inheritances,
9. saying to prisoners: Go ye out; to those
who are in darkness, Come ye to the light.</p>

<p>They shall feed by the ways, <span class="wsnw">and<a id="i49_fna4" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#i49_fn4">[4]</a></span> there
is pasture for them upon all field-hills.
10.&nbsp;They shall not hunger nor thirst, and the
mirage and sun shall not blind them: for He
that hath mercy on them shall lead them, and
guide them by bubbling water-springs.
11.&nbsp;And I make all My mountains ways, and My
<span class="pagenum" id="pA61R">[p.&nbsp;A61R]</span>
roads are exalted. 12.&nbsp;Behold these, they
come from afar; and behold these from the
north and from the sea; and these from the
land of the Sinese. 13.&nbsp;Sing, O heavens,
and shout, O earth; and break out into singing,
ye mountains! for Jehovah hath comforted
His people, and He hath compassion
upon His afflicted ones.</p>

<p>14. Zion said, Jehovah hath forsaken me,
and the Lord hath forgotten me. 15.&nbsp;Does
a woman forget her sucking child, so as not
to have compassion upon the child of her
womb? Even though mothers should forget,
I will not forget thee. 16.&nbsp;Behold, I have
graven thee upon the palms of My hands;
thy walls stand continually before Me.</p>

<p>17. Thy children make haste, thy destroyers
and masters draw out from thee.
18.&nbsp;Lift up thine eyes round about, and see;
all these assemble themselves together, and
come to thee. As truly as I live, saith
Jehovah, thou wilt put them all on like
jewellery, and gird them about thee like a
bride. 19.&nbsp;For thy ruins and thy waste
places and thy land full of ruin,--yea, now
thou wilt be too narrow for the inhabitants,
and thy devourers are far away. <span class="wnsw">20. Thy<a id="i49_fna5" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#i49_fn5">[5]</a></span>
children, that were formerly taken from thee,
shall say in thine ears, The space is too
narrow for me; give way for me, that I may
have room. 21.&nbsp;And thou wilt say in thy
heart, Who hath borne me these, seeing I
am robbed of children, and barren, banished,
and thrust away; and these, who hath brought
them up? Behold, I was left alone; these,
where were they?</p>

<p>22. Thus saith the Lord Jehovah, Behold,
I lift up My hand to nations, and set up My
standard to peoples: and they bring thy sons
in their bosom; and thy daughters, upon
shoulders are they carried. 23.&nbsp;And kings
become thy foster-fathers, and their princesses
thy nurses: they bow down their face to thee
to the earth, and they lick the dust of thy
feet; and thou shalt learn that I am Jehovah,
He whose hoping ones are not put to shame.</p>

<p>24. Can the booty indeed be wrested from
a giant, or will the <span class="wsnw">captive<a id="i49_fna6" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#i49_fn6">[6]</a></span> host of the righteous
escape? 25.&nbsp;Yea, thus saith Jehovah,
Even the captive hosts of a giant are wrested
from him, and the booty of a tyrant escapes!
and <span class="wsnw">I<a id="i49_fna7" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#i49_fn7">[7]</a></span>

away? Or where is one of My creditors, to
whom I sold you? <span class="wsnw">Behold,<a id="i50_fna1" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#i50_fn1">[1]</a></span> for your iniquities
are ye sold, and for your transgressions is
your mother put away.</p>

<p>2. Why did I come, and there was no one
there? Why did I call, and there was no one
who answered? Is My hand too short to redeem?
Or is there no strength in Me to deliver?
Behold, through My threatening I dry
up the sea; turn streams into a plain: their
fish rot because there is no water, and die for
thirst. 3.&nbsp;I clothe the heavens in mourning,
and make sackcloth their covering.</p>

<p>4. The Lord Jehovah hath given Me a disciple&rsquo;s
tongue, that I may know how to set up
the wearied with words: He wakeneth every
morning; wakeneth Mine ear to attend in a
disciple&rsquo;s manner. 5.&nbsp;The Lord Jehovah hath
opened Mine ear; and I, I was not rebellious,
and did not turn back. 6.&nbsp;I offered My back
to smiters, and My cheeks to them that pluck
off the hair; I hid not My face from shame
and spitting. 7.&nbsp;But the Lord Jehovah will
help Me; therefore have I not suffered Myself
to be overcome by mockery: therefore did I
make My face like the flint, and knew that I
should not be put to shame. 8.&nbsp;He is near
that justifieth Me; who will contend with Me?
We will draw near together! Let him draw near to
Me! 9.&nbsp;Behold, the Lord Jehovah will help
Me; who is he that could condemn Me? Behold,
they shall all fall to pieces like a garment;
the moth shall eat them up.</p>

to the rock whence ye are hewn, and to the
hollow of the pit whence ye are dug. 2.&nbsp;Look
who bare you, that he was one when I called
him, and blessed him, and multiplied him.
3.&nbsp;For Jehovah hath comforted Zion, comforted
all her ruins, and turned her desert like
Eden, and her steppe as the garden of God;
joy and gladness are found in her, thanksgiving
and sounding music.</p>

<p>4. Hearken unto Me, My people, and give
ear unto Me, O My congregation! for instruction
will go forth from Me, and I make a
place for My right, to be a light of the nations.
5.&nbsp;My salvation is near, My salvation is drawn
out, and My arms will judge nations: the hoping
of the islands looks to Me, and for Mine
arm is their waiting. 6.&nbsp;Lift up your eyes to
the heavens, and look upon the earth beneath:
for the heavens will pass away like smoke,
and the earth fall to pieces like a garment,
<span class="wsnw">and<a id="i51_fna1" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#i51_fn1">[1]</a></span> its inhabitants die out like a nonentity;

<p>7. Hearken unto Me, ye that know about
righteousness, thou people with My law in the
heart; fear ye not the reproach of mortals,
and be ye not alarmed at their revilings.
8.&nbsp;For the moth will devour them like a garment,
and the worm devour them like woollen cloth;
and My righteousness shall stand for ever, and
My salvation to distant generations.</p>

<p>9. Awake, awake, clothe thyself in might,
O arm of Jehovah; awake, as in the days of
ancient time, the ages of the olden world!
Was it not Thou that didst split Rahab in
pieces, and pierced the dragon? 10.&nbsp;Was it
not Thou that didst dry up the sea, the waters

through? <span class="wsnw">11. And<a id="i51_fna2" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#i51_fn2">[2]</a></span> the emancipated of Jehovah

<span class="pagenum" id="pA64R">[p.&nbsp;A64R]</span>
that thou shouldest be afraid of a man who
will die, and of a son of man who is made a
blade of grass; 13.&nbsp;that thou shouldest forget
Jehovah thy Creator, who stretched out the
heavens and founded the earth; that thou
shouldest be afraid continually all the day of
the fury of the tormentor, as he aims to destroy?
and where is the fury of the tormentor
left? <span class="wsnw">14. He<a id="i51_fna3" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#i51_fn3">[3]</a></span> that is bowed down is quickly

Jehovah am thy God, who frighteneth up the
sea, so that its waves roar; Jehovah of hosts
is His name. 16.&nbsp;And I put My words into
thy mouth, and in the shadow of My hand
have I covered thee, to plant heavens, and to
found on earth, and to say to Zion, Thou art
My people.</p>

<p>17. Wake thyself up, stand up, O Jerusalem;
thou that hast drunk out of the hand of Jehovah
the goblet of His fury; the goblet-cup
of reeling hast thou drunk, sipped out.
18.&nbsp;There was none who guided her of all the

20.&nbsp;Thy children were benighted, lay at the corners

the rebuke of thy God. 21.&nbsp;Therefore hearken
to this, O wretched and drunken, but not with

thy God that defendeth His people, Behold, I
take out of thy hand the goblet-cup of My
fury: thou shalt not continue to drink it any
more. 23.&nbsp;And I put it into the hand of thy
tormentors; who said to thy soul, Bow down,

was despised and forsaken by men; a man of
griefs, and well acquainted with disease; and
like one from whom men hide their face: despised,
and we esteemed Him not.</p>

<p>4. Verily He hath borne our diseases and
our pains! He hath laden them upon Himself;
but we regarded Him as one stricken,
smitten of God, and afflicted. 5.&nbsp;Whereas He
was pierced for our sins, bruised for our iniquities!
the punishment was laid on Him
for our peace; and through His stripes we
were healed. 6.&nbsp;All we like sheep went
astray; we had turned every one to his own
way; and Jehovah caused the iniquity of us
all to fall on Him.</p>

<p>7. <span class="wsnw">He<a id="i53_fna1" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#i53_fn1">[1]</a></span> was ill-treated; whilst He suffered
willingly, and opened not His mouth, like the
sheep that is led to the slaughter-bench, and
like a lamb that is dumb before its shearers,
and opened not His mouth. <span class="wnsw">8. He<a id="i53_fna2" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#i53_fn2">[2]</a></span> has been
taken away from prison and judgment;
and of His generation who considered: &ldquo;He
was snatched away out of the land of the living;
for the wickedness of my people punishment
fell on Him&rdquo;? 9.&nbsp;And they assigned
Him His grave with sinners, and with a rich
man in His martyrdom, because He had done
no wrong, and there was no deceit in His
mouth.</p>

<p>10. And it pleased Jehovah to bruise Him,
to afflict Him with disease; if His soul would
pay a trespass-offering, He should see posterity,
should live long days, and the purpose
of Jehovah should prosper through His hand.
11.&nbsp;Because of the travail of His soul, He will
see, and be refreshed; through His knowledge
<span class="pagenum" id="pA68R">[p.&nbsp;A68R]</span>
will He procure justice, My Righteous Servant,
for the many, and will take their iniquities
upon Himself. 12.&nbsp;Therefore I give Him a
portion among the great, and with strong
ones will He divide the spoil; because He has
poured out His soul into death: and He let
Himself be reckoned among transgressors;
whilst He bare the sin of many, and made intercession
for the transgressors.</p>

2.&nbsp;Enlarge the space of thy tent, and

Noah should not overflow the earth any more;

come, and My righteousness to reveal itself.
2.&nbsp;Blessed is the mortal that doeth this, and
the son of man that layeth fast hold thereon;
who keepeth the Sabbath, that he doth not

any kind of evil.</p>

3. And let not the foreigner, who hath

only a dry tree. 4.&nbsp;For thus saith Jehovah
to the eunuchs, Those who keep My Sabbaths,
and decide for that in which I take
pleasure, and take fast hold of My covenant,
5.&nbsp;I give to them in My house and within My
walls a <span class="wsnw">memorial<a id="i56_fna1" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#i56_fn1">[1]</a></span> and a name better than sons

6.&nbsp;And the foreigners, who have joined themselves
to Jehovah, to serve Him, and to love
the name of Jehovah, to be His servants, whoever
keepeth the Sabbath from desecrating it,
and those who hold fast to My covenant;
7.&nbsp;I bring them to My holy mountain, and make
them joyful in My house of prayer; their
whole-offerings and their slain-offerings are
well-pleasing upon Mine altar; for My house,

<p>Am I not silent, and that for a long time,

<p class="tdc"><i>The Existing Wall of Partition Broken
Down at Last.</i></p>

<p>1. Behold, Jehovah&rsquo;s hand is not too short
to help, nor His ear too heavy to hear;
<span class="pagenum" id="pA76R">[p.&nbsp;A76R]</span>
2.&nbsp;but your iniquities have become a party-wall
between you and your God and your sins
have hidden His face from you, so that He
does not hear. 3.&nbsp;For your hands are defiled
with blood, and your fingers with iniquity;
your lips speak lies, your tongue murmurs
wickedness.</p>

<p>4. No one speaks with justice, and no
one pleads with faithfulness; men trust in
vanity, and speak with <span class="wsnw">deception;<a id="i59_fna1" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#i59_fn1">[1]</a></span> they conceive
trouble, and bring forth ruin. 5.&nbsp;They
hatch basilisks&rsquo; eggs, and weave spiders&rsquo;
webs. He that eateth of their eggs must die;
and if one is trodden upon, it splits into
an adder. 6.&nbsp;Their webs do not suffice for
<span class="wsnw">clothing,<a id="i59_fna2" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#i59_fn2">[2]</a></span> and men cannot cover themselves
with their works: their works are works of
ruin, and the practice of injustice is in their
hands. 7.&nbsp;Their feet run to evil, and make
haste to shed innocent blood: their thoughts
are thoughts of wickedness; wasting and
destruction are in their paths. 8.&nbsp;The way of
peace they know not, and there is no right in
their roads: they make their paths crooked:
every one who treads upon them knows no peace.</p>

<p>9. Therefore right remains far from us,
and righteousness does not overtake us;
we hope for light, and behold darkness; for
brightness&mdash;we walk in thick darkness.
10.&nbsp;We grope along the wall like the blind, and
like eyeless men we grope: we stumble in the
light of noon-day as in the darkness, and
among the living like the <span class="wsnw">dead.<a id="i59_fna3" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#i59_fn3">[3]</a></span>
11.&nbsp;We
roar all like bears, and moan deeply like
doves; we hope for right, and it cometh
not; for salvation&mdash;it remaineth far from
us.</p>

<p>12. For our transgressions are many before
Thee, and our sins testify against us; for our
transgressions are known to us, and our evil
deeds well known: 13.&nbsp;apostasy and denial
of Jehovah, and turning back from following
our God, oppressive and false <span class="wsnw">speaking,<a id="i59_fna4" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#i59_fn4">[4]</a></span> conceiving
and giving out from the heart words
of falsehood. 14.&nbsp;And right is forced back,
and righteousness stands afar off; for truth is
fallen in the market-<span class="wsnw">place,<a id="i59_fna5" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#i59_fn5">[5]</a></span> and honesty finds
no admission. 15.&nbsp;And truth became missing,
and he who avoids evil is outlawed.</p>

<p>And Jehovah saw it, and it was displeasing in
His eyes, that there was no right. 16.&nbsp;And He
saw that there was not a man anywhere, and
was astonished that there was nowhere an intercessor:
then His arm brought Him help
and His righteousness became His stay.
17.&nbsp;And He put on righteousness as a coat of
mail, and the helmet of salvation upon His
<span class="pagenum" id="pA77R">[p.&nbsp;A77R]</span>
head; and put on garments of vengeance as
armour, and clothed Himself in zeal as in a
cloak. 18.&nbsp;According to the deeds, accordingly
He will repay; burning wrath to His
adversaries, punishment to His foes; the
islands He will repay with <span class="wsnw">chastisement.<a id="i59_fna6" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#i59_fn6">[6]</a></span></p>

<p>19. And they will fear the name of Jehovah
from the west, and His glory from the rising
of the sun: for He will come like a stream
dammed up, which a tempest of Jehovah drives
<span class="wsnw">away.<a id="i59_fna7" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#i59_fn7">[7]</a></span>
20.&nbsp;And a Redeemer comes from Zion,
and for those who turn from apostasy in Jacob,
saith Jehovah.</p>

<p>21. And I, this is My covenant with them,
saith Jehovah: My Spirit which is upon thee,
and My word which I have put in thy mouth,
shall not depart out of thy mouth, and out
of the mouth of thy seed, and out of the mouth
of thy seed&rsquo;s seed, saith Jehovah, from henceforth
and for ever.</p>

<p class="tdc"><i>The Glory of the Jerusalem of the Last Days.</i></p>

<p>1. Arise, grow light: for thy light cometh,
and the glory of Jehovah riseth upon thee.
2.&nbsp;For, behold, the darkness covereth the
earth, and deep darkness the nations; and
Jehovah riseth over thee, and His glory becomes
<span class="pagenum" id="pA78R">[p.&nbsp;A78R]</span>
visible over thee. 3.&nbsp;And nations walk
to thy light, and kings to the shining of thy
rays.</p>

<p>4. Lift up thine eyes round about, and
see: they all crowd together, they come to
thee: thy sons come from afar, and thy
daughters are carried hither upon arms.
5.&nbsp;Then wilt thou see and <span class="wsnw">shine,<a id="i60_fna1" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#i60_fn1">[1]</a></span> and thine heart
will tremble and expand; for the abundance
of the nations cometh to thee. 6.&nbsp;A swarm
of camels will cover thee, the foals of Midian
and Ephah; they come all together from Saba;
fully make known the praises of Jehovah.
7.&nbsp;All the flocks of Kedar gather together
unto thee, the rams of Nabaioth will serve
thee; they will come up with acceptance upon
Mine altar, and I will adorn the house of My
adorning. 8.&nbsp;Who are these who fly hither as
a cloud, and like the doves to their windows?
9.&nbsp;Yea, the islands wait for Me; and the
ships of Tarshish come first, to bring thy
children from far, their silver and their gold
with them, to the name of thy God, and to
the Holy One of Israel, because He hath ornamented
thee.</p>

<p>10. And the sons of strangers build thy walls,
and their kings serve thee; for in My
wrath I have smitten thee, and in My
favour I have had mercy upon thee.
11.&nbsp;And thy gates remain open continually day
and night, they shall not be shut, to bring
into thee the possessions of the nations, and
their kings in <span class="wsnw">triumph.<a id="i60_fna2" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#i60_fn2">[2]</a></span> 12.&nbsp;For the nation
and the kingdom which will not serve thee
will perish, and the nations be certainly laid
waste. 13.&nbsp;The glory of Lebanon will come
to thee, cypresses, plane-trees, and sherbin-trees,
all together, to beautify the place of My
sanctuary, and to make the place of My feet
glorious. 14.&nbsp;The children also of thy tormentors
come bending unto thee, and all thy
despisers stretch themselves at the soles of thy
feet, and call thee City of Jehovah, Zion of
the Holy One of Israel.</p>

<p>15. Whereas thou wast forsaken and
hated, and no one walked through thee,
I make thee now into eternal splendour, a
rapture from generation to generation.
16.&nbsp;And thou suckest the milk of nations,
and the breast of kings thou wilt suck, and
learn that I Jehovah am thy Saviour and thy
Redeemer, the Mighty One of Jacob. 17.&nbsp;For
copper I bring gold, and for iron I bring
silver, and for wood copper, and for stones
iron, and to make peace thy magistracy, and
righteousness thy <span class="wsnw">bailiffs.<a id="i60_fna3" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#i60_fn3">[3]</a></span> 18.&nbsp;Injustice is no
more seen in thy land, wasting and destruction
in thy borders; and thou callest salvation
thy walls, and renown thy gates.</p>

<p>19. The sun will be no more thy light by
day, neither for brightness will the moon
<span class="pagenum" id="pA79R">[p.&nbsp;A79R]</span>
shine upon thee: Jehovah will be to thee
an everlasting light, and thy God thy
glory. 20.&nbsp;Thy sun will no more go down and
thy moon will not be withdrawn: for Jehovah
will be to thee an everlasting light, and the
days of thy mourning will be finished.
21.&nbsp;And thy people, they are all righteous; they
possess the land for a sprout of My plantations,
a work of My hands for glorification.
22.&nbsp;The smallest one will become thousands,
and the meanest one a powerful nation.</p>

<p>I, Jehovah, will hasten it in His time.</p>

shall be joyful in my God, that He hath given
me garments of salvation to put on, hath
wrapped me in the robe of righteousness, as

the praises of <span class="wsnw">Jehovah,<a id="i63_fna2" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#i63_fn2">[2]</a></span> as is seemly for all
that Jehovah hath shown us, and the great
goodness towards the house of Israel, which
He hath shown them according to His pity, and
the riches of His mercies. 8.&nbsp;He said, They
are my people, children who will not <span class="wsnw">lie;<a id="i63_fna3" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#i63_fn3">[3]</a></span>
and He became their Saviour. 9.&nbsp;In all their
affliction, He was <span class="wsnw">afflicted,<a id="i63_fna4" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#i63_fn4">[4]</a></span> and the Angel of
His face brought them salvation. In His love
and in His pity He redeemed them, and lifted
them up, and bare them all the days of the
olden time.</p>

<p>10. But they resisted and vexed His Holy
Spirit: then He turned to be their enemy;
He made war upon them. 11.&nbsp;Then His
people remembered the days of the olden
time, of Moses: Where is He who brought
them up out of the see with the shepherd of
His flock? Where is He who put the Spirit of
His holiness in the midst of them; 12.&nbsp;who
caused the arm of His majesty to go at the
right of Moses; who split the waters before
them, to make Himself an everlasting name;
13.&nbsp;who caused them to pass through abysses
of the deep, like the horse upon the plain,
without their stumbling? 14.&nbsp;Like the cattle
which goeth down into the valley, the Spirit
of Jehovah brought them to rest: thus hast
Thou led Thy people, to make Thyself a
majestic name.</p>

<p>15. Look from heaven and see, from the
habitation of Thy holiness and majesty!
Where is Thy zeal and Thy display of might?
The pressure of Thy bowels and Thy compassions
are restrained towards me. 16.&nbsp;For
Thou art our Father; for Abraham is ignorant
of us, and Israel knoweth us <span class="wsnw">not.<a id="i63_fna5" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#i63_fn5">[5]</a></span> Thou, O
Jehovah, art our Father; our Redeemer is
from olden time Thy name. 17.&nbsp;O Jehovah,
<span class="pagenum" id="pA83R">[p.&nbsp;A83R]</span>
why leadest Thou us astray from Thy ways,
hardenest our heart, so as not to fear Thee?
Return for Thy servants&rsquo; sake, the tribes
of Thine inheritance. 18.&nbsp;For a little time
Thy holy people was in possession. Our
adversaries have trodden down Thy sanctuary.
19.&nbsp;We have become such as He
who is from everlasting has not ruled over,
upon whom Thy name was not called.
LXIV.&mdash;1.&nbsp;O that Thou wouldst rend the
heavens, come down, the mountains would
shake before Thy countenance;&mdash;2.&nbsp;(wouldst
come down) as fire kindles brushwood, fire
causes water to boil; to make known Thy
name to Thine adversaries, that the heathen
may tremble before Thy face! 3.&nbsp;When Thou
doest terrible things which we hoped not for;
wouldst come down, (and) mountains shake
before Thy <span class="wsnw">countenance!<a id="i64_fna1" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#i64_fn1">[1]</a></span></p>

<p>4. For from olden times men have not heard,
nor perceived, nor hath an eye seen, a God
beside Thee, who acted on behalf of him that
waiteth for Him. 5.&nbsp;Thou didst meet him
that rejoiceth to work righteousness, when
they remembered Thee in Thy ways.</p>

<p>Behold, Thou, Thou art enraged, and we
stood as sinners there; already have we been
long in this state, and shall we be <span class="wsnw">saved?<a id="i64_fna2" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#i64_fn2">[2]</a></span>
6.&nbsp;We became like the unclean thing, and
all our virtues like a garment soiled with
blood; and we all faded away together like
the leaves; and our iniquities, like the storm,
they carried us away. 7.&nbsp;And there was no
one who called upon Thy name, who aroused
himself to lay firm hold of Thee: for Thou
hadst hidden Thy face from us, and didst melt
us into the hand of our <span class="wsnw">transgressions.<a id="i64_fna3" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#i64_fn3">[3]</a></span></p>

<p>8. And now, O Jehovah, Thou art our
Father: we are the clay, and Thou our <span class="wsnw">Maker;<a id="i64_fna4" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#i64_fn4">[4]</a></span>
and we are all the work of Thy hand.
9.&nbsp;Be not extremely angry, O Jehovah, and
remember not the transgression for ever!
Behold, consider, we beseech Thee, we are
Thy people.</p>

<p>10. The cities of Thy holiness have become
a pasture-ground; Zion has become a pasture-ground,
Jerusalem a desert. 11.&nbsp;The house
of our holiness and of our adorning, where
our fathers praised Thee, is given up to the
fire, and everything that was our delight given
up to devastation. 12.&nbsp;Wilt Thou restrain
<span class="pagenum" id="pA84R">[p.&nbsp;A84R]</span>
Thyself in spite of this, O Jehovah, be silent,
and leave us to suffer the utmost?</p>

<p class="tdc"><i>Jehovah&rsquo;s Answer to the Church&rsquo;s Prayer.</i></p>

<p>1. I was discernible to those who did not
inquire, discoverable by those who did not
seek <span class="wsnw">Me.<a id="i65_fna1" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#i65_fn1">[1]</a></span> I said, &ldquo;Here am I, Here am I,&rdquo;
to a nation where My name was not called.
2.&nbsp;I spread out My hands all the day to a
refractory people, who walked in the way
that was not good, after their own thoughts.
3.&nbsp;The people that continually provoketh Me
by defying Me to My face, sacrificing in the
gardens, and burning incense upon the tiles;
4.&nbsp;who sit in the graves, and spend the
night in closed places; to eat the flesh of
swine, and broken pieces of abominations is
in their dishes; 5.&nbsp;who say, Stop! come not
too near Me; for I am holy to thee; they are
a smoke in My nose, a fire blazing continually.</p>

<p>6. Behold, it is written before Me: I
will not keep silence without having recompensed,
and I will recompense into their
bosom. 7.&nbsp;Your offences, and the offences
of your fathers together, saith Jehovah, that
they have burned incense upon the mountains,
and insulted Me upon the hills, and
I measure their reward first of all into their
bosom.</p>

<p>8. Thus saith Jehovah, As when the must is
found in the cluster, men say, Do not destroy
it, for there is a blessing within it, so will I do
for the sake of My servants, that I may not
destroy the whole. 9.&nbsp;And I will bring forth
a seed out of Jacob, and an heir of My mountains
out of Judah, and My chosen ones shall
inherit it, and My servants shall dwell there.
10.&nbsp;And the plain of Sharon becomes a meadow
for flocks, and the valley of Achor a resting-place
for oxen, for My people that asketh
for Me.</p>

<p>11. And ye, who are enemies to Jehovah,
O ye that are unmindful of My holy mountain,
<span class="pagenum" id="pA85R">[p.&nbsp;A85R]</span>
who prepare a table for Gad, and fill
up mixed drink for the goddess of destiny,--12.&nbsp;I
have destined you to the sword, and
ye will bow down to the slaughter, because I
have called, and ye have not replied, I have
spoken, and ye have not heard; and ye did
evil in Mine eyes, and ye chose that which I
did not like.</p>

<p>13. Therefore thus saith the Lord, Jehovah:
Behold My servants will eat, but ye will hunger;
behold My servants will drink, but ye
will thirst; behold My servants will rejoice,
but ye will be put to shame; 14.&nbsp;behold My
servants will exult for delight of heart, but
ye will cry for anguish of heart, and ye will
lament for brokenness of spirit. 15.&nbsp;And ye
will leave your name for a curse to My chosen
ones, and the Lord, Jehovah, will slay thee;
by His servants He will call by another
name, 16.&nbsp;so that whosoever blesseth himself
in them and will bless himself by the God of
<span class="wsnw">truthfulness,<a id="i65_fna2" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#i65_fn2">[2]</a></span> and whosoever sweareth in the
land will swear by the God of <span class="wsnw">truthfulness,<a id="i65_fna3" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#i65_fn3">[3]</a></span>
because the former troubles are forgotten, and
because they have vanished from Mine eyes.</p>

<p>17. For behold I create a new heaven and
a new earth; and men will not remember the
first, nor do they come to any one&rsquo;s mind.
18.&nbsp;No, be ye joyful and exult for ever at
that which I create; for behold I turn Jerusalem
into exulting, and her people into joy.
19.&nbsp;And I shall exult over Jerusalem, and
be joyous over My people, and the voice of
weeping and screaming will be heard in her
no more. 20.&nbsp;And there shall be no more come
thence a suckling of a few days, and an old
man who has not lived out all his days; for
the youth in it will die as one a hundred
years old, and the sinner be smitten with a
curse as one a hundred years <span class="wsnw">old.<a id="i65_fna4" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#i65_fn4">[4]</a></span></p>

<p>21. And they will build houses and inhabit
them, and plant vineyards and enjoy the fruit
thereof. 22.&nbsp;They will not build and another
inhabit, nor plant and another enjoy; for like
the days of trees are the days of My people,
and My chosen ones will consume the work of
their hands. 23.&nbsp;They will not weary themselves
in vain, nor bring forth for sudden
disaster; for they are a family of the blessed of
Jehovah, and their offspring are left to them.</p>

<p>24. And it will come to pass: before they
call, I will answer; they are still speaking,
and I already hear. 25.&nbsp;Wolf and lamb then
feed together, and the lion eats chopped straw
like the ox, and the serpent&mdash;dust is its bread.
They will neither do harm nor destroy in all
My holy mountain, saith Jehovah.</p>

<p class="tdc"><i>Exclusion of Scorners from the Coming
Salvation.</i></p>

<p>1. Thus saith Jehovah: The heaven is My
throne, and the earth My footstool. What
kind of house is it that ye would build Me,
and what kind of place for My rest? 2.&nbsp;My
hand hath made all these things; then all
these things arose, saith Jehovah; and at
such persons do I look, at the miserable and
broken-hearted, and him that trembleth at My
<span class="wsnw">word.<a id="i66_fna1" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#i66_fn1">[1]</a></span> 3.&nbsp;He that slaughtereth the ox is the
slayer of a man; he that sacrificeth the sheep
is a strangler of dogs; he that offereth a meat
offering, it is swine&rsquo;s blood; he that causeth
incense to rise up in smoke, blesseth idols.
As they have chosen their ways, and their
soul cherisheth pleasure in their abominations;
4.&nbsp;so will I choose their ill-<span class="wsnw">treatments,<a id="i66_fna2" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#i66_fn2">[2]</a></span> and
bring their terrors upon them, because I called
and no one replied, I spake and they did not
hear, and they did evil in Mine eyes, and
chose that in which I took no pleasure.</p>

<p>5. Hear ye the word of Jehovah, ye that
tremble at His word: your brethren that hate
you, that thrust you from them for My
name&rsquo;s sake, say, &ldquo;Let Jehovah get honour,
that we may see your joy;&rdquo; they will be put
to shame.</p>

<p>6. Sound of tumult from the city! Sound
from the temple! Sound of Jehovah, who
repays His enemies with punishment.</p>

<p>7. Before she travailed she brought forth;
<span class="pagenum" id="pA87R">[p.&nbsp;A87R]</span>
before pains came upon her, she was delivered
of a boy. 8.&nbsp;Who hath heard such a thing?
Who hath seen anything like it? Are men
delivered of a land in one day? Or is a
nation begotten at once? For Zion hath
travailed, yea, hath brought forth her children.
9.&nbsp;Should I bring to the birth, and not cause
to bring forth? saith Jehovah; or should I,
who cause to bring forth, shut up? saith thy
God.</p>

<p>10. Rejoice ye with Jerusalem, and exult
over her, all ye that love her; be ye delightfully
glad with her, all ye that mourn over her,
11.&nbsp;that ye may suck and be satisfied with
the breast of her consolations, that ye may sip
and delight yourselves in the abundance of
her glory. 12.&nbsp;For thus saith Jehovah, Behold,
I guide peace to her like a river, and the
glory of the Gentiles like an overflowing
stream, that ye may suck; ye shall be borne
upon arms, and fondled upon knees.
13.&nbsp;Like a man whom his mother comforteth, so
will I comfort you, and ye shall be comforted
in Jerusalem. 14.&nbsp;And ye will see, and your
heart will be joyful, and your bones will
flourish like young herbage; and thus does
the hand of Jehovah make itself known to
His servants, and fiercely does He treat His
enemies. 15.&nbsp;For behold Jehovah, in the fire
will He come, and His chariots are like the
whirlwind, to pay out His wrath in burning
of fire. 16.&nbsp;For in the midst of fire Jehovah
holds judgment, and in the midst of His
sword with all flesh; and great will be the
multitude pierced through by Jehovah.
17.&nbsp;They that consecrate themselves and purify
themselves for the gardens behind one in the
midst, who eat swine&rsquo;s flesh and abomination
and the field mouse&mdash;they all come to an end
together, saith Jehovah. 18.&nbsp;And I, their
works and their thoughts&mdash;it comes to pass
that all nations and tongues are gathered
together, that they come and see My <span class="wsnw">glory.<a id="i66_fna3" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#i66_fn3">[3]</a></span></p>

<p>19. And I set a sign upon them, and send
away those that have escaped from them to
the Gentiles, to Tarshish, Ph&ucirc;l and L&ucirc;d, to
the stretchers of the bow, Tubal and Javan&mdash;the
distant islands that have not heard My
fame and have not seen My glory, and they
will proclaim My glory among the Gentiles.
20.&nbsp;And they will bring your brethren out of
all heathen nations, a sacrifice for Jehovah,
upon horses and upon chariots, and upon
litters, and upon mules, and upon dromedaries,
to My holy mountain, to Jerusalem,
saith Jehovah, as the children of Israel bring
the meat-offering in a clean vessel to the house
of Jehovah. 21.&nbsp;And I will also add some
of them to the priests, to the Levites, saith Jehovah.
22.&nbsp;For as the new heaven and the new
<span class="pagenum" id="pA88R">[p.&nbsp;A88R]</span>
earth, which I am about to make, continue
before Me, saith Jehovah, so will your family
and your name continue. 23.&nbsp;And it will
come to pass, from new moon to new moon,
and from Sabbath to Sabbath, all flesh will
come, to worship before Me, saith Jehovah.
24.&nbsp;And they go out and look at the corpses
of the men that have rebelled against Me, for
their worm will not die, and their fire will not
be quenched, and they become an abomination
to all flesh.</p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Neither was any deceit in His mouth.<br />
10.&nbsp;And yet it pleased Jehovah to bruise Him;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He laid sickness upon Him.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But when He has made over His soul as a sin-offering,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He shall see offspring; He shall prolong His days,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the pleasure of Jehovah shall prosper in His hands!</p>

<p>11.&nbsp;Free from the travail of His soul,<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By His knowledge shall my righteous Servant make many righteous,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because He shall bear their iniquities.<br />
12.&nbsp;Therefore will I give Him the great as a portion,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And He shall distribute the strong as spoil.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For He hath poured out His soul unto death,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And He was numbered with transgressors,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While He was bearing the sin of many<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And was making intercession for the transgressors.</p>

<p>LII.&mdash;13. Behold! My Servant shall deal
prudently, He shall be exalted, and extolled,
and be very high. 14.&nbsp;As many were astonied,
so marred more than any man: His visage
and His form more than the sons of men.
15.&nbsp;So shall He sprinkle many nations; kings
shall shut their mouths at Him, for that
which hath not been told them shall they see,
and that which they had not heard shall they
understand.</p>

<p>LIII.&mdash;1. Who hath believed our report?
and the arm of the Lord to whom hath it been
revealed? 2.&nbsp;For He grew up as a tender
plant before Him, and as a root out of a dry
ground. He hath no form nor comeliness
that we should regard Him, and no beauty
that we should desire Him. 3.&nbsp;He was despised
and rejected of men, a man of sorrows
and acquainted with grief. And there was, as
it were, the hiding of the face from Him. He
was despised, and we esteemed Him not.</p>

<p>4. Surely our griefs <span class="smcap">He</span> hath bore, and
our sorrows <span class="smcap">He</span> hath carried them; yet we
did esteem Him stricken, smitten of God, and
afflicted. 5.&nbsp;But <span class="smcap">He</span> was wounded for our
transgressions; He was bruised for our iniquities;
the chastisement of <span class="smcap">our</span> peace (or, our
peace, chastisement) was upon <span class="smcap">Him;</span> and with
His stripes we are healed. 6.&nbsp;All we like
sheep have gone astray, we have turned every
one to his own way, and the Lord hath laid
on Him the iniquity of us all.</p>

<p>7. He was oppressed, and He was afflicted,
yet He opened not His mouth; as the lamb
to the slaughter, He was brought; and as a
sheep before her shearers is dumb, so He
opened not His mouth. 8.&nbsp;He was taken from
prison and from judgment, and who
considereth His generation? For He was cut
off out of the land of the living; for the transgression
of my people was He stricken.
9.&nbsp;And they made His grave with the wicked,
and with the rich in His death, though He had
done no violence, neither was there deceit in
His mouth. 10.&nbsp;Yet it pleased the Lord to
bruise Him; He hath put Him to grief.</p>

<p>When Thou shalt make His soul an offering
for guilt (or, a guilt-offering), He shall see (His)
seed, He shall prolong (His) days, and the
pleasure of the Lord shall prosper in His
hand. 11.&nbsp;Because of the travail of His soul
<span class="pagenum" id="pA69S">[p.&nbsp;A69R]</span>
He shall be satisfied; by His knowledge shall
My Righteous Servant justify the many, for
their iniquities He shall bear. 12.&nbsp;Therefore
will I divide Him a portion in the many [<i>i.e.,</i>
the many shall be the portion allotted to
Him], and with the strong shall He divide the
spoil; for in that He poured out His soul
unto the death, and was numbered with the
transgressors, He Himself bare the sin of the
many, and made intercession for the transgressors.</p>

<li>Regarding the Appendix, in the original, the two translations are presented as two columns on each page. To maintain this
presentation would require more effort than is currently available. Consequently, the two translations
are presented consecutively. The page numbers indicate the page and column. Two additional translations
of chapter lii.&nbsp;13 through chapter liii. appear on appendix pages 67 and 69. These passages follow
the other two translations.</li>
<li>There may have been confusion in typesetting with regard to footnotes. Anchors for the notes on chapters
v. and vi. are inserted into both translations; anchors for subsequent notes appear in the Delitzsch translation
only. Consequently, the notes were transcribed only in the Delitzsch translation. The original footnotes use
symbols, and reset to asterisk with each new page; the transcribed footnotes appear at chapter breaks and
reset to 1 with each chapter.</li>
<li>Verse numbers that appear in the middle of a sentence were often followed by a comma. The transcription
follows each one with a period.</li>

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
